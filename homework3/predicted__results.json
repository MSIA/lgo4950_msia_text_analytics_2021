{"Text":{"0":"Simply put, the food here is bad. I have lived in the South End for 5+ years very close to Emilios and I can honestly say I have never had anything from there that is good. My last straw was a few weeks ago when I ordered a chicken parm sub and there were literally 3 small pieces of chicken in it. I ordered a large. I literally went back in to ask for a new one. The only reason they get 2 stars and not 1 is because the staff is nice. They remade my sub no questions asked. I'd avoid Emlio's and head to Rome Pizza 2 blocks down Tremont street.","1":"I am a fan of the Rusty Bucket just not as big of a fan of their Clintonville location.\n\nThe restaurant itself is still pretty new and is in great condition. This is a place that could be special if the service and food matched the decor and and atmosphere they created. On the positive everything looked clean and tidy in the dining room and the men's restroom was in perfect condition so that is a good start.\n\nStood around for a few minutes before I was greeted and ended up just going to the bar. Got the Bacon burger and fries and it was just sorta mediocre. I don't know if it was sitting on the pass too long or it was just the winter blahs but I have gotten fries for takeout that were warmer when I got home to eat them then I did forty feet from the frier. The taste was there, the heat and freshness weren't.\n\nThe bartender was pleasant but seemed to be overwhelmed between making drinks for the entire place and trying to take care of the people at the bar. Perhaps with another person the drinks would come out faster and all of the customers would have a good experience in the dining room and the bar.  \n\nWhile i did get to park in the parking lot, parking could be a big problem if they have a full house. The planning commision should have required them to have more spots for the number of seats they have.\n\nI will go back to the Rusty Bucket, but it will be awhile before I go to Clintonville. I will definitely go back in the spring when they open everything up so until then I think their Bexley location is the star of their portfolio.","2":"I guess I only endured an IHOP due to the fact there are not a lot of other options and this was convenient.  I can only attribute the relative busy atmosphere and people waiting for a table outside on the fact that most Americans have no idea what a really good breakfast should taste like.\nThe service was great, which is worth two stars.  My server was friendly, attentive, and working hard at all of her tables.  There was a nice guy making balloon creatures for the kids to keep them occupied during the long wait between ordering a meal and when it actually arrives.  The guy made some amazing creations!\nThe food, yuck.  The eggs had no flavor, the bacon was paper thin and mostly fat, and my hash browns were more like hash blacks being thoroughly overcooked.\nSkip this place if you can.","3":"Omg this is the biggest marketing ploy ever. The doughnuts are overly dry topped with overly sweet junk food and crackly icing.  And pricey at that.  If you are craving dry doughnuts with excess amounts of sugary toppings, come here.  Otherwise, even gas stations have better doughnuts for a fraction of the price","4":"First off - it's cash-only.\n\nI don't got to Chinatown often, but when I do, I tend to go at night. Most bakeries are closed by 8, but 101 is one of the only ones still open after then.\n\nThere aren't many Asian bakeries where I live, so I'm not picky and tend to get my go-to, the pineapple bun, though they seem to offer a variety of buns and cakes. Note that by the end of the day, there are maybe a handful\/few options left for buns. When I went, they had pineapple buns scallion buns, and a few others, but they seemed to be the more traditional or simple ones.","5":"This place has it all. Comfortable atmosphere, great food, and an attentive staff. Since everyone is showering this place with high praise and giving food recommendations, I'll just leave you with a few tips.\n\n1) Make a reservation, regardless of the time or day. It never hurts and they'll start to remember you. If you find a waiter\/waitress you like, ask for them (comp'd dishes are great). \n2) Sit away from the door if possible. On a cold winter night or hot summer day, you're going to get a nice blast from outside whenever people open the door. Space is a premium here and they pack the tables closely. \n3) You can order meals while sitting on the bar. It can be faster to sit there than to wait for a table when it's busy. \n4) There's a tiny parking lot. If you're really lucky you'll get a spot. \n5) These guys run the Painted Burro and the new Rosebuds. Check them out if you have a chance. They're all within a stones throw away from each other.","6":"Upon entering the establishment, i was greeted by a waitress who led me to my group. The owner had walked past me mumbling away in in fury. \n\nAs we ordered our food, i decided to go for the calamari combo. A friend who sat next to me ordered his meal. When we got our food, the waitress forgot his appetizer order and told him that she never got his order. The food itself was good. Calamari was cooked just right and the rice was nice and flavourful. \n\nI had to leave earlier so i figured i would be able to pay by card at the front. The waitresses and owner told me that i wasn't able to pay just my share. Apparently with big parties, you would have to pay the final amount at the end. As well, if x amount of people didn't show up as you reserved, you would have to pay an additional $15 for the missing people. The restaurant itself was not busy at this hour which didn't make much sense as to why they weren't able to split for at the time. This had led in a terrible confrontation with the owner, who was disrespectful and rude to a colleague of mine. I left this place in a haste, left with a sour taste in my mouth. Not from the food, but the service.","7":"Very rude staff.  I immediately found a piece of hair in my food and the cook got made that the waitress brought it back.  I will never go back.","8":"I had my first mani and pedi today with Tianna and she is amazing!  She took her time, made sure I was happy with her work and the prices are reasonable.  I have found my new salon and will keep going back.","9":"I checked out this place because of raving reviews and a must place to check out in Columbus. I want to give this place a 0 stars for food and I guess 4 for service. I rate it a 3 stars over all. We came and the buffet was not offered anymore because it was close to 9pm. Buffet?!?! I didn't even know it had one. I go to the buffet bar to check it out and honestly it was gross. I ordered the sausage sampler because they staple snitchzel was made out of pork. Sausages we nothing to write home for. I'm not a big fan of sauercraft, it has some shinny mash potatoes that tasted a bit like lime or dill. Anyway were not good and a side of apple sauce that taste it exactly like apple sauce. Apple sauce? really? what am I, a toddler? and last but not least a piece of bread that looked like a wonder white bread bended in half. Maybe this is pretty good in Germany but honestly I did not like it one bit. Not at fault to the restaurant of course, just my personal taste. I will never come back to this place unless I'm entertaining a German friend.","10":"Tried Hopdoddy while visiting Austin. The place is really chaotic and loud with ordering and paying necessary  before you ever sit down. Fries were delivered first and were not fresh and hot which is necessary with fresh cut fries.\n\nMy food arrived before my beer ever did. When I told the waitress person that I now had my food and still had no drink she barked at me \"do you know how many shakes we have to make right now, you will just have to wait\". I don't like it when a restaurant makes their problems my problem. Plus I think the normal response is \"sorry to here that, let me see if I can get get it for you\" not dirty looks and bad attitude. Can't remember the name of the wait person but it was a girl with a shaved head. Totally rude; she needs to be taught how to properly deal with paying customers as she was rude to my brother's wife as well when she tried to order a beer.\n\nThe bacon cheeseburger was pretty good and cooked to order with a really nice fresh bun. Too bad the rest of the visit was a total disaster. I won't be back  because of the mean wait person,  the pay first format and the weak fries. Had a much better burger and fries at Whataburger and that's fast food.","11":"Some food was catered from the Pepper Pot at an event I attended.  I liked the plantains so much that I had to return for a second helping.  The jerk chicken was great and the rice and beans were perfect.  I must find the location and get more of the Pepper Pot.","12":"I had the pleasure of Angie microblading my eyebrows for me and honestly, it exceed my expectation. The stokes and the appearance were overall very natural. I had a lot of compliments from my workplace and friends! The pain was definitely bearable and it felt like someone deeply scratching into your skin. It is quite dark at first but it will fade roughly 30% or so Angie told me. Amazing job!","13":"Love this place. Great baked goods, salads and sandwiches. I just wish they'd up their coffee game from Fazenda, which is just so so, to something worthy of how great everything else is at the cafe.","14":"My family and I frequent Mangieri's Pizza.  Most of their specialty pizzas are very good.  We like the Mary Ann and the Margarita pizza.  If you live in the area, it should be your go to specialty spot unless you are venturing into the city.","15":"A bunch of convicts, they messed up my tint and they put an illegal eyebrow on it without even asking me? Go back to school is all I have to say to this company.","16":"Total tourist attraction!  I didn't want to take a cab to Downtown Disney or Universal City Walk so we all ended up here. $5 cover charge on a Thursday night.  Not too bad and there was good entertainment.   Drinks were average priced and server came around when needed. It wasn't too crowded nor too loud.  Easy to find a table and plenty of room on the dance floor for those of you that want to groove to blues.","17":"Consistently good, fresh food.  Friendly, excellent service.  Love the servers!  Liz always remembers us and my order!\nI usually get a Greek salad with gyro meat with a pita and taziki (sp?) sauce.  Always yummy.  My husband said that the lamb chops are excellent as well.  Everything we have tried is really, really good.  \nWe are glad to have found the place and will miss it since we are moving out of state...","18":"I am the loving owner of a new puppy. I was chatting with dog owners about daycare and training in the nearby park, at the farmers market and pretty much everywhere I went with my puppy! I live close to Gone to the Dogs so thought it would be convenient. \n\nI was surprised by the number of people who warned me about this place - rude, questionable training methods and poor service.  I disregarded the advice and used them anyways because of the convenience. \n\nBad idea. I pulled my puppy out of there the first week. All of the above reasons and more. Do not subject yourself or your dog to this establishment and their methods.","19":"Beware of this McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks Restaurants...Their Clam Chowder Soup has Bacon in it.  If you use bacon in your Clam Chowder Soup you must say this on the menu! Real authentic Clam Chowder soup is not made with bacon! That is just as bad as ordering Shrimp and Lobster Sauce, and have it come to the table with diced ham in it.  The nerve of some restaurants! At least put it on your menu, and then I will not order it. Otherwise it will get sent back every time by this customer.","20":"Ugh...\nBooked here cuz everything else was sky high ( Fairmont Pacific Rim was 3800$ US  which is 4995$ Canadian FOR ONE NIGHT !!!! \n\nWe got here and checked in. They are a somewhat dated \"all suite hotel\" we had booked on Priceline so the room we got was a Queen suite. My husband joked around about it being our anniversary ( last weekend it was - and we stayed at the JW Merritiot I can't imagine staying here for anything other then necessity )\n\nShe gave us our keys and a old, slow, rickety elevator took us up to the second floor. As soon as we walked in the room reeked if smoke of some sort. As I have allergies, asthma, and had just signed a form stating I would be fined 200$ for in room smoking - we turned around, went back to front desk and asked for a different room. \n\nShe mentioned that we could upgrade to the King jacuzzi suite for 30$ extra. We decided to do this. However she misunderstood and we got keys to another Queen suite in the second floor. This one was way worst then the first. It smelt like an ashtray. My throat got sore and my allergies started up.\n\nOnce again we returned back down to the desk and just said upgrade us please ! \n\nThe King suite on the 4th  much better ! \nThe hallways had some nice glass designs throughout. The carpets were also new that were going down the hall.\n\nThe rooms did appear to be renovated. And \nIt didn't smell like smoke, and had a bigger bed although the \"Queen\" looked more like a double and the \"King\" more like a Queen. \n\nWhen you walk in, there is a small sofa and table. \nThere is a sink across from it as well as a fridge. There may of been a microwave as well but I wasn't looking. \n\nThe bathroom had a jacuzzi tub. We were expecting a jacuzzi in the middle of the room, so it was a slight disappointment but the towels were big and fluffy. \n\nThe room had fresh paint, and the furniture looked to be newer and more modern. However the TV wasn't very big, and they desperately needed to replace the carpet, drapes and smoke detector. You could tell at one point they had been smoked in heavily because of the yellow discolouration. \n\nOur room over looked the outdoor pool & hot tub. We were told they were sold out since May, but I found that hard to believe since we had been in 3 unoccupied rooms and there were only 2 people in the pool.\n\nWe slept in, and check out was at noon, but they never called the room until one or so, then gave us another 45 m to get ready, pack and leave. This was appreciated. \n\nRachel at the restaurant was super nice. But I'll save that for the restaurant review.","21":"Nice people but don't do it.  Take it to the pros.  I am tired of my posting being removed so I'm not writing it again.  Also no stars but maybe if I put up two it will stick.  Do not do business with these people. I think all these posts are from  friends.","22":"I blame Yelp.\n\nFor encouraging me to try new places, not necessarily to find the holy grail of Indian food, but to try more and more places just because they are there. Like Hillary and Everest.\n\nSo its a cold Sunday early evening and I'm craving Indian food. Being a lazy ass, I don't want to travel, so I hit up my best friend - foodler. I skip over my favourite Indian joint in search of pastures new and boy was I disappointed. \n\nFirst the 10% discount off your order at Kabab Corner is a little misleading as all their prices are at least 10-15% higher than similar places, so that's a wash.\n\nThe delivery (quoted 45 minutes) was 1.5 hours. No call. When he did arrive he made up something about bad traffic, but reading these reviews it seems like delivery is probably their biggest challenge. Most of the food was lukewarm at best.\n\nGarlic naan was good, but too small.\nChicken Tikka masala was watery, like they had skimped on the cream.\nLamb Kabab - the lamb was so overcooked and dry it was inedible.\nThe basmati rice was good.\n\nI don't really blame Yelp :) I will continue my quest to try new places and experience new things, but Kabab Corner probably won't be on my revisit list.","23":"If you're in the market for a BMW- reach out to Sheraz Sheikh.  We was outstanding in his dedication to helping me find the right vehicle,  He's patient, responsive and gives honest feedback as to what option is best based on my needs.  He can be reached at: (617)731-1700 ext.126 or email sheraz@herbchambers.com.  I believe he's been at this dealership for 10+ years so there's no lack of knowledge and his commitment to custom service is excellent.\n\nCongratulations to Mr. Herb Chambers for employing such people as Sheraz.  I would highly recommend theirs services, and specifically ask for Sheraz.","24":"We wanted a table outside, so the wait wasn't too long.  If you go, you HAVE to get the Magic Shroom burger!!! This was the best freaking burger we have ever had (sorry Beck's Prime, you're now number 2)!!!  Anytime someplace includes goat cheese, I have to try it.  I was not disappointed in the least!  It was so incredibly scrumdiddliumtious!!!!","25":"Caveat Emptor when leaving your car with these guys. The theme for this shop is volume. They will fix something, if it's broken or not. I took my car there on twoseparate occasions, and not once did they just fix the problem that existed. On the last occasion, I brought the car in for a tire rotation, they claimed my radiator was broken. I took it to another shop, and they fixed a problem that did not exist prior to my Lamb's visit. Never again will they get my money.","26":"While everyone enjoyed their meal mine was a terrible experience. My meat was undercooked and I has asked for medium well. When i received my food back on the first bite it tasted like I got a spoon full of salt.  I complained to the the manager but he was not accommodating at all. He told to go back to my seat which I then realized he doesn't care. I would skip this place.","27":"UGHHHHHHH WORST SALON EVER!!! Came here for convenience and because their thing is \"no appointment\" yeah right. I walked in and was turned away. They asked to call in the morning to make an appointment. Why???? Why can't you just make the appointment then and there? That should of been a red flag for me but I came here a few days after and the lady who cut my hair was this big lady with blondish hair. She had the most apathetic attitude. She treated me like she was doing me the favor. She took a good 10 MINUTES at the most cutting my hair and did not even ask me to look it over when she was done. She yanked the Cape off me and told me the total was $17. I came home and washed and styled my hair to find out my hair was uneven and choppy!!! I'm so mad right now! Maybe 17 dollars is on the cheaper side of hair cuts but it was a total waste of money knowing I have to go some where else to get it redone. Where do they get these hair dressers? Beauty school drop outs? I've seen cosmetology students with better skills than this lady. Dear God.","28":"Terrible experience. Went to Disney using this cab service. Upon entering we tried to pay the 15$ for the cab driver to enter the parking lot. Disney employees would not let us pay and said it was the responsibility of the driver. Offered the driver money and instead he drove us and dropped me off at a random resort. I got out of the cab after calling his dispatcher and telling her I would not be paying the fair since I did not end up at my final destination. Instead I was dropped off at an unknown destination and was followed into the lobby by the driver who was demanding I pay him. Why would I pay for a a car ride when I ended up nowhere near my destination. Awful situation. Avoid this company.","29":"Dots, dang it, why can't you clean your bathrooms? Love the velvety wallpaper, love the retro-kitsch lighting, love the fries, the grilled cheese... I even don't mind the cash only policy. But the bathroom was DISGUSTING. Maybe its the unisex thing, I don't know - but it smelled worse than an overworked Honey Pot on day 3 of Dave Matthews. Worse than the epic-ly bad bathrooms at Satyricon (in the day). Worse than...I can't even tell you. \n\nBleh.","30":"I came here couple times. One time, my company had a party here or should I say a seasonal event. Scavenger hunt and afterward came here for appies and drinks. The appies are not bad. Drinks well like most restaurants, you can get whatever drink you can think of. \n\nSo couple weekends ago, I came here for brunch. Got one of those coupon 2 benny for $20. Not bad. Too bad they ran out of the smoke salmon benny. But oh well. Got the shrimp benny instead. It was pretty good. Except the potatoe was a bit spicy. Well next time I will get them to sub it with fries instead. Also it had a side salad. Yummy.\n\nDefinitely coming back.","31":"Good news\/bad news time.\n \nGood news: My frittata of the day was pretty tasty, as was the green tea latte I tried. Bad news: I don't find this place to be as memorable as their \"big brother\" Chambar (they're run by the same people). My husband got the fricassee, which I was tempted by, but was glad I didn't get. I tried a few bites, and while the bacon inside was AMAZING, the sauce was way too sherry vinegary. I wouldn't have been able to eat the whole plate of it. The housemade ciabatta bread had way, WAY too many herbs in it, and not the right kind. It tasted like your basic \"Italian seasoning\" blend had been accidentally spilled into a batch of the bread. I usually LOVE bread, and kept taking tiny bites in hopes that I'd like it, but despite its warmth and freshness, I just wasn't a fan of the flavor. \n \nGood news: Belgian waffles are legit - really good, with crunchy bits of pearl sugar within. We got the mixed berry compote and dark chocolate sauces to go with. We shared a small waffle in addition to our own entrees and coffees, but really. These things are so good you'll want to hog one for yourself. Also good is their lavender latte. The green tea latte was alright, but near the end you're left with a cup of green milk after you've had all the foam, which is weird and not as good. I think the lavender latte wins.\n\nI think the perfect Caf\u00e9 Medina experience would really just be to get a coffee and a waffle (EACH!) and enjoy. The scrambles\/frittatas\/fricassees I've tried here just haven't been memorable. Hot and eggy, cheesy, meaty, yes. Good enough for me to come back and try them again? Nope. I've been here a few times when traveling up to Vancouver and each time I get something different (other than the waffle, duh) but nothing has made me think \"WOW, I need to come back here!\"\n\nThis place falls into my \"pretty solid, but there are lots of other places I want to try, too, and it wasn't amazing enough to keep me coming back\" category.","32":"Not the cleanest hospital I have been too... I can say that I was kinda shocked when I had to pay my copayment at the time of service... I was also surprised when they WOULD NOT bill me for my copayment and held all of my discharge info until I made payment... The doctors and nurses seemed very nice, but I will TRY not to come back to this hospital again.","33":"I've recently seen P-Funk and Get The Led Out (A Led Zeppelin cover band) and had a great time at both shows.  \n\nHoB is a great place to see and hear a show.  We moved around quite a bit and always had a good sight line and clear sound no matter where we stood.  \n\nBeers are expensive but this is not unexpected.  I have no complaints but there was nothing super special about the place that would warrant that fourth star.","34":"I couldn't be more disappointed.  From start to finish it was just so mediocre.  No, it didn't even hit mediocre.  The table we sat at was at the front and it was cold.  We weren't acknowledged by our server for at least 10 minutes. My husband asked for ground pepper and he had to ask a second time.  It was needed to add flavor to a bland chicken, ziti and broccoli.  I had a ravioli with lobster that was very pedestrian.  We had a restaurant.com certificate and the server even had it stapled to the bill, but shame on us - they did not apply it.  The credit card statement showed the full amount of the bill and restaurant.com shows the cert is still good.  I won't be using it.  This was our second and last visit to Viola.  If I'm paying to go out to eat - the service needs to be better than at home.","35":"Patient Portal: Couldn't get on. \"Talk to ***\"\" except s\/he's on vacation.\" Call back, \"well you should be able to get on.\" OK I can't. OK do this, OK now I can, except ***there's nothing there.***\n\n\"Yes, it isn't very user friendly.\" \n\nTry again. OK there is stuff there. Very little stuff there, except for two sets of chart notes, nothing, no lab results, nothing else especially useful. The Portal, aside from being difficult to access in the first place, is slightly better than useless. I really like my doctor, but like a typical American, I never actually go.","36":"International Drive has a few delights, and Boteco is surely among them. This Brazilian restaurant is in a very touristy strip mall on International Drive just off Oak Ridge Road and across from Festival Bay. It opened in June 2012.\n\nThe decor adopts a less-is-more attitude. It's airy with mostly tables and a few booths on one side, with just a few colorful abstract prints along the dark-wood walls. A well-appointed full bar is along one end of the restaurant. Quiet samba music is played. There is outdoor seating, but the view isn't much to behold.\n\nMy entree was a Shrimp Stroganoff (Strogonoff de Camarao), shrimp saut\u00e9ed in a wonderful sauce with peas and served with white rice. At first taste, I wanted to ask for the recipe. I chose a side of Fried Yucca.\n\nMy dining partner's choice was a Filet Mignon ordered rare and his two sides were sweet plantains and farofa, a toasted flour made of yucca, in vinaigrette. His verdict on the filet was that it was \"superb.\"\n\nFor dessert I chose a Passion Fruit Mousse accompanied with espresso.\n\nTake note: a gratuity is included on the bill.\n\nI'm making a new list and it will certainly include Boteca. It will be called \"You Don't Know Jack,\" for those who believe that Orlando doesn't have good dining options. Skip the nearby Texas de Brazil chain and give this indie a try instead.\n\nDe nada.","37":"Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah fishies!!!\n\nI've only been to two other aquariums in my life and I must say this is the most impressive, fantastic and defiantly worth every penny aquarium I've ever been too. \n\nLet me start off by saying parking is sometimes a nightmare! Especially on the weekends! Heaven forbid I have to drag myself here on the weekend there will be hell to pay and probably blood split... from someone knocking me out from cursing too much.\n\nSo many delicious fish, uh I meant really cool fish to see here. There was some fish from Africa that was over 4.5 meters long! Holy mother of mackerel! After seeing his ugly mug, I was glad I didn't live in Africa. He looked like a great coyote ugly candidate though (believe me I've have some winners) \n\nThey have this cool butterfly exhibit and let me tell you,  I HATE INSECTS!! I almost killed just about everyone they flew right past me. I can just hear it on the news.... \"Today at the Vancouver Aquarium, a young lady swatted and killed the last known orange butterfly that was on display...\" Don't fly so close next time you damn, dirty, orange butterfly!!!\n\nThe coolest part of our tour was getting a chance to see the beluga whale. We waited about 30 minutes in line since they only let a few people in at a time. You also have to follow a few rules:\n\n1) No flash photographer since the sun glasses we gave the whales are not water proof. \n2) Keep your noise level down because beluga's are sensitive to your precious snow flake screaming at the top of their lungs when they see the whale float by in the glass. \"OMFG MOMMY A BIG FISHIE!!!!!\"\n3) Stay behind the orange cones... this means you little girl touching and licking the glass wall.... ewwwwww!\n\nThe dolphin tank is pretty cool. I don't think I've seen a dizzy dolphin before. Or should I say I don't know why they're not dizzy after swimming around and around and around and around and around and around...  uhhhh oh god I'm gona be sick!!\n\nbtw don't try and eat the food here. The line is ridiculously long and there's hardly any place to sit. I was so hungry I almost went into the touch tank and grabbed myself a sea urchin. What? If the otters eat them, then they must be good!","38":"I'm a fan of fitness classes, I find it so much easier to work out with a group than it is to work out on your own, there's more motivation. That said, I joined LA Fitness primarily for their variety in classes & have checked out Yoga, Zumba, & Body Works so far. Danielle is great for yoga, Noelia is my favorite for Zumba & I'm still trying to get into Body Works but still think is a good class to go to if you're looking to get toned. \n\nIf you're looking for a place where you can do cardio & then hit weights LA Fitness is also a good option. There are plenty of machines & thus far I haven't had a problem accessing what I want to do (even during peak hours). I love that all the treadmills & ellipticals have TVs, makes the time goes by very fast. All their machines seem to be newer & maintained well. \n\nThat said, not all is good: The parking situation is a mess & my experience with the free personal training session that comes with your membership wasn't good. Plus, even if I did like the personal training, the cost for it is not pocket friendly. \n\nThere are other perks I haven't tried yet like racquetball courts, swimming pool, sauna, smoothie bar & kids care. All this for about $30\/month, not too shabby!","39":"Really delicious but they overlooked the excessive fish fat on one entree and the cartilage in the meat loaf.  So close to delicious had they paid just paid more attention to detail.","40":"Patio dining was a complete disappointment. The area was so freezing and the propane heaters gave me a headache since the tanks had to be replaced. Food got cold so quickly I could not actually enjoy to give a fair review.","41":"Had to, just had to try it. One of Todd English's first restaurants. So we went for lunch.The food was excellent. Parking was not the easiest to find but circling and circling was worth it. In NY where I grew up pizza was thin crust in a wood burning oven with sauce and cheese just a classic pizza, and we were happy. Not anymore. The Fig and prosciutto pizza was amazing. Who knew you could have pizza with out tomato sauce (ok I knew but it sounded better!) The crust was nice and crisp with a little char flavor which was balanced by the sweetness of the figs with just a hint of salt from the prosciutto. I was surprised to see Brussels sprouts on the menu but they came highly recommended as did the meatballs. A very delightful afternoon.","42":"I'm not leaving without my smoothie because I'm in a hurry but the place is not the cleanest!  There are containers left out everywhere and the sinks look like they haven't been clean in at least a week. I'd think that'd be a daily task. There is a planet smoothie down the road and they are much more clean AND FRIENDLY!  Wouldn't come back.","43":"Where to go for Dim Sum that is close enough for those who live downtown and central enough for others that need parking?\nSzechuan Chongqing Seafood restaurant.  They have Cantonese Dim Sum during the day.\n\nAlong side the regular dishes, this summer they were serving freshly squeezed orange juice and had some szechuan green beans to kick up the flavour buds over the regular dim sum fare.\n\nMade reservations for 11 am the day before.  We arrived and were one of the first tables there.  The nice thing about eating early is that it's early enough that nobody has had breakfast and late enough on a weekend that the younger generation would be up to eat.\n\nSome of the dishes are not as plump as say some of the more modern Chinese restaurants, but they still have the carts and they also do table service.  You can get the best of both worlds.\n\nWe had Gai lan with oyster sauce which was quite nice.\nFresh and hot food came to us pretty fast.  So fast that we didn't have time to eat when the table was full of food.\n\nWe had to turn away dishes food was coming so fast.\n\nFree parking in the back if you arrive early enough and there is also street parking as well.\n\nPeople would ask why this place.  Well, it has a special place in my heart that's why.\n\nGreat service today.\n\nAnd the balcony was open so you could have your dim sum outdoors and enjoy the sunshine.","44":"This place gets packed! SO stay ready to be on a wait especially if you come on a weekend. But I can honestly say that it was worth the wait. Every bite was scrumptious and their burgers was actually delicious. I am not a burger person, but I guess everytime I come visit Austin, I don't mind coming back to this place.. I just need to make sure it's not a Saturday night!","45":"Burgers are just okay, fantastic if you are drunk and looking for late night food to sober you up. Otherwise, sober-you will question your choices. You've got to get the burger with all of the toppings on it, chips, sauces, etc, or it doesn't taste that great. Get a plain burger from the value menu at McDonald's instead if that's how you roll.","46":"Was on the fence of my rating but ended with a 3-star rating.  Rose City Book Pub has a lot of potential.  They took over the old County Cork pub and, well, it still looks a lot like that pub albeit a little brighter.  \n\nThey have food and beer.  Didn't try any food but the beer selection was pretty good.  We did have a hiccup with our small order of one beer and some tea.  The guy who took the order was awesome, super nice, but I think he was just out front while the normal guy was taking a break.  He went to the kitchen and our tea was forgotten.  The \"normal\" guy didn't look like he knew what the heck to do about anything and even had to go to the kitchen so the \"awesome\" guy could open a bottle of wine for other patrons.  Mr. Awesome came out to us and apologized, brought the tea, and waived it.  Hopefully they can figure that part out. \n\nThere are a couple of couches, but unless you can read a long time in a booth or chair, you might tire of reading quickly.  They have bookshelves stocked with used and new books.  Didn't really browse them too much as I was there to hang out and read my own book.  Maybe some signage about book prices or policies would be nice.  Are they a bookstore? \n Are these books for us to read while we are here?  Questions I didn't quite know how to answer.  \n\nThey have some fun things on the tables like \"write a poem and we'll put it on our wall\" and fun stuff like that.  \n\nThe thing that was odd was that it was so quiet there.  They really could use some coffee shop music or something.  I don't think it would bother anyone.\n\nI would certainly give this place another try in the future and hope to increase my rating once they iron out some kinks.","47":"Awesome sandwich joint with friendly staff. Love that they've got plenty of options to choose from. Wish they had more seats but overall, a cool lil spot.","48":"Old building? I get it.\nSmall elevators? I get it...it's like two people elevator! \n\nRoom? It need better vacuuming work. \nAs a frequent traveler, it's not difficult to see when floor isn't vacuumed. It's gross to see clipped nails and other gross stuff\n\nIt's really a two stars but kudos for clean towers, nice bed and love the bedding sheets! Great location and friendly check in front desk as well!!\n\nSince this is not a cheap motel price, rooms really need to be clean.  Building is old tired but rooms don't need to be! Look at the great beds and bed liners!! They were so clean, smooth and comfortable!!","49":"Decent location of a decent fried chicken chain.  If you haven't tried Chicken Express, I'd call it a mix between a KFC's and a Popeye's, with a bit of Long John Silver's thrown in. \n\nThis is a relatively new location, and I suspect that they're still ironing out kinks in their ordering\/personnel system.  The staff I dealt with were friendly enough, and the store was clean.  However, it wasn't the fastest service (and I was one of only three people there!) and I had to come back to get one of the side items, which hadn't been put on the tray.  \n\nThis is perfectly serviceable fast food, not particularly inspiring or tender, when it comes to the chicken. I went with a set of Chicken Tenders which, while nice enough, weren't all that hot (again, that speed thing) and actually surprisingly chewy for 'tenders'  The gravy's surprisingly decent and the biscuit okay, though I like KFC's take on it better.  I also tried out the fried catfish, which again was decent but on the bland side compared to what I'm used to.  \n\nSo, on the whole, a decent place to stop at if you're passing by, I just can't see going out of my way to come here over, say, a KFC or a basket of home-cooked fried chicken.\n\nThis place scores a 3 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.\n\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here.\n4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.\n3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad.\n2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here.\n1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either.","50":"Very poor customer service! Been there twice and was disappointed both times with how rude the people were there Especially the regular guy who works there in the mornings. Today I sent someone to grab food for a company event from there and she came back in a bad mood telling me that they made her feel stupid.  Not sure if the owner of this bakery reads these comments but if he does, he should know that he has a serious problem there that needs to address.","51":"Found a long black hair in my fries. The server just explained how they fry their fries, great..... how about getting me some un hairy fries or not charging me for hairy fries","52":"A friend recommended this to us. I think something is severely wrong with his tastebuds because this food was like a freezer burnt dollar tree microwave meal. There was no flavor at all, the spicy food was not at all spicy, and the egg foo young almost brought me to tears. While the service was very kind and attentive, it is not worth spending a dime on.","53":"My fianc\u00e9 and I ordered lunch to go, we had two gyros.  They were dripping grease, I had never eaten a gyro that dripped grease. We attempted to place our order over the phone, but was advised not to because our pita bread might become soggy.  That should've been the warning sign. Our sandwiches didn't have cucumber sauce, it was more like sour cream. We will never be back.","54":"In my quest of trying new places in Chinatown, I ended up here today for lunch. A couple of differences between this place and its cousin Pho Pasteur on Washington... this is much cleaner than Pasteur, but their servings are much smaller, to the point of being stingy actually. I could literally count the number of shrimps in my entree, they were 5. I ordered Shrimp and vegetables stir fry with Vermicelli. Since the portions are small, I was starvin' like Marvin again in no time. Prices are reasonable. Also had the Vietnamese coffee to go which was definitely below average.","55":"Be careful of the \"non verbal I upsale\".  Went in for the spa pedi walked out paying $5 more than expected.  When I asked I was told that it was due to callus sluffing.  I took a moment to think, \" she did ask about dry skin...\"  And then I had a terrifying minute on each foot  as she used what can only be described as a cheese grater--horrific.  I do get pedicures frequently so not sure why they used this..  Oh..  To charge me extra....  No thanks.. The fish are cool, but it's not a friendly atmosphere and I paid more for discomfort.","56":"Really really good out of 6 happy hour dishes only 1 was so-so. Come get it\n\nSt. Louis park neighborhood is classic and hip","57":"how long has this place been around? yeah. it's been there for at least a few years now, right? and this was my first trip up there. i happened to be in the area for work, around lunchtime, and thought i'd give it a shot. \n\nso... it's well past the lunch \"rush\" and looking around the small dining room, most folks are eating, or finishing up. good sign. i was hoping to run in, grab a quick lunch, and get back to the task at hand (saving the planet...)\n\ni mean, i guess i've been to slower places, but i really can't remember when. my server? awesome. apologetic. cordial. \n\nthe food? amazing. i had the bbq tempeh sandwich. deciding was not easy. the entire menu sounded amazing, as well as one of the two specials. i decided on the sandwich because i figured it'd be quick, and it sounded tasty. i will say, that it's one of the best bbq tempeh sandwiches i've had in a long time. the sauce? pleasantly tangy. it had some sort of purple cabbage relishy thing on it, and came with a tasty salad. \n\nwhy it took almost 35 minutes for me to get said sandwich? i'm not so sure. with one person preparing dishes, seemingly one at a time, and a second person intermittently in the kitchen area doing prep work, i guess it makes sense. well.. it doesn't make SENSE, but i see where the hold up is. \n\nall in all, a good experience. i'll be back to try some more of the items, however, i can only imagine what it might be like during a \"rush\" time... hopefully the cooks can learn to multi-task a bit..","58":"Overall I had a good experience at Empire.  I came here on a Wednesday for a drink with some friends.  The hostess and server were both quite nice and service overall was spot on (checked in on just often enough).  The drinks were creative and got some good reviews and my scotch was neat!","59":"Outstanding customer service. One of my wheels was bent pretty badly after grazing a cement lane divider. I really appreciated that they tried to repair the wheel before deciding it had to be replaced. Still, they found me a great deal, so the replacement only ended up costing a little more than the repair would have. And once the wheel came in, it only took them 10 minutes to replace it. Would definitely recommend this place. It's apparent they have a very well run business.","60":"Hmmm, I ordered a sour cream & chive baked potato and a water.  I had to ask three times for my water.  My potato had no chives.  Seriously?","61":"Average, with so many options for latin cuisine in the area, this place was just decent.  The good: Price was right, relleno de papa, yellow rice and beans, serving the mayo-ketchup for the tostones.  The not-so-good: churrasco didn't have that good grilled flavor, service.","62":"It was just ok. Went in for a savory waffle. Had the farm fusion. You can tell they use good ingredients but they add or maybe it's in the waffle mix; sugar crystal like beads to the savory waffles. So that savory waffle had bites of sugar which was kinda gross and didn't work with spinach and the other ingredients. Had the waffle not had sugar lumps it would have been pretty tasty and affordable but that sweetness left a bad taste in my mouth and turned me off. Not a fan and won't go back unless maybe I wanted all sweet.","63":"My wife and I decided to try this place with our daughter a few weeks ago, I think on the 17th of December.  Breweries are usually fun places and upstairs there was an area for our daughter to roam and play with a brio-like train.  Not much to say, I ordered a burger with tomato, onion, and cheese.  I decided against having any catsup or mustard and ate it plain.  It tasted slightly fizzy, and from what I could tell the cheese was what was just slightly fizzy.  Other than that we enjoyed our meal.  Not the best burger I've had, but not a bad evening either.","64":"This has the feel of a total tourist trap. The service was nothing to rave about and the food was bland, especially for the price. \n\nBoston has so much more to offer. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else.","65":"Best green hot sauce in town. Very reasonably priced. Great little hole in the wall restaurant. The parking is a little crazy but well worth it.","66":"Place looks a little shady. Like a hole in the wall hidden gem type of place. Didn't even know they serve Viet food. Bar side looks newer than the restaurant side. Restaurant side looks very run down. \n\nVery tasty Bo luc lac (tender chunks of wine marinated beef grilled with tomato and onion) and Flavorful bun Bo hue(spicy beef noodle soup) \n\nCan't wait to try their fish sauce wings. I would come back again for authentic Viet food.","67":"I have to start by saying that this place has a fantastic ambience, displays great art and has a great choice of teas from everywhere.\n\nHaving that said, it's missing a couple of key ingredients that a tea shop should possess. \n\n1) There are so many choices of teas available, which is a great thing.  It's the McDonalization of tea. This is great, but having tasted more than 10 teas here on multiple occasions as I really want to see a local business succeed, I am yet to taste a tea that is that tastes like how it should taste. For example, the Kashmiri tea tastes nothing like a Kashmiri tea and a chai is called a 'chai tea latte.' \n\n2) The human element behind serving tea is missing. Seems like every-time someone dumps a tea pot or a glass on your table and seeks no feedback as to how tea should be made, or what can be improved in my tea. \n\n3) As a recommendation to do better, I would hope that the baristas are more familiar how to indulged in making global teas and most of the menu is international. The art of making a good tea goes more that latte'ing' or putting tea in hot milk. Learning from the legs of Tao of Tea on Belmont, where a Chinese tea is served how it is served, or an indian tea smells like a Darjeeling tea leaves would help improve the quality of tea making.\n\nI really hope to see this place improve in the quality of tea making. Everything else is fantastic here!","68":"They did an awful job, and I still paid $40, even though they acknowledged that my nails look like sh*t!  They upsell you in everything as well.  My nails are lumpy and look like I did them myself!  The best nail salon in town thus far has been the Organic Nails and lash spa.  I am new to Austin, and have been searching for the best, and they are it.   Go there instead-they are meticulous and they won't let you leave until your nails are perfect.","69":"Went to Pho Tan for dinner tonight and was not impressed at all.  The food was ok.  \n\nThe pho was average.  The egg crepe\/lettuce wrap was greasy and bland.\n\nBut the worst part was that our order of steamed crepes came out with a hair on it!  Ok fine, it happens.  We sent it back and we could hear the kitchen staff asking the manager if we expected the dish to be remade??!?  What?  Isn't that kind of obvious.  I heard the manger say yes, remake it.  However when it came back out again, there was ANOTHER HAIR in the dish!!!!  \n\nWhen we showed it to the manager again, he did not look pleased... with us!!  Not even an apology!  He took the dish and returned later and threw the bill on the table.  The offending item was crossed off.  \n\nI've had better Vietnamese (hair-free) food and I have certainly had better service.  I won't be returning to Pho Tan!","70":"Comfort Food in a Dis-Comforting Place!  Park under the Bridge, watch out for trolls.  Keep your head on a swivel as your cross the street, Boston Drivers see you as a slalom obstacle.  Wait in a line?  It's possible!  It's that good.  Enter and enjoy the Formica ambiance.... Ah the smells of wood smoke... \nLamb, Sausage over a wood fire.  Pizza the same.  Buy too much, eat a lot you won't regret it.  Bold?  Get a hot cherry pepper pizza.  Eat the home made bread if the cherry peppers get to you, water won't put out a cherry pepper fire.\nLow key date place.  Spirited wait staff. :)\n\nIf you are at all fussy, this is not a place for you!  They do what they do...nothing else...  nothings better...","71":"I received a promotional email for Avenue Five, offering $5 Skin Ceuticals Facials on Wednesdays in March.  I decided to book one since it was such a good deal and I had been happy with previous facials at A5.  When I called to book the appointment, I specfically mentioned the email and that I wanted to book the $5 facial.  While the facial I recieved was great (Haley did a lovely job!), when I went to pay I was shocked when my bill was $40.00  I questioned the amount, reiterating the email and how I had specifically asked for the promotional $5 facial when I booked.  The front desk girl went to get some guy, who said he had sent the email and that it was a misprint, he'd meant to say that it was $5 OFF.  I asked why he did not send a follow up email then to correct the misprint.  His response was since only 15 people had booked the facial he didn't see the need.  I asked why they hadn't informed me of the misprint when I booked and he said that they should have.  I then asked why I wasn't informed when I checked in on the day of service to which he had no reply.  I understand that mistakes happen but they had three easy opportunities to relay this information and did not.  his is false advertising.  I do not feel that I should have been charged as I was.Clearly this business does not operate truthfully.  I intend to file a formal complaint with the BBB.","72":"It's a beautiful word to say -- \"suh-vee-chay.\"  I've been to Church Street's Ceviche for Sunday brunch and dinner.  The joint is lovely, not quite as lovely as when Lili Marlene's occupied the space, but lovely still.\n\nOne would think that Ceviche would be the signature item on the menu, but there are places that do a better job. Paradiso 37 is one.\n\nOn both visits I've found this tapas restaurant to be nice, probably better than El Bodegon, but not quite as good as Mi Tomatina.  It's hard to make a comparison to I-Drive's Cafe popular Cafe Tu Tu Tango.\n\nIf you go there for brunch, you might be immediately taken by the description of the Lord Baltimore Crab Eggs Benedict, but the outcome didn't quite deliver.\n\nService is hit or miss.  On my dinner visit, until after I left the restaurant, I didn't notice that our sardine tapas never arrived.  \n\nThe list of options on the menu is overwhelming; sometimes the delivered goods fail to overwhelm.  The big windows with the view to Church Street are a plus.","73":"This was our second visit and we were soooo hungry when we arrived. It was Saturday morning and packed. After waiting 10 minutes we were seated. Ordered an Ultimate skillet. Salt-laden, potatoes seemed microwaved. Staff was pleasant.","74":"Been going here 15+ years and this place never disappoints. Willie's Plate all the way!","75":"Ah, glorious corporations.\n\nThis store is (under)staffed with disenchanted employees who are frantically trying to sell you whatever piece of poo their manager arranges for them to sell that day. The register is a game of twenty questions, none of which I am capable of answering correctly. \nThe Info Desk, should instead be called the Desk of Great Confusion, as there is rarely anyone helpful around, and the computer system is full of lies. Well, before I sound like a crazy person, let me 'splain. Most of the time it says things are in stock, when they're not. Other times, it will just point you in the direction of the TOTALLY wrong section, and when you ask for help from an employee, they usually reference the same information and then throw up their hands in disgust and squirrel away as fast as they possibly can. \nThe selection of materials is okay. So is the selection of materials at every other bookstore around here. I'd rather shop somewhere else and save myself some trouble. Someone needs to put Borders out of it's misery.","76":"I was so excited to eat pho hungover. I couldn't wait to eat the hot, steamy, flavorful broth to slurp with thin noodles and drench in Sriracha and brown sauce.\n\nThis place has definitely gone downhill from what I remember. The broth is not flavorful at all, and was missing a kick. They gave us lemons instead of limes, and I felt like I couldn't taste anything when I squeezed it into my soup. The broth wasn't even hot when we got it. Even the meat wasn't good. It wasn't tender, soft, or chewy like I wanted it to be.\n\nOverall it's seriously only good if you NEED pho and you live close by. Also, it's cheap compared to other restaurant's in the area. Use your 10% off coupon if you have it. Otherwise, go to China Town.","77":"(Review written from the perspective of a diner in the next booth over)\n\nSince my wife had our son a few months ago, we've been pretty much sequestered to our house.  Not content to spend another night choking down strained peas and applesauce, we put our faith in a babysitter and headed to Ranch 616 for our first night of freedom.\n\nEven though it was prime time on Friday night, in less than fifteen minutes, we were scooting into a roomy booth against the back wall.  The decor was a cool hodgepodge of modern, Western and 50s diner.  Our server was quick and attentive; it almost felt like we were his only table.  He delivered our champagne on ice, and we eagerly awaited the arrival of their famous fried oysters to really kick the romance into high gear.\n\nJust as I was about to make a joke about baby #2 being an inevitability with all the aphrodisiacs on the table, a coven of obnoxious girls burst through the door squawking and squealing like spray-tanned pigs on the Titanic.  And guess where the hostess seated them?  At the booth next to ours, of course.  At this point our 'special night' turned into a complete horror show.\n\nWithout hesitation, they ordered a round of complicated, neon drinks, but ended up sloshing most of their cocktails on the table when they attempted a toast to \"Gettin' lucky tonight.\"  Like driving under a bridge during a torrential rain, that first group gulp created a sudden peace in the restaurant, but soon the storm beat down on us once again.\n\n\"Ugh!  My Pink Taco is all watery!\" exclaimed a bleary-eyed brunette.\n\n\"Yeah, that's what your boyfriend told me last night,\" countered her platinum blonde compatriot.\n\nCackling and a chorus of \"Oooh\" erupted from the table.\n\nThey must have been gearing up for a showing of Sex and the City because I have never heard women's problems discussed in public at such a loud volume.  I began to pray that our food would come out soon so we could woof it down and be on our way.  Moments later, our entrees appeared and they were everything we hoped they'd be:  Fresh and flavorful with well-balanced flavor profiles.  And, lest we think it was a fluke, we also got a play-by-play review of the cuisine by our neighbors.\n\n\"OMG, you guys!  The Escolar is daaaaaaaa bomb.  I'm going to hire someone to sesame-encrust everything I eat from this day forward.\"\n\n\"Y'all, would it be bad manners to chug this cup of ceviche?  I think there's booze in it.\"\n\n\"This fried asparagus is worth funny-smelling pee.\"\n\nWe were mortified.  I looked at my wife, grabbed her hand, told her a million times that I love her and thanked my lucky stars to have found the last good girl on the face of the earth.","78":"this is part three of the four part series titled \"the worst tour\".  please see my review of bennigans for back story.\nwe visited the tgif's on town lake under the radisson.  so guess what, there were tourists everywhere.  the beer selection was subpar and we were surrounded by tourists.  that doesn't deserve two stars does it?  i said it previously, that good service can even make a dump bearable and our server brittany did just that.  she took care of our birthday boy in tow that was not having a good time since we had just been to bennigans and hooters (part one and two of \"the worst tour\").  she brought out shots at her discretion and was very prompt and friendly.  she gets the two stars, not the establishment.  typical chain bullshit.  stuff thrown up on the wall to give the impression or originality, radio quality music, etc.  \nwell, jake almost thought \"the worst tour\" was over as we headed into downtown, but he was mistaken.  time for the worst of the worst.  hello coyote ugly!!","79":"Just left this restaurant after sitting more than 40 minutes waiting for a to-go order of 3 entrees.  Really?  There were more employees than customers.  And the employees spent more time discussing what was needed and running back & forth than actually serving diners.  Regardless of how everything tastes, I will not be back.","80":"One of the worst bubble teas I've had, kungfu tea and chatime in Boston are incredibly superior. The milk tea is  very diluted, it lacks condensed milk. The tea is also over brewed and tastes very bitter, pretty much scrapes your palate.","81":"We were underwhelmed. The food was ok, not remarkable, yet the prices were outrageous. The ambience was fun and service good, but we won't be going back.","82":"I like the stylist. She's nice but today was a complete waste. I went in get chocolate color. I paid 130.00 and my hair is the exact same color as it was when I went in. She just couldn't get it right. On top of that, she couldn't style it. My hair is a complete mess. I don't know why I can't find a stylist that can color!","83":"I have been a regular customer of the howling wolf for several years and must say I am taking the time to write this review because of a horrendous floor manager that was nothing short of rude, inconsiderate, unprofessional and in no way should have the management title attached to her name. I was there on Wednesday May 20 and was approached by the so called, restaurant manager who proceeded to DEMAND I stop smoking an e-cigarette because of Massachusetts Law restrictions.  I responded very calmly (although she was exceptionally rude) by saying \"if this is restaurant  policy that's fine, but please do not tell me it is Mass Law because it isn't. \" Long story short I stopped using it when she demanded and she came back to our table of 7 with typed papers literally throwing it in my face and said \"here is the law\". I was appalled that after 45 minutes she would come back but looked at the papers and laughed when I read \"Arkansas Law\". I reminded her we are in Massachusetts and that I have not touched my ecig since her request. She was shaking and literally said \"I want you to leave right now\". I refused and she called the Salem police who confirmed there is no such law in place.  Our waiter even apologized  for her bad behavior.  I have no problem with policies and procedures of any establishment but regardless her behavior was uncalled for and I will take my complaint to the general manager.  Moving forward I will never visit this restaurant again based on this experience.","84":"What can I say. I mean...I was really excited to hear about this place but we walked out super disappointed.\nWhen it comes to buddhist veggie vietnamese for me...it is all about the pho. \n\nAt Van Hanh they made super bland pho. No flavor at all.  Plain. The spicy soup we ordered tasted like pain. Just a bunch of pepper (the bad kind of hot) and no flavor. \n\nThen, Buddha answered my calling...Nhut Quang.  Also in a bit of an out of way location...but worth the travel.","85":"This place is terrible. The food is at BEST bland, and at worst just bad. The service is horrendous and unfriendly.\n\nI've been a few times for after-work drinks, for several meals, and for a couple Christmas parties my company had, and the appetizer type items are edible, if not amazing, but the main dishes have disappointing every time.\n\nOnce i had a pecan-crusted chicken salad that was so bland and badly done, that i wished I was at TGI Fridays instead having it, because there's is better. Way better.\n\nThe other day, i took my niece, sister and partner there.for lunch on a Monday about 1pm. It wasn't crowded at all, but the service was unfriendly, slow and just bad.  It took ages for them to even wipe of our table, a while to get our orders in, and the waitresses demeanor was just surly and she acted like this was the last place she wanted to be. Sorry if you're having a bad day, honey, but your JOB is to be friendly and helpful and -- you know SERVE.\n\nI had the fried pickles and chicken sliders. The pickles were OK, but came with no sauce, which i had to ask for. it was eventually plunked down rather attitudinally.  The chicken sliders were tasteless with no flavor in the coating of the chicken, no discernable sauce, limp iceberg lettuce and mealy tomatoes. Utterly gross.\n\nMy sister's lobster mac and cheese was edible, but not very well done, with gritty cheese sauce. (This IS a hard dish to do well, but their version is on the low end of the ones I've had at other places.)\n\nMy partner's fish and chips was a TINY piece of fish dwarfed against the mess of fries under it. It looked more like a fried goldfish. He wasn't happy. \n\nMy niece seemed happy with her burger, but she's 13 and it's a burger. \n\nOh, and my iced tea was lipton flavored tea. Who can't be bothered to make fresh  brewed iced tea?  Even Friday's does that. Ick.\n\nAll in all, bland, badly done meal served with an utter lack of professionalism or friendliness.  \n\nI'm not going back again.","86":"Went here yesterday and had a blast. The only reason I'd rather go do stand up paddle boarding in Lady bird lake is because there are no boats allowed therefore you dont have all the waves to knock you off the board and deal with. Other than that thoug, these guys were professional, nice, polite, and NOTHING like these other reviews I've been reading. I used 2 groupons and everything went off without a hitch yesterday. I'll be back for sure from time to time. Boats and all....","87":"I dropped my lawnmower off over a week and half ago to have the choke looked at and blades sharpened.  After a week I had not heard back from them so gave them a call.  I heard them talking about my mower, arguing over who had forgotten to order the parts.  They said they would call me back.  A few days later I get a call saying the mower is ready.  I get there to have them stick me with a $200 bill for a $50 part!  Aside from being outrageously expensive, how about a courtesy call once the problem is diagnosed?  No quote or estimate was EVER given.  When a gorgeous new mower is $200-400, why would I want to pay that kind of money to fix an older model?  Their customer service, for lack of a better term, SUCKS......as does their pricing.  I am not even upset at the cost, I am upset at the fact no courtesy call was given.  Oh yeah, as per the last review, do not expect to get a second look by the employees as they all sit around on personal calls on their cellphones.","88":"I'm bummed.  I really wanted to like this place.  It was actually recommended to me by a friend who used to work there, so I was really surprised when the following happened:\n\nI adopted my kitten from the humane society.  Went to Rose City and they told me my Felidae Cat and Kitten Formula did not have enough protein for a kitten.  Okay, so I switch to the Wellness diet.  Great.  Except my kitten starts pooping all over the apartment in little puddles.  I call them and instead of telling me to switch food they give me probiotics (the kitty equivalent of yogurt) about $20.  I use that, still having poo puddles to clean up every day.  Then I call again and stress that I really think it's the food.  They give me antibiotics ($40) and after several phone calls and insisting that they make another food recommendation, I leave with antibiotics and very expensive (and frankly kinda crappy and carb-laden) Intestinal food.  I call again later because now she's pooping in the litter, but still having loose stools.  All this time it is very hard to get someone on the phone.  Don't even bother leaving a message on the machine (which you might get during business hours)-- they don't even call the next day.  After keeping her on this food for a while, she develops hairball issues (probably because of the starches).  Finally today I call again and am just like \"guys this is not working\" and the woman on the phone tells me I should have just kept her on Felidae (which is actually a really great food).  \n\nAll in all, I wasted tons of time, put my cat through unnecessary stress, and spent over $100 between all the wasted food and unnecessary pro-biotics and antibiotics.  To top it off, I can't self-feed my cat anymore.  The only way I could get her to eat the food with antibiotics was to feed her small amounts at a time, so now she wants food all the time and always cleans her bowl.  \n\nThis was a simple problem.  They just assumed I was some overbearing cat owner instead of listening to my concerns about the food.  \n\nBummer.  The cookies were really good.","89":"This place has amazing food. The burgers are always so flavorful. And don't even get me started on the fries. I really love it because they have chicken burgers which at least make me feel like I'm eating healthy even if it's still smothered in cheese. I rate the location so poorly because on a Saturday at 2 pm it has taken 45 minutes to receive my food. I understand that they are full (no tables available) but for that wait I should have been warned before ordering! No one has come to acknowledge the poor service or apologize for the extreme wait. Fast casual isn't so fast anymore. Thoroughly disappointed since the food is so tasty. Make sure you visit when they're dead!","90":"Yum and yay, real Italian tratorria fare in Midtown!  And golly gosh, the owner is Italian, and from Italy no less.  Watch the crowds on Fox event nights as the restaurant gets way over crowded.   I like to sit at the bar here and order the Caesar salad and a pizza.  No you cannot share!","91":"Not happy at all! Over promised about time and some technicians are not proficient. Said wait time is 10 minutes but an hour later still no-one was available. I spent 3 hours and $90 including tip there to get mani and pedicure done. My nail application is not even and large gap between cuticle and polish. Staff is friendly but in the end of day, I want a good service. Not going back!","92":"Very good breakfast and plenty of food. Their Biscuits and Gravy is pretty good, but I would like it better if it was sausage based versus hamburger based.  If it was a Sausage Gravy over a Hamburger Gravy, it would earn 5 Stars. \n\n I like their Corn Beef Hash and eggs. It's canned, but I actually prefer that over the homemade kind. They cook it on the griddle perfectly so it has a nice crisp texture on the outside. \n\nThe French Toast was pretty good too.","93":"Great little bar. 14 of us from out of town stopped by for a drink. The service was very good.  Accommodated our big party with a few tables outside on a gorgeous day. Food was decent bar food.  Most of us got the steak bomb.  It was good portion and fairly tasty. Some including myself got the Peter Pan burger which had peanut butter and bacon.  It was ok. Nothing like the peanut butter burger from Yo Mama burger in New Orleans.  All sandwiches came with chips, a little slaw and pickles.  Reasonable price. Best, and what took it to 3 stars is the server, Chris.  Good time.","94":"I walked in looking like a caveman and walked out feeling 100% better. Rosa did an amazing job with my eyebrows and Snow made my nails look great! \nVery happy with my experience. I will definitely be coming back!","95":"This place is absolutely trash. The only reason I'm not giving this place one star is because the delivery driver tried really hard to find the dorm I was staying at. Reviews for the pizzas seemed average or above average, so I ordered a two topping veggie pizza. It arrived cold, soggy, the crust was very undercooked in some spots, and there was no edge on the crust despite the fact that it was not labeled as a thin crust pizza, nor do I believe that was the intended form of crust. \n\nI have no idea why my pizza was well below average quality, especially compared to the other generous reviews. Will never be returning here again.","96":"First off, the woman working there was very rude and seemed like she hated life. Second, my sandwich tasted good until i found not one but two hairs! So clearly they are not wearing hair nets. Not to mention my friend was eating a Cesar salad and then she found a SPIDER crawling around in her bowl. Definitely will not be eating hear again.","97":"I went here on the Saturday night of the Valentine Day's weekend. It was jam packed! When we arrived, we were fortunate enough that a table was open for our party of seven. As a side note, they do take reservations, so if you have a big party, make one!\n\nAs other yelpers have said, they have an extensive menu ranging from Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese cuisine, so be prepared when you order. I have gotten to-go foods with them before, so I was experienced with their options. \n\nSince the pho was heavily recommended, I ordered a small P5, which was the Pho with brisket and fat brisket. My other friends ordered both the red and yellow curries, chicken fried rice, egg noodle with wonton, and beef flat noodle. Each of the curries came with little more than a bowl of rice.  All of the dishes were hearty enough that we were all full by the end of our meal. \n\nThe pho was quite delicious. They give you a generous portion of meats, so much that I had more meat than noodles left in the end. The fat brisket was indeed fatty, so if that not your think you should order the flank steak. The broth was tasty, and not too salty. It soothed my sore throat.\n\nI also got to try one of their coconut curries. It had just a hit if sweetness, so I'll be ordering that the next time I come! My other friend said that the wontons were okay and that she had better ones elsewhere. Therefore, I recommend getting the Pho or curries. Previously, I had tried the crispy pad thai. The noodles are quite crunchy, so if you know that your teeth are slightly delicate, get the non-fried noodles instead.  \n\nAs a side note, we waited about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, so be prepared to have enlightening conversations with your peers. However, service was great. Waiters were always milling around to fill up your drinks. Plus, they split checks here, so that's another plus!","98":"Yet another disappointment has my temporary amnesia made me forget about all the other unsatisfactory experiences I have had at the Sonic\n\nThe sad thing is that the owners of all the Austin Sonic locations clearly have no clue of managing their staff and apparently no interest in even responding to issues that are posed over and over On Yelp\n\nIt is not just this one locations\n\nJust search on Yelp for all the Sonic reviews and you won't find a single one in the entire Central Texas area that Garners more than an average 2 star rating\n\nThis is not a reflection on the employees but the brain-dead ownership who seems to think they can just throw money at an installation and collect whatever shows up in the cash register without any semblance of oversight are direction to their staff\n\nSuch a shame as the Sonic template should certainly be a success story but for me I am done with Sonic and don't plan on ever spending any of my dollars again to a company with so little disregard to all of the issues that Yelp reviewers host \n\nFrankly I will cheer if the entire Austin Sonic organization goes bankrupt because they do not deserve to serve the general public with a total disregard for customer service and employee oversight\n\nMy last experience was similar to previous ones where I waited at the drive-thru Lane for a good 15 minutes while the employees in side screwed around with their thumbs up their ass while there were only two cars in the parking stalls and one in the drive-thru Lane\n\nThe ordering speaker was unusable because one Young employee was sitting in his car just next to it with his stereo blaring at about 100 decibels\n\nFrankly I hope this place Burns to the ground and I will cheer when that happens\n\nSonic RIP","99":"I'm not trying to be a hater, but my slice of rhubarb pie was really nothing to write home about. I've never had a canned strawberry rhubarb pie filling, but I would imagine the experience to be relatively similar to this ostensibly made from scratch slice. It was heavy on the sugar, light on the rhubarb and strawberry with a crust that was more crumbly than flaky. Also, steer clear of the coffee; my americano was like a watery version of a Burger King cup of joe. The experience was far from worth the nearly $10 it cost.","100":"This is THE place to go if looking for an ice cream cake! I had their adorable 'castle' cake for my sons birthday and believe me it was worth the extra $10 to get this than a regular cake, everyone loved it! Thanks daily scoop for making his party a success!!","101":"We chose loops based on reputation and its kid friendliness.  It did not disappoint.  The flat bread for my gyro was soft and chewy, the chicken was tender and juicy and the hotziki, was a nice touch.\n\nThe kids were both fans of their hotdogs and fries.  \n\nMy wife and I split an order of fetafire fries which we both thought were great accompaniments to the gyros.\n\nI would gladly return.","102":"I came on a Saturday during lunch time. The restaurant had a funky musky smell. The selection and quality was okay. Nothing stood out and impressed me. Price was typical of sushi restaurant. Unlikely to return.","103":"Used to be a big fan of this place but I'm done with it. As others have pointed out, the things that have always been not-so-hot about Koon Bo have reached new lows. Service has gotten really bad, super slow and forgetful. Plus the food has just gone too far with being cheaply done. $15 to $18 plate, say, beef with pickled vegetables has about 5 small slices of meat in it. Like it was a $5 lunch special over rice. Same with other dishes. Still fairly tasty but of course the balance of the dish is thrown right off when one flavour is pretty much missing.\n\nWorst of all, got about 9 smallish prawns per pound we ordered. 9 large prawns I could see (barely, maybe) but this was insane. Looked like half what it was supposed to be. So someone needs to check the scale.","104":"This is a new find in Vancouver for me, but not for other people because there was a crazy line out the door. Almost as soon as I was in line, a woman walked up to be and started attacking me for information. \n\n\"What do they serve here? Have you eaten here before? What is that man carving? Why are there so many people?\" \n\nWhile I tried to answer her questions as calmly and honestly as I could (you do not want to further rile up a confused and possibly hungry woman), I watched the other customers and the employees inside.\n\nIt was very quickly clear that this dedicated staff knew exactly what they were doing. Chop up the porchetta, add the salsa verde, top with crunchy porchetta-roll skin, and pass on down the line. With a dabble of mustard on the side and Fentiman's Curiosity Cola, the whole thing was yummy and salty (my favorite combination).","105":"I haven't dined in, but I ordered some food from Punjab Palace.\n\nThe food was delivered very hot and very fast--both good things.  However, the quality of the food is not what I was expecting.  Nothing had very much flavor, and there were a lot of bright, unnatural, colors.  I ate the food and it was alright with the pickle that came along with it...but my husband declined to eat anything even though he was hungry.  It was, shall we say, rather unappetizing though perfectly OK.","106":"I went to this awesome deli about a week ago, it was very tasty, and good prices. Best part, I loved that they also serve beer and wine, sometimes hard to find in a deli. I met the owner during my visit, I asked him if we was while he was training a new employee. He was very personable, and you could tell he lives for his work. He was getting his hands dirty going around pre-bussing. Also his wife makes the best carrot cake I've ever tried. \nGreat costumer service!\nGreat management! \nGreat place! \nI'd recommend this place to friends, family, and people who're visiting Austin.","107":"Far More Less than GREAT!!\n\nI have en-suite laundry in my apartment, and this was my second horrible experience at their establishment.  DON'T DO IT!\n\nThe woman was rude, and the place was NOT clean.\n\nHowever, they seem to maintain clients that are too damned lazy to do it for themselves, or -  to hire a quality housekeeper.\n\nI bought an expensive 'silk duvet' that I wanted to have washed before it was placed into a lovely duvet-cover that I had purchased at Duxiana.\nThey sell quality, and beuatiful things!\n\nMy washing machine just isn't large enough for a \"Queen-sized\" duvet.\n\nMany of the machines at \"Great Coin\" do NOT work, and I was NOT about to go, and leave this expensive silk duvet unattended.\nI sat and personally watched as many clients came in, and complained about many issues.\n\nHer \"Magesty\"' made useless comments that were - NONSENSE.\n\nIn my mind - I find this place to be the home of 'money-grubbing' wankers.","108":"This place is good for someone who is not looking for authentic ramen and doesn't know the difference. We ordered the chefs special - the broth was clear and unflavoured. The noodles looked like they came out of a prepackaged instant noodles. When we asked for sauce for the soup like the once you put in at any ramen place they looked at us and said oh you want mayo? Haha ... no not mayo .. we want chilli sauce for the ramen, which they didn't have. \nWe also ordered the Kara-ge chicken - it was literally chunks of chicken fat deep fried. No bueno. \n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if you are looking for authentic ramen this is not your place.","109":"If you like Velveeta, chips from a bag, taco shells from a box, tamales that taste like they came out of a can, and salsa made from canned tomato sauce, then this place is fantastic.","110":"The only reason for the full two stars is that I left before the end of the evening with my group.\nWe went here after the JP Morgan Corporate Challenge to grab a beer and some apps. It wasn't 100% packed when we went in and we actually sat at two tables separate from each other.\nThe waitress came right over and took our drink order and the beer came pretty fast. But then it became a challenge to get a food order in and when one of our party wanted to pay for his single beer so he could head home, the waitress was openly critical of the fact that she couldn't understand him. (He is from Norway and I do have to listen to him carefully sometimes to catch what he's saying, but, she didn't even bother)\n\"What?...I don't even know what you are talking about...I don't know what's going on here.\" Then walked away. \nWow. Can you imagine if you were in there with a family member who had a speech impediment or something that would require someone to take a minute to really listen and figure what's going on, and the waitress was that blatant about not giving a shit? Is that how you should approach a situation that is difficult? Just throw up your hands and walk away?\nThe food took a very long time to come to the table (she blamed it on a big party) I think they just didn't prepare for night when 12,000 people descended on the Boston Common and dispersed throughout to hit up local businesses for wares.\nI could say it was the crowd, again the corporate challenge just ended. I could say that it was the din of the crowd in the place (it was pretty loud in there) but in this case, (and from what happened to the group who finally settled up-the waitress wouldn't take cash and credit for the bill) I think it was the waitress.","111":"I chose this rating because it says I've exerienced better. I experienced better at the Continental. The last time I was there was about 18 years ago. I had wanted to return for many years as I have fond memories of this restaurant. While I was pleasantly surprised to see that some things had not changed, the meal went terribly wrong. There was a mishap with our tray of food and my husband's prime rib ended up on the floor. The other plates slid into each other, knocking peas into a schrod dinner, sweet potatoes into the peas, a bit of a messy serving. The mishap was not brought to our attention and the messy plates were served to us. Another prime rib was served to my husband shortly after on the same plate that had tipped! He knew this because there were sweet potato remnants on his plate under his new prime rib. I did ask our waitress about it and she confirmed that the kitchen was busy and that since his plate did not fall on the floor she put a new dinner on it.\nIt was Easter, it was busy but Really?","112":"Pretty tasty appetizers for a chain restaurant...not much more than that.\n\nWe went this past weekend, walking through snow and sleet to do some shopping.  When we go to Haru it was just past lunch and we sat in the bar area.  \n\nI loved the Agedashi Tofu which was crispy on the outside, soft and tasty tofu goodness on the inside -- great flavors and texture.  I recommend it for the vegetarians and meat eaters alike.  We also ordered the King Crab dumplings.  I had issues with this dish only because it needed some type of sauce to go with the meaty and very filled crab dumplings.  It was...a little dry and the sauce provided with the dish didn't pair well in my opinion.  I found the sort of vinegar \/\/ soy dipping sauce too pungent for delicate crab.  For sushi we had the crunchy spicy tuna roll which was ehhh nothing special.  It tasted good enough, but I didn't find it super flavorful or anything really special so we decided to order more of the Agedashi Tofu.  Coupled with a couple of Harutini which was a strange sort of pink -- think a cross between pepto bismol and cotton candy and you get the color.  I liked the taste because, despite the color it was not an overly sweet drink.  In fact the sake really mellowed out the vodka.  \n\nNow the service -- the problem with the service is that a football game was playing when we decided to stop in, so over the course of our meal we received service from the bartender and the hostess and overheard some dude talk about being our waiter although we never saw him.  Needless to say the service was inconsistent and a bit disappointing.  We waited quite a while from when we placed our initial order for drinks and food to when the food arrived to when someone came to check on us to when we ordered more food and drinks to eventually when we had the table cleared and got the check.  I hold this against Haru since the place was not packed and in my mind we should have had much more attentive and consistent service.","113":"What a find! If you are looking for an inexpensive day of pampering this is the place for you. I have been looking for a place like this because they have many in Houston. I think I have found it.","114":"Our pizza was burnt, they were very skimpy on the toppings and the guy on the phone was rude. Spend your hard earned cash some where else. Not what we expected!!!","115":"Celeste and Yona were incredible in providing my bridesmaids, mother, grandmother, mother-in-law and myself in exactly what we were looking for to make us feel beautiful on my wedding day. I cannot recommend their services enough! Everyone was ecstatic with how amazing Celeste did their hair, and how Yona did wonders with our make-up! They are both truly artists. No need to worry with these two amazing ladies working with you!","116":"I was checking out kids' play area on yelp around me and this one popped up, the play area looked beautiful so I took my then 10 months old here. You need to take off your shoes before entering the play area, which I really liked. You pay the amount for 2 hours play time and stick the given slip on your kids' back or anywhere on clothes. It basically let you know the time limit. \nI found the play area a little dirty. There were lots of strands of hair and spilled crumbs of food along with dirt. Some of the toys were really dirty. Other than that, there were nice interactive things. My daughter had a good time, so that meant a lot to me.\nI would have appreciated if it was kept clean with some more toys for infants.","117":"Terrible experience. Went in, waited 2 hours (was third), had bronchial infection, knew I needed antibiotics, got terrible PA, Speltz, who was arrogant, condescending and he made derogatory remarks because I first sought natural remedies (as even my Pharmacist daughter recommends), lectured me because I do not believe in flu shots (which have been proven useless, and even harmful), insisted I do a nebulizer treatment in the office, even though I refused due to the steroids (which is my choice). Because I had the audacity to refuse, he stated, \"Well then, I won't give you  zpac antibiotics unless you do the nebulizer.\"  So I walked out.\nNow, I know that there are many, many Medicare scams that go on. This nebulizer is a money-making treatment. I'm 62 years old and have NEVER been told anything about a nebulizer before, and I'm certainly old enough to know my body and when it cannot fight a bacterial infection and needs antibiotics. I don't like being treated like a child and certainly not talked down to by a PA. HE did not check my ears, my glands, my throat, which is standard procedure. He did, however listen to my lungs and even made mention of hearing possible pneumonia. I do my research on medical situations and recommend everyone do the same. These PA's are brainwashed and sometimes morons. Like this one was. Even after I called patient relations, they took their time getting back to me (I had to leave two messages), and after speaking to a representative, who was nice and agreeable to my situation, I never heard back. I would not recommend Memorial Urgent care. I would not even give it one star, if I could help it.\nRobin Hall","118":"I've been back to Opera a few times up in VIP. \n\nI guess its a little less crowded up there, but still crowded. I certainly wouldn't pay for it, but it is better than the floor - easier to get a drink.\n\nStill not my scene, but I'd say VIP actually gave me the 3 star experience I thought Opera would in my original review","119":"We have lived in Mt Dora for three years and finally decided to try Palm Tree Grille because we were told the menu had changed. I am glad to say that we have not missed out on a great restuarant... The \"crusty\" waitress didn't give us a wine or beer menu. She also gave me flat \"No\" when I asked if they had any Vegetarian options other than fried cheese or pasta and gave no recommendations or promises of checking with Chef for special requests . When I presented her with my $25 off restaurant.com gift certificate, she was quick  to show her disdain. She came back in record speed to tell me that thw owners stopped taking them six months ago. We normally tip 25% on our entire bill including wine. It was a struggle giving 15% tonight. I support our local business because I love my town but I cannot recommend Palm Tree. Locals and Tourists go elsewhere for better food, atmosphere And SERVICE.","120":"Just stopped in for a late lunch and it was pretty much what I expected.  Very fresh, very expensive, but very good.  I stuffed my face so I don't know how \"healthy\" my intake was but if you eat normal quantities, you can still pat yourself on the back.\nSuper friendly staff who will offer you coconut cake samples (you heard me) and chat it up for a bit.  \nI didn't know what to make of this place at first.  Think of it more as a take home deli.  They have meals prepared (and a great little meat section too) and packaged food as well.  An array of drinks and even a daily featured cookie.\nI got the portabello mushroom wrap, a side of jalepeno hummus, and a gluten-free chocolate chip cookie.  The wrap was okay.  Kind of vinegary for my taste but I think if I had toasted it, I would have enjoyed it more.  The hummus was great.  Not as spicy as I originally thought, but I'm not dinging them for that.  And the cookie was delicious!  Dairy free, too.  \nTheir other desserts looked awesome...they'd be even tastier in sample form...","121":"Well, I didn't actually buy a bike here, but I went and test rode one! They were super friendly and helpful. While I tried to haggle the price of a used bike they stood their ground! I respect that, man. Anyway it was a great bike and I appreciate their helpfulness and friendly nature. I've also heard great things about this place from others. Woo!","122":"I would never stay at this location again. The room was not clean the bedding seemed clean but not the rest of the room. The bathroom was disgusting, and it is more upsetting that during Covid time when customers are being reassured that extra measures are being taken, it was obvious they are NOT!\n\nThe toilet had pee on it, there was sticky stuff on the floor, the shower had residue and grime in it, the microwave had food burnt in the plate. I reported this to the front desk and the \"Housekeeping Manager\" cleaned it - he\/she tools a single wipe and wiped the dried pee off the seat. I finished the job myself - this was the last room on the first floor and with our other vacation arrangements we really didn't have time to change hotels. I bought some alcohol and sprayed the entire room for extra measure. \n\nThe final disappointment - Hilton Corp or this location never offered any customer service. Nothing has been done for mine and my daughters experience at this location. I will never stay at a Hilton - and I will encourage others to stay away as well.","123":"If you're looking for a fantastic gourmet burger, this is the place. However, I'd recommend getting it to go. It's loud. Very very loud. Inside, is loud enough that it's very difficult to have a conversation. The sound reverbs off-the-wall even when there's only a few people inside. Outside, if there's more than 10 people you can forget having any conversation with the rest of your party. Patrons preferred to yell over each other in the yellow over other tables next to them. This is likely due to the way they have the outdoor seating screened in, which is nice because it keeps the breeze down, but you can't have a conversation. As for the food, the burgers are amazing. I can't say that enough. The fries are delicious and skinny, crunchy, and well worth getting them as a side. The onion rings, have almost no flavor whatsoever. You would think with a batter there would be some type of saltiness or deep flavor, but that's just not the case. Get a sauce if you get the rings. Service is phenomenal. They even will refill your cup even though beverages are self-service.","124":"BBQ pork and dumplings were delicious but the marinated chicken was a bit fatty and just tasted\u200blike soy sauce. Waa good enough to try a second time. We shall see.........","125":"Diamond Nails left a very good impression on me. They offer a wide variety of services, including the dipping powder manicure which I personally prefer over shellac. They also give a FANTASTIC back and arm massage. Whenever I arrived they immediately sat me down and offered me a choice of water, sodas, & wine. All in all I had a great experience and I will for sure be returning.","126":"B E W A R E ! ZERO stars! Long's broke our deck railing and would not pay for the damage\/repair. Nick, the owner said he didn't want to incur the cost of his $500.00 deductible. The repair is in excess of $10,000.00. DO NOT do business with these low-lifes (and I'm not just talking about how they look). They break screens and aren't very good at washing windows either. B E W A R E !","127":"Often busy, but always efficient. Great staff with with a friendly demeanor. Drink is always made right and with a smile. Beautiful building. Only complaint is the bathrooms-they tend to be pretty gross.","128":"Very disappointed. \nI waited to be seated for 30 minutes, but that wasn't that big of a deal. However, i didn't realize that i would have to wait for an hour for my fried chicken after that. I asked the server about the sauce on the chicken, if I could get extra( if it is extra charge i will pay too). She said they cannot give extra sauce, but it will be enough sauce to cover the chicken like a glaze. \nSo, as I expected, the chicken came out dry.. not enough sauce on the chicken. I think they are far from ready to open.","129":"Roscoe's has become one of my favorite spots to drink beer in town.  If you haven't been here in awhile, give it another shot -- it has changed.\n\nFirst, the beer list has been terrific.  16 taps of tasty and unique goodness, a few very difficult to find elsewhere.  On a recent visit, I enjoyed Fort George's Omegatex triple IPA... I doubt many kegs made it outside of Astoria.  Rarities aside, the beer list is usually nicely balanced, with a little something for everyone.  Best of all, they seem to pour $4 pints of just about anything -- even a 10%+ triple IPA that would certainly be in a 10-ounce snifter anywhere else!  \n\nInstead of your typical pub grub, Roscoe's offers food with a cajun flair.  Sure you can get a burger or tots, but you can also get jambalaya and various po' boys.  I've eaten here a few times (since they recently changed the menu), and its always been quite good. \n\nService is laid back, but very friendly.  They always seem willing to pour a taster and have been patient throughout my indecisiveness.\n\nA few pool tables, internet jukebox, full bar... there is something for everyone here.. well, except a patio for the smokers.  4 stars instead of 5 because there is still some room for improvement.  The 82nd Ave crowd can be sorta sketchy, but that is changing as people realize that this place has become much more than a typical dive.\n\nCheck it out.. you can always run away to The Observatory or The Country Cat if Roscoe's is too grungy for you!","130":"Twice I have come at around 5:30 to get dinner for the family only to be told it will be a 10 minute wait because chicken is not ready.  What!!!!!!  This is a chicken place.  You should be prepared for people coming to get chicken for dinner.  So Popeye's it was and I never realized Popeye's chicken tenders were so good.  Got a couple of $5.00 big boxes which was  a real bargain.  So thanks Chicken Express for being out of chicken.","131":"Benihana Austin - \nHow do I love thee\nLet me count the ways - Ok done - none\nHave been to others around the country and while the tables look the same -- the knives twirls and spin, the chef shows a toothy smile and tries the same humor -- it just doesn't go over as well for me here.\nMaybe because the food tasted bland -- maybe the novelty has worn off -- maybe I wasn't drunk enough \nWhatever -- I quit going because Benni baby -- You just don't ring my bell any more.","132":"James from seafood had so much patience with his customers. He was willing to go out of his way to make sure that we get all of the seafood on our list. I usually don't find this good of an experience anywhere else. I will definitely come back to Fiesta!","133":"We were craving some fried fish, and stumbled upon this spot. Overall, the food was decent, nothing GREAT, or to rave about. I ordered the fish and chips, and went with the cod. It comes with 8, 1 inch pieces and fries. I went with half Chile flavored and half lightly battered. The Chile flavored was absolutely amazing, didn't need any dipping sauce. The lightly battered was a bit plain.\n\n My wife ordered the Pacific salmon, which comes with quinoa and a side, she got the Thai  Cole slaw. The cole slaw was pretty bland and boring, a total fail.\n\nOverall, would we come back for a future visit, nah!! They get a three for the Chile flavored, the good drinks and better service.","134":"Stopped in the other day with my husband and ordered 2 asada tacos, 1 lengua and 1 chicken taco.\nThe portions are nice.  They have an amazing salsa bar with salsa, pickled veggies, fresh radish and fresh cucumber. \nThe asada was a bit tough.\nThe lengua was under seasoned. \nThe chicken was a bit dry.\nOverall, I'm willing to visit again and try something new.  They have a good sized menu.  Staff was kind of blah, but they were busy.","135":"Stopped here for the first time on the way to a Bruins game on New Year's Eve to use my Phantom Gourmet gift card. Loved it! Everyone was very friendly, especially our waitress. The restaurant was cozy and warm. Service was quick. Loved the warm bread with oil. I had the meatloaf and my 17 year old daughter had the grilled chicken caesar wrap. Both were very good and filling. We had absolutely no complaints. I plan to come back with friends. To recommend it further to me, my Dad walked in. What a surprise since we had just stopped by his house before coming here! It was his birthday and he was meeting up with my Stepmom. He told me it is one of his favorite restaurants in the Boston area and he loves to take out of town visitors here. He said he has been coming here for years and has never had a bad meal here.","136":"Great start for a new Atlanta addition.  Original locations in Athens and now moving into our city.  This promises to be a great new option.  Wonderful seafood dishes, especially oysters in their many forms.  Brunch option that is badly needed in this area.  This place will grow into its new home and get much better soon.","137":"One of my favorite restaurants. Wonderful staff and great service! Food very good and better than some restaurants in Italy.","138":"I came here for a rehearsal dinner of a wedding that I was thankfully in, and thankful it wasn't my own. Anyhow, the food was a set menu but it was great all the same. It's a classy joint, so don't go wearing your Naots that you haven't washed since 93'...\n\nEnjoy Suckas'!!!","139":"Always really friendly and delicious good southern style breakfast choices. Within walking distance of our house so a special treat after we go to the park.","140":"Dinner before leaving for the airport. Terrific atmosphere-calm, efficient, attuned service. Delicious food with creative flare that inspires return visits to sample more of their offerings. Kalua pig is the standard for my husband. I enjoyed the scallops with red curry & noodles.  Next time we'll be sure to try the pumpkin chocolate cheese cake.\nA bonus-easy freeway access made getting to PDX a breeze.","141":"I've been shopping at T&T for years and was always very pleased withe their products. However, I had such a bad experience with a couple of their store brand items recently that I have to write this review.\nThe items were T&T Bakery Red Bean with Yolk moon cake and Lotus Seed with Yolk Moon Cake. Quite honestly, they gotta be the worst moon cakes I've ever tasted ! The Lotus seed paste and the red bean paste are extremely dry, sorely lacking the smooth texture you find in a well made moon cake.  And the yolks were almost an after-thought, they were lumpy and way over cooked. If I have to grade those moon cakes, they deserve nothing but 'F's. \nFrankly, I am very shocked with those poorly made products bearing T&T brand names. A couple of months ago during their Dragon Boat Festival promotion, I bought a few of their  sticky rice wraps and they were out of this world good. Thinking about them make me yearning for them. Sigh...","142":"Ooooohhh, A new and exciting eatery in JP's dynamic Hyde Square neighborhood. Service was great, and the whole place seemed warm and inviting. Lots of fresh tasting ingredients and seafood. Good selection of alcohol. Yum. Bon appetit!","143":"The bartender told me there is a $20 minimum AFTER she mixed my drink and took my card. When I asked for some tap water she told me she can give me a $5 water bottle but her manager wouldn't allow her to give people tap water. This is ridiculous bc they're making you spend $20 on drinks while you dance and don't care to keep you hydrated.","144":"Avoid this financing business. We were going to replace our windows with Anderson. However, due to the unpleasant experience with the representative of this company, we asked them to leave our home. We went with Pella instead. Horrid customer service and Anderson should rethink using them as an option to finance their windows.","145":"I figured I would check this place out after hearing about it on MvF, but apparently a million other people had decided to do the same thing that evening.  After an hour wait we got seated and went for the New England Clam Bake with a 3lb lobster.  The clam chowdah, slaw, and corn on the cob were an excellent precursor to the main event.  The clams were fresh...perhaps a little too fresh because all I tasted was sand.  The lobster, however, was delicious and tasted like it was cooked right out of the harbor; we destroyed that mofo in no time.  \n\nOn a side note, these guys must sprinkle diamonds on their seafood because I've never had to pay so much for lobster before.  I thought the price per lb in boston would be a a little lower than the west coast rates since it's closer to the source, but I didn't take \"tourist inflation\" into account.\n\nOverall, a good place to eat with a lively atmosphere and ok service.  The clam bake is perfect for two, but the lobster alone will provide satisfaction.","146":"This place is fantastic. It was instantly my favorite place once my food came out. The presentation is immaculate and the food itself superb. The selection is great, and they don't mess around with fake meats. Everything is prepared from scratch by chef Bob Bouley who really outdoes himself with each dish. The food comes quickly and the price is very reasonable.\n\nThe location isn't the greatest, but I think that's ok. It'll allow Vej Naturals to really hone their craft before moving things to Cambridge or Boston.\n\nI'm going back often!","147":"AWESOME PLACE excellent food and a great location. They have a good beer list and the best raw oysters I've ever had. The views are nice and the staff is friendly. It seems to be the place to go in Salem so plan ahead if you're going on the weekend.","148":"Deeply disappointing experience. Quoted a car via email and confirmed it was in stock (Civic touring). Website showed they had 19 of these cars in various colors. After two hours at the dealership, they claimed that the car I was quoted was sold that morning and that they'd need to launch a search for the model I wanted at an additional cost of $46\/month (i.e. $1656 over three years). Utter waste of time and highly unprofessional. \n\nWon't recommend to anyone","149":"The quality of this place has dropped dramatically. Dirty and sticky tables, broken chairs in the place, and a pretty inattentive staff has made this place a destination of desperation. \n\nI ordered the Szechuan chicken and there was nothing spicy about it. Average overcooked chicken with a smidget of broccoli and slathered in some over-salted MSG infested sauce. They may have put a drop of Tabasco in to placate me but definitely what I would consider mild. Even green peppers would be spicier than this junk. My previous review mentioned mall food type but mall food would be insulted by these concoctions. I wouldn't be surprised if most of their food is straight-out-of-the-box pre-frozen hell that's panned off as original. Obviously it's time for this place to reinvent itself or close up shop. If you think this food is spicy, your palate is poorly underdeveloped and should take a trip to Buford Highway for some authentic cuisine that will burn the hair off your feet.\n\nAvoiding this place at all costs now unless zombies begin to attack and I'm desperate for food.","150":"DO NOT COME HERE. Horrible customer service experience. We put down $300 deposit with Kanita Biloglavic and Burton Broadstone. We came back 2 days later to pay for the rest of the car. The used-car manager sold the car, his name is Carlo Giovannucci. I emailed the General Manager Michael Martinez  to clear things up and I never receive an answer from any of them. DO NOT TRUST THIS DEALERSHIP. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE.","151":"Wish you to know we have been patients of Dr Valerie Hanft at Westlake Dermatology over several locations and a decade of positive professional experiences.\nThe good Doctor has proven herself proactive,attentive and caring in all interactions.\nWe commend her to you,knowing her as a prime example of the quality of staff at Westlake Dermatology\nWendy and Thom Woodruff","152":"A Legal Sea Foods in the airport is exactly what you'd expect a Legal Sea Foods in the airport to be like. Slightly overpriced but standard fare that tastes and served exactly the same as a Legal Sea Foods anywhere. \n\nMy husband and I each got a mug of the Clam Chowder and we also split the Greek Salad. Both were very good, and not unreasonably high priced for an airport location.\n\nThe bartender (we sat at the bar) was very friendly and checked in on us frequently even though we weren't ordering alcohol (and therefore he knew he wouldn't get a ton of money off of us). At other bars I've gone to, I've received a lower quality of service if I'm only ordering food. But this was not the case. \n\nNext time I'm in this area of Logan, I'd eat here again.","153":"La Taqueria may turn out delicious tacos, but alas my recent burrito experience was lackluster.  I tried the Tinga de Pollo, which was supposed to include black beans, chicken, cheese, salsa fresca, crema, and tortilla chips--all the components of a really hearty meal.  What I received was a burrito with no beans, tons of a kind of tomatoey salty rice, and crushed tortilla chips INSIDE the wrap (???).  Very strange, and inordinately salty.  For a $13.75 burrito, it's a bit disingenuous that they stuff it with primarily cheap ingredients (rice, tortilla chips) instead of more of the advertised chicken.  Also not sure why the beans were left out.\n\nOn the plus side, I did appreciate the complementary pickled red onions to cut some of the saltiness, and the homemade flour burrito wrap was notably fresh and tasty.  Also the counter staff are very friendly, and my meal came out quickly.\n\nIn terms of both taste and value, I would recommend sticking with the tacos.  Whole Foods just down the street has a better and cheaper made-to-order burrito experience.","154":"Great Thai food. I'm lucky to live a few blocks away!! Outstanding Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, wonderful soup...yummy thai iced tea. Good service and atmosphere as well. I would rate it best Thai in Portland. Yum.","155":"This is our first time at a heb and they had such a wide variety of food choices!! I purchased lemon pepper tilapia from the meat department and it was four fillets for $4! My fianc\u00e9 loved it, it was so tasty and easy to cook! We also enjoyed the variety of nuts they had. Each nut comes out of a dispenser and they have dried fruit. We made a nice size bag of nuts that would easily be $9-$12 at meijers, it was a little over $4 at HEB! The lines were moderate so did not wait too long. Overall great experience !","156":"I wanted to love them as my new mechanic, since I recently moved, and they have good ratings here and on Car Talk's web site.  They certainly were friendly and helpful, walking under the car with me to take a look, explaining procedures and options, but then they screwed me.\n\nI went in for an oil change.  They insisted I needed a 60k mile work-over.  Honda recommends this and they are Honda people, so that's fair.  However, I wish I'd had my coffee already at that point.  When I looked it up later I found out that not only is that unnecessary, but they overcharged me ($380).  Basically, they change some fluids that you can get changed when you notice poorer performance, put in new spark plugs probably prematurely, and look around for problems which they won't find that way.  It is a way for Honda to get money for its dealerships after the initial sale.  I base the overcharge claim on Googling what others have been charged, as well as checking with my old mechanic, who quoted me $200-250 depending on what they actually have to do.\n\nThey called me to say that my front breaks need to be redone and that it will cost a bit over $400 (420?).  They want to replace my pads and rotors with Honda parts, and this is going to take them two hours.  The reason it takes them so long to do something so quick is that they insist on truing the brand-new rotors, which is pretty ridiculous.  Can you imagine Honda assembly, truing each new rotor as it comes in from the factory?  They also planned to pull out the whole assembly to do some cleaning process which is apparently unique to them.  They claim my calipers are fine, so I don't know if they'll even take those apart to clean.  Guess who will - with a $300 break job including no BS - my old mechanic, who I'll be going back to even though it means driving back to Melrose (LBJ Honda, btw, great guys).","157":"Came here for Sunday brunch on December 10. While the menu looked great the food really wasn't. The deviled eggs were rubbery as if they had been sitting around a couple days. I did not care for the bacon as it was way too salty.  The biscuits we're not big and flaky more on the small side and a little hard.\n\nOur server was good but they were short staffed in the kitchen and by the looks of it everyone everyone in the restaurant had to wait quite a while for food. When our food came only two orders were brought to the table and mine was forgotten about.  \n\nOn a good note the mimosas were great. The best I have ever had!  And they discounted our check.","158":"This place is the reason people keep coming to our kid's birthday parties. The cake is wonderfully moist and dense, but not leaden. The buttercream is the antithesis to the horrible foamy topping placed on store bought cakes. We have tried to rotate through the cake flavors and they are all pretty tasty. The cupcakes have been a hit with the kids at the parties. You can also buy just a slice of cake to eat or even Macarons.","159":"I just received my credit card statement for my rental of a \"mid size\" car at the Orlando location last month. We originally rented a mid size car for the quote of $143.44. When we arrived at the location the night of our flight, all they had left were 15 passenger vans!!!!!!!!!!! The lady reassured us that we would ONLY be charged for the mid size rental. (no offer of a discount for the amount of money it cost us to FILL the behemoth!) As soon as we left the lot, my husband told me there was only 1\/4 of a tank of gas in it. The lady said to return it with 1\/4 tank of gas as well. When we returned the van, my husband shut it off, handed the keys to the kid that was there to check it off, grabbed the receipt and we jumped into the shuttle to get to the airport to make our flight back to NJ. At the time of the rental, we were charged an additional $200.00 as a deposit. When my statement came today, I was only credited $155.72. When I called Ace Rental, the lady said the kid marked that the van was on E when we returned it and we should have disputed it then and there. I told her we got gas and made SURE there was 1\/4 tank in it when we returned it, and she said there was nothing she could do. Do NOT use this company. They have some scam going! From them not holding our reservation (since they had no mid size car for us when we got there) to the oversized vehicle which cost us three times as much money for gas, than we budgeted for, to the outrageous keeping of our deposit which they claim was for gas, it wasn't worth the aggravation. We are now disputing the charge with our credit card company. What a rip off. We will NEVER use this company again!","160":"The good-I love the pool tables,drinks,and pull tabs. I really liked the steak bites I got with blue cheese and onions. I also liked my hot turkey sandwhich and the clam chowder.\n\nThe Bad-Service was lacking in customer service, I was ordering for my husband and I while he was playing pool with our friend. I ordered the Jake burger for my husband and the hot turkey sandwhich for me, and I was done ordering and she was trying to leave and I had to stop her and say \" I am not done ordering yet?\" She finally took all of my order and put that in, a while later I saw food in the window and then it sat there for 10 minutes......so I got up and asked a different waitress if that was my food and she was nice a d helpful and found out for me and it was my food then it was delivered to my table...\n    I ate a couple bites of the hot turkey and it wasn't hot, my mashed potatoes were cool,my steak bites were hot so was the clam chowder but my sandwhich was not hot, I took the sandwich to the front and talked to a different waitress and told her my food was cold and that it had sat in the window for 10 minutes she apologized for the other waitress which she shouldn't have it was her fault,it was the other waitresses fault for not doing her job. So the waitress I had talked to had my sandwich refired and I got a new hot sandwich and that was awesome!!!! I was really happy after that.\n\n By the end of our meal our bill came and I got up and went and paid it was the waitress who had my food refired and I gave her a tip and thanked her for refiring my food,and gave her a tip for the cook and asked her to tell him I said thank you for recooking my food, I could not bring myself to give our waitress a tip because of her trying to leave before I was done ordering and for leaving my food in the window for 10 minutes to get cold,her service was deplorable and she needs to learn some customer service so this is why I took two stars away. It is not because of the restaurant, but because of one waitress lacking in customer service.","161":"It's decent but not great.  The miso marinated cod is the best thing on the menu.","162":"The atmosphere reminds me a bit of Crema Cafe, or maybe Pavement Coffeehouse minus the funky seating options.\n\nI don't have the best of vision so I couldn't read the sandwich menu very well (note: I can't remember the last time I've ever had a problem reading a menu from afar). You think with that kind of menu they'd have a small handheld version to accommodate people with poor vision. Nope! So I didn't buy a sandwich. Their loss. I find this particularly odd because they have a menu online.\n\nI was the only one waiting for a drink yet my latte took forever. I've gotten faster service at cafes that were packed. It was really obvious the people behind the counter were smitten by apathy. I got the impression very, very early in they did not give a shit about giving me good service, and they did not give a shit about coffee in general. And usually I don't complain about that kind of stuff! Honest!\n\nThen I received my latte and holy cow. The \"barista\" didn't even make an attempt to pour it decently. Never mind the lack of art (which is definitely a red flag mind you); she accidentally poured too much milk so it ran a little over the edge before I even got it. The drink was a good temperature and the milk wasn't scorched but I attribute that more to luck than anything else. I feel like next time I go in I might get some scorching hot milk.\n\nI will be fair, though, the coffee they use is great. Intelligentsia's Black Cat. Overall my latte was actually pretty good but I don't trust their baristas enough to order many more in the future.\n\nThe sticky bun was respectable but not enough so to redeem my dismal service and lack of trust toward the baristas. Oh well.\n\nThey have WiFi with a pricing scheme that very deliberately caters to regular customers. Safe to say I won't be in that category.","163":"After dinner with friends on our first night in Portland , they said we had to try this place.  I wish I had known we were going there because I would've saved room to try a sundae.  Or a dipped cone.    Instead I got a cone of roasted strawberry coconut.     It was very good, with intense strawberry flavor (unfortunately, the coconut was barely noticeable after the first bite).   The cone itself just ok (Ruby Jewel's waffle cones are better).     The nice surprise was the serving size.  It was much more than I expected.   Someone else in our group got a sundae with cookie chunks and said they were amazing.","164":"From the horrible customer service to the rooms that are very dated, this was far from a relaxing stay and housekeeping that gives you attitude and we had a major issues at this resort.\n\nMGR here don`t care about you nor did they get the memo regarding client experience .","165":"I really want to give it more stars but I do have a few dislikes. First of all parking kinda sucks you have to pay $10 to park I didn't know that... it was crowded but we were seated fast which was a plus but it took our waitress almost 40 mins to take our order. A party of 4 was seated right beside us but it was too close for comfort. Which brings up the next bad part..... because this party was serious so closely to us in the end I gratuity was through the roof because they had us as a party of eight though there were only six people however they were a party of four and we were a party of two so The gratuity shouldn't have been grouped together that's when you know someone sitting too close. The food also took a really long time coming out and additional 30 minutes and it wasn't hot when it arrived. I know I'm listing a lot of complaints but the food was actually really good ambience was nice inside and I do like where the restaurant is located. Although there are things that I did not like about this visit I will give it a second chance in a month or so hopefully I'll have better things to say.","166":"This was our first time here, the place is quite spacious but is still nice and does not have the feel of a big box place. Nice decoration of animals\nAnd eggs and farms. waitress was very friendly and I like them at here you get a pot of coffee. we ordered a crepe and one benedict that both were really good. Also it is a good price for sure. This is going to be one of our favorite breakfast places going forward. Attached 3 pics","167":"I went to the Art Institute between 2001 to 2005, so my review maybe outdated. The school is a for profit school but with that say my experience was pretty good. The students and teachers were very nice, the place was clean most of the time. I got a BFA in Graphic Designer which was very useful for my first few jobs but after that it really comes down to your portfolio. Which is now has to be online.\n\nSome of the downside of the school is that it's really overprice but like most art schools, that's true for all. It was one of the most easiest schools to get into and SAT did not matter, if you were willing to get financial aid. That was one of the biggest problems with the school itself. Most of the students had no business being in the school. If you don't have the skills to design before getting in then having a degree will not help you when finding a job which was the main reason people when to the school.\n\nThe teachers were a hit or miss when you pick needed to take a class. If the teacher was good then the classes that they were teaching would always fill up. If the teacher was known to be easier the all the classes would fill up quickly too. Which was why when I had a good teacher, I would always pick that teacher when I needed a class that they were teaching but most teacher would stay for a year or so and leave.\n\nIf you  are good with design then Art Institute is an okay school to go to but if you have no clue on what you want to do or your not good at design then stay away from AI. They will tell you that you can learn to be a good graphic designer which is not true.\n\nTheir is a saying, \"If you don't like numbers then don't be an accounting.\"","168":"This is our go-to sushi restaurant in the neighbourhood. The portion sizes are big and the service is great. I highly recommend!","169":"I had a battery replaced here last year, and thought they were pretty good guys.  However, my battery died 4 times--for no reason--since then. When I had to get it replaced this week, the technician told me I had the wrong battery in my car.  The certified auto people put the wrong kind and size of battery in my car, and never let me know.\nBeware.","170":"Went there on a Saturday night with a 5 pm reservation for 6 people. We told the waitress from the beginning that we had a concert to get to that night so that is why we came early in the evening. Fast forward to 7:30 pm when we are searching the restaurant for our server so that we could get the bill from her.\nThe food was really great - the group ordered the lobster bisque, lobster fondue, the large cold tower (delicious), caesar salad, ravioli, brussel sprouts, lobster mac and cheese. Everything was great except for the brussel sprouts which were gross and $7.50 for a small bowl- we did tell the waitress that they were not good but she didn't deduct it from our bill (which was close to $300). I think they may need to work out a few kinks and make the service a little better and faster - but the food was good","171":"Shin Hakata is a few doors down from Pho Basil on Mass Ave. \n\nTheir soft opening menu basically offers everything from their normal menu minus the combo sets. Interior is surprisingly spacious and modern. \n\nOnly came here for their tonkotsu ramen as I am an avid fan. \n\n(-) Their broth is on the lighter end of the spectrum. It's not heavy or savory enough.  I will say though it is on the healthier side as it's not saturated in oil droplets. \n\n(+) a half egg is already included with their tonkotsu and miso ramen \n(+) half boiled egg was beautifully done- half cooked, half oozy \n(+) cha shiu is an excellent thick cut. Good meat to fat ratio.  \n\nIt's a decent brunch option if you're looking for something to eat around Prudential.","172":"This is the worst !!!\nMy order has never been made correctly. I have gone back every week or 2 since they have been open, to give them a chance to work all the kinks out,  but they just seem to get it right. I have never gotten my order made correctly yes NEVER .\nThe last time I went in I started sweating when I got near the register, I asked my friend to check to see if we could eat outside , he said yes ,so we stayed. While we were eating several people went in and left once they felt the heat. I went in again tonight because I want to support new restaraunts to open in the EAV and again the A C still wasnt working well. This is the last time for me I guess i just cant spend my money where I live.\nNever again.","173":"I really hope this place steps up their food game because it's a great location with amazingly attentive and friendly service. \n\nTaco Tuesday is a joke. How is $2.50 for a tiny taco a good deal? It comes with raw, shredded veggies and no sour cream or guac or pico or salsa! Nothing! Incredibly bland, we had to ask for hot sauce just to give it some flavor. \n\nThey don't even give you chips and salsa to start. $3!!! Chips and queso is $9!! Unbelievable. Salsa is very, very bland.","174":"This place is dope.  They give you like 6 different salsas with your chips.  Everything I have tried here has been great","175":"first no more healthy juices even though its on the menu board  behind the register and on printed paper menus second I had to use my own wet wipes to clean the booth I wanted to sit in both table and seat  in deplorable condition third the Cuban sandwich which was advertise as back by popular demand  was piss poor one single thin slice of ham one single thin  slice of roast pork for almost $9.00 served open faced they need to go back to the drawing board on that one how about travel to Cocoa Beach and try a Cuban from Roberto's","176":"It was our first time, was in the mood for sushi but didn't wanna deal with driving into Cbus. I had the veggie roll, which was fine, the veggies didn't seem that \"crisp\" to me tho. I still ate them and enjoyed adding soy sauce and wasabi. My beau had a soup, not sure what kind but very tasty. He ordered a specialty roll, Rainbow, I think, and said it was very good. I had the spicy Shrimp with garlic sauce and it was delicious. The veggies were very good and the sauce was a bit spicy but I really liked it. The shrimp were big too. After all the same ol' chain restaurants In Town, it's nice to have a decent, locally owned place to visit. We will definitely come back and try something else.","177":"I got my 3-month-old daughter's passport photo done here. \n\nPro: Quick in and out. \n\nCon: I went to a real photography studio thinking I'd get a better photograph, and that's exactly *not* what happened! The man working didn't have a sheet to lay her on--instead he had me hold her sitting up on something vaguely like a music stand, about five feet in front of a blank screen in a very dim room. He then did some quick photoshopping to make the picture brighter (why he didn't just turn the lights on in the room, I have no idea). It's not a flattering photo of my kid (she's all slumped, because she's not old enough to sit up yet), and there's a grey dot right in the middle of her forehead from dirt on the camera sensor. All this for the underwhelming price of $20. \n\nI wish now I'd done it myself--I've got a professional dSLR and a great portrait lens; I just thought it'd be a pain to find somewhere to print a color photo. :P","178":"Rule No. 1 - never go shopping when you're hungry.  Rule No. 2 - never wait for the rage to wear off before being honest on Yelp.  \n\nI took my dog here for a teeth-cleaning.  After being told he was ready to be picked up at 8:30 p.m. - but he had to spend the night, because I couldn't get back over there - I went to retrieve him the next day at 11:20 a.m.  At 12:40 p.m., my dog was finally delivered to me.  I was told that the doctor was doing exams on other animals and couldn't release mine until he was examined again.  They said, \"we usually tell people to call first.\"  I reminded them that I did call first, and was told the dog was ready to go.  \n\nFor crying out loud.  Tell me he's not ready.  Tell me he's ready.  But tell me the truth, because I don't have an hour and a half to wait to have my pet released to me after his treatment was completed the day before.","179":"This place was pretty good. I would love to come back and do build your own tacos some time. Nice poblano tomatillo salsa too","180":"So happy they now serve Water Avenue Coffee *^__^*  and stopped serving Stumptown (who was bought by Peets and then bought again by some giant German entrepreneur who owns huge cosmetics companies (under the name Coty) and also owns Keurig (the ones who produce the landfill filling k-cups) and many other companies (under the name JAB holding co.). Needless to say Stumptown isn't local anymore and it's quality has declined due to different manufacturing processes. It's great they changed it up here to serve higher quality coffee!\n\nThey also have a wide variety of pies and tons of bakery items, including gluten-free and vegan pies and baked goods.","181":"Service was prompt and nice. Sushi was not the best. I have had better and fresher from Sato I and II. Kagawa in Quincy is also better. Fish was a bit stringy...a clear sign it was not that fresh. Portions were ok, but nothing to rave over. Miso soup tasted like it was out of a packet. Green tea was not fresh leaf brew. It was a tea bag served with hot water in a cup. I would not serve tea like this at my home. They can def. do better. We won't go here again.","182":"Won't be goin back there. Waited for a table for over 20 mins to be next in line and have someone come in, cut the line, and take our table. Waitress did nothing. They lost my business.","183":"Wow, I usually don't read reviews before I write a review, unless I read them before I went to a place, which I do frequently.  That said, I did in this situation, and found that a lot of people bashing this place for some entertaining reasons.\n\nTwo reviews near each other that made me smile, one was bashing Hazel's for not having enough people to help, the other was bashing Hazel's for having to many people to help.\n\nOther bashing this place for being too big, and having too much stuff.\n\nMany of them bashing this place for their rewards program, which you need to sign up for to get special pricing.  Really?!?!?!  Is this that big of a deal at this point in our society?  No one is forcing anyone to sign up for it, but if you want a deal, they would like some information as well.  It helps marketing, which you get more information on future sales about.  If it is that big of an offense to your world, don't sign up and pay the extra amount, but don't get the cheaper amount and then (@&#@( about it after.\n\nOk, off my soap box, all that said, I found this place to be OK, not amazing, but far from bad.\n\nThe pricing seemed to be decent, not exceptional, but not crazy high either.  \n\nThe selection was well above average, in really every section that we shopped in.  Wine, Spirits and Beer.\n\nThe high end beer selection was vast, but not amazing.  They had lots of stuff, but nothing that unique that I hadn't seen in many other places.\n\nStrangely enough, I think our favorite part of Hazel's was the digital pricing.  Yes, trivial, but unique and novel.\n\nThe cold, sterile aspect of the place on a whole keeps be from bumping it up higher, but that may change over time.  I would much rather have a liquor store be too clean vs one that is dirty.  At this point, I am comfortable saying that it is A-ok","184":"This place had good sound at some point in the past. Their system can't compete with Barbarellas.  They force you to use Porto-potties if you pay $12 for a show outside. Red7 was cool before it became commercial.","185":"Quite a disappointment.  I love spicy sichuan food, but I definitely won't be going back.  Yes, the restaurant is clean, tables covered in nice table cloth and it is spacious, but the food is subpar.  We ordered 6 dishes in total, and only one of them is a 3.5 star quality...most of the others are about 2.5 stars.  \n\nThey couldn't even get the classic dishes right, such as the ox tripe and tendon in chilli sauce and the ma po tofu!!??  The former dished used some subpar meat and you can really tell because this is a cold dish; the ma po tofu had some weird red looking watery sauce that just didn't taste quite right.\n\nOne of the other dishes we ordered was the steamed soupy pork buns, which we inquired prior to ordering whether it has soup and they said yes.  I was expecting it to be the shanghai style xiao long bao with thin wrapper and filled with soup; instead, they were large steamed pork buns (like the steamed bbq pork buns from dimsum) and they MIGHT have had soup in there before steaming, but when they came out all the soup has been fully absorbed by the bun itself, so we got some soggy buns instead and no soup inside!:-(","186":"Really good coffee and a great atmosphere! I don't give it 5 stars because the service is not always that good, but it's definitely a good place to hang out :-)","187":"I just moved to Austin from LA and notice that they have Little sheep here. I was so excited to try this place because I love Little Sheep. I used to go every week when I was in LA. First to say, I have no complain about the quality of food, the lamb was pretty good. The spiciness was altered which is understandable. What disappointed me was they don't have AYCE unless you have 6 people and up. That was a little inconvenient. Anyways, I will give it a nother go and see.","188":"We recently took our baseball team to Baby A's in Austin with a group of approximately 70 people.  Yes, that's correct.  This is a big location that can easily hold any large parties.  \n\nPurple margarita's were on point, and all meals were turned out pretty good.\n\nJacques, Luz, & Roxanne were absolute champs, and took great care of our group.  Thank you!","189":"I don't know why but I love the atmosphere here. The bread (lavash) is REALLY amazing. I really recommend the babaganoush to go with the bread. I like the sis keobs or chicken patties. I'm not totally sure that the food is worth the expensive price...kinda paying for atmosphere and location. But it is something really unique. My brother has been to Turkey twice and says the food is pretty authentic. It's also a good choice if you're into healthy eating because the are a fair amount of healthy options. Overall, a good place to go when you're looking for something different.","190":"After this visit to Ruth's Chris I have given up on this steakhouse chain. We were in town for vacation so decided let's try a different location. I ordered my favorite which is the stuffed chicken. My husband ordered the seafood tower because he wasn't really hungry. My sister in law ordered the chicken as well. Unfortunately , they were all out of seafood . When my chicken arrived I cut it in half and noticed it was uncooked . This is the 3rd time it's happened to me at 2 different locations . My sisters chicken was uncooked as well. They took the chicken back and when they brought it out all of the garlic cheese herbs were cooked . That's the best part of the chicken. The waiter apologized but seemed frustrated that we complained . A manager never stopped by to even offer an apology. Needless to say we still gave him a 20% gratuity because it wasn't his fault. But we will not be visiting Ruth Chris again.","191":"Not what it used to be. \n\nThe new decor looks like a warmed over McDonalds.  Prices are up, portions and quality is down. Very disappointed.","192":"I went to Thai Hut this evening with some companions and definetly enjoyed my meal. Everything tasted very freshly cooked and not too greasy.  My sister ordered a Ladna dish that had great brocolli. My spicy basil was actually spicy and their tofu is perfect. It's pretty much the same menu as every other Thai place but from what I ordered they seem to have the basics down.  Portions and price were fair but not enormous (Chinese restaurant style). \n\nThere is very little seating so don't plan on bringing a large party or even being guaranteed a table.  This 'Hut' can get crowded when people come in for take-out so its not an intimate setting either. I thought the service was above average and friendly.  \n\nAnd one final note: BYOB! That seals the deal.","193":"Wanted greek close to the office: found my new favorite lunch spot.\n\nGreat food, staff was friendly, cozy spot, and the lamb gyro: insanely good. Free desert was a nice touch, will definitely coming back often!","194":"We always have a great time here. Our Itamea Joe was fabulous. We order the Lyric Etude it goes great with the lovers roll! The server's are always gracious and attentive.","195":"I went to this Denny's like I do most weekends to catch up with my mom for breakfast. I have to say that the manager Bill Skiff was awful. He was rude, condescending and treated us and his hostess Clara like we were annoying to him. I really did not like this. As a manager of customer service I would not want him on my staff. Ever. Other than that this Denny's is good.","196":"good food, good decor and friendly staff. One of our favorites. I love the morrocan influence, the waffles and they make really good coffee! The lavender mocha is a must try","197":"I've tried to go a few times to avoid the line-up but would end up leaving.  If you have the patience to wait, it is worth it.  The little pints if icecream that you can buy to take home are in glass jars which pretty cool. Don't recycle them when you are done because you can return them there for a $1.\n\nThe Whiskey Hazelnut is pretty good but I always end up ordering the London Fog. I'm bias..the icecream is great and the shop has a good vibe to it but Molly Moon's Earl Grey icecream in Seattle is still hands down best! Would it hold me over until I visit Seattle next? Absolutely!","198":"Ordered takeout and nothing spectacular.  We ordered a few fajita meals and enchiladas meals.  I was surprised that the fajitas didn't come with beans or lettuce, pico, etc.  Overall, the fajitas were enjoyed though.  The meal was packaged nicely and made it to us in one piece, that's a plus. Most times when you spend nearly $15\/Mexican meal you at least get free chips and salsa, not here.   We tried dessert, and it wasn't a hit. The flan got tossed.","199":"I recently got a hair cut and highlights from Eva. I liked her style and I trusted her skills. I was also very excited reading the reviews. Initially I was quite unhappy with my hair cut because it didn't fit my face. I got highlights the next day, and my initial reaction to it was also disappointed because the color looked very dull and didn't fit my face. It looks slightly better after washing a few times but still not super great. I paid a bit over 550 dollars for these two services which is a lot of money, and I think for the money that I paid, I had low satisfaction. She is a super nice person and very friendly, and she offered to fix anything I was unhappy about after a few days of trying, but I don't know what you can possibly fix after already cutting and coloring, and I do not like to be someone complaining and going for fixes.. However, I do think for the money that I paid, I was expecting something better for my hair. If you have really high expectations, maybe lower them. You will have decent hair after your new do but nothing special which may or may not justify the cost.","200":"This place has wonderful ambience and I think it could definitely be a great spot for a date! Service was fine, but food didn't stand out at all. Had French onion soup (lack of ingredients to me, very different from the other French restaurants that I've tried) and Ohio beef short rib indochine (really just an alright dish, I would suggest the prime rib French dip from Nordstrom instead). Can't speak about the desserts though-if I do come back, that's probably the only thing that I would give it another try!","201":"I don't like bubble tea, but I like to modify their cheap bubble tea into a fruit smoothie: no bubbles and no sugar syrup, to end up with a blend of fruit and ice.  Yum!  Also, they have beef teriyaki and rice for $5.  FIVE DOLLARS!  And the portion is huge, large enough for at least two meals.  This is my to go place for \"fruit smoothies\" and cheap food.\n\nEdit: It's been a few months since I've been, and apparently the beef teriyaki is $6.  Still super cheap, though.  And they have curried beef meatballs and rice for $5.","202":"Food was good. Everything was fresh and well prepared. Service was excellent. However, I didn't give them five stars because it was overpriced to me, compared to what you got. I paid more for the other Sushi places for similar upscale sushi but felt it was worth it. This place was good but kinda hmmm not sure if I paid for what I got.\n\nI","203":"Great to visit, easy to navigate and there's lot of info about what used to be posted all around the house! Make sure to walk the gardens and check out the outer house further down the property. Not much going on in the gift shop but the peanut butter pretzels were a great easy snack to have while walking the grounds","204":"I walked into Papa John's to pick up my order. I see 3 ppl on their cell phones. Two of them were handling pizza dough, and the other was cutting the pizza. Totally gross. Cell phones carry germs. No one had on gloves! Hands sweat and that can get passed on to the pizzas. Even during the Corona Virus pandemic, no one had on gloves. I will not be going back!","205":"I had never been here before and decided to give it a try with my friend. The place was a bit cramped. We ordered from the menu despite they offer sushi buffet. The food was fine, just a very mediocre sushi. But what we didnt like at all was the service. First, the servers there looked like they were fed up with life and didnt like their job at all. It was the most depressing place i ever ate. 2nd, we had trouble communicating with the servers. \n3rd, there were literally 4,5 tables and 3 servers yet it took them so long to take our order and bring us our food. While we were waiting, we ended up finishing our glass of water but there was no one nice enough to fill them up. Everyone was glancing at us and kept passing by. \nI really hope they improve their service next time. \n\ne.g  if youre looking for a place to cool down in this heat, sorry they got no A\/C!","206":"We went on a Saturday for lunch. This place is pretty big compare to the rest of the Chinese restaurant in town. They had enough empty seats at around 12pm.\n\nIn terms of service, the service was okay. There were only two servers in the entire restaurant excluding the lady standing in the front to do cashier's work. I had to go to the front to oder my cold dishes and go to the front myself for check out. 10% off for cash by the way.\n\nFor the food, my friend ordered the Signature Beef Lanzhou noodles. The noodles was delicious, and the soup was authentic. My friend liked me. On the other hand, my food was pretty bad. I ordered the Scrambled eggs with tomatoes. It's a combo that comes with rice. It was very disappointing. How weird that they put vegetables (bok choy) in the Scrambled eggs with tomatoes. The presentation was not good neither, even though it was colorful. The worse thing was that they put too much SMG in the dish, and the entire thing was too salty. I could taste the SMG. I understand that they want to use the SMG to make the dish more flavorful, but the Scrambled eggs with tomatoes should not be this amount of SMG along with the salt. \n\nThe cold dish \"Steamed chicken with chili sauce.\" was delicious. The chill sauce was spicy and on point. The Xiao Long Bao was okay. Wished they put some chopped vegetables in it because the meat (ground pork) was pretty greasy. \n\nOverall, it was a pretty basic restaurant. They put the tip section in a huge box on the receipt though in case customers won't see it. The food was affordable, but I was expecting more since it advertises as an authentic Chinese food restaurant. If you want to spend around $10-20 per person, this is the place to come.","207":"I'm a big fan of this place.  When we go to the food cart pod I always end up here and am extremely happy.  However don't have crazy high expectations which is definitely a danger when you average almost 5 stars. ...","208":"This store is totally as good as the reviews promise. If you are a games expert or a newbie, go here! Go go go!","209":"Great place for breakfast! Good prices! Their signature carnitas plate is bomb, along with the chilaquiles and aliss breakfast plate. Can be hard to find parking, and you have to know a little Spanish to know what to order","210":"This is one of my favorite German spots in town and it is so little and so unknown it is the perfect hidden gem.  From Schnitzels, Krauts, soups to the perfect sweets.  It is a little bit of Europe right here in Multnomah village.\nGo enjoy this place your stomach will thank you!","211":"Best veggie burger out of all the Porter Square and Harvard Square restaurants.  Great draft beer prices (good local beers too!).  To top it off, some great bartenders and servers too!  If you sit at a table, ask for Scott - he'll take great care of you.  If you come to the bar, the only night to avoid is Monday nights.  Other than that, you'll get a friendly and attentive bartender who takes good care of you.\n\nThere are a few vegetarian options at Rafiki.  I often order two vegetable sides and some bread.  All of which are delicious.  They make an awesome brussellsprout side-dish - it has a great garlic sauce that is excellent with the fresh bread.","212":"went there for the first time. place wasn't busy but somehow we waited 15 mins without anyone come to our table after we were seated. I ordered shrimp and grits, my husband ordered chicken and waffle which they no longer have. So he got the lamb burger instead. Food was ok, I liked the lamb Burger better than my shrimp and grits, the lamb was pretty nicely grilled, flavor was on point. However my grits was rather lumpy, the BBQ sauce tasted a little out of place with the dish. I give this place 3 star becauce you can't give two and half stars, and I don't think it's a bad place for a beer and a burger after work.","213":"Meh...I expect fusion to be something unique. The seared tuna was tasty but the golbi was boring. \n\nFunny. They have a steak and can add shrimp for $5 but for some reason they wouldn't let me add it to my order...so that was confusing. Probably their billing system doesn't do add-on...\n\nAnyway...gotta do more to bring about excitement.","214":"+  Great selection of beer\n-  Could have a better scotch selection \n+  Prices seem right\n+  Staff seems pretty knowledgeable and friendly\n+  Even when this place is busy (and it often is), they seem to get people through the lines quickly.","215":"Although my personal favorite for Korean red bean doughnuts and cakes is Koryodang (right across the street), Mozart is a very good place for yummy Asian (mostly Korean) treats.  They have a good selection of cakes & other desserts.  \n\nThe best thing I've ever had there is actually a Filipino desert:  Halo-halo (from Tagalog halo, \"mix mix\"), which is a mixture of shaved ice and milk with red beans and fruits, and served cold in a bowl.\n\nThe bubble tea is good too.\n\nI thought their English was very good - I think the girl who last helped me was Asian American.","216":"Can't explain how bad it's gotten. I get there and as I walk up to the counter both girls are in plain daylight texting on the phone while I wait for them to finish. I then checked in. The girl didn't see happy to be at work at all. So after having issues with there new locker system which u have two enter a 4 digit pin in front of everyone at the lockers. The bathrooms were out of tp n the shower were all taken so the only place to change was bathroom stall which were disgusting. The water was so cold my two year olds lips were blue n had to get out. Food was over priced $20 for 3 drinks n a pretzel n dip small snack. Next time will deff spend extra money n go to great wolf lodge.","217":"This theater was novel for us, with HUGE sofa chairs that recline and wait service. We went for the full deal where they give you a tub of popcorn and all. \nIt was comfy, but a bit much. I felt too distant from my date and the popcorn was overly salty. I went to exchange it, but the fresh stuff was only a minor improvement on the salt.\nThe theater unfortunately was really far away from where we were and we ended up coming in after the lights were down. That's just The Domain though. I think this place is cool, but not for everyone.","218":"Before our recent visit, we did some research and found that Finale was recommended for dessert.  We were even advised to go to the Coolidge Corner location since it's the least crowded of the three.\n\nSo, we went on a weekend night around 7 p.m. and were seated immediately.  We decided to try one of the shareable dessert plates.  What was on offer was nothing like what was mentioned on the website.  Some of the shareable plates were similar but not exact.  We ended up trying one that had flan, creme brulee, Boston cream pie, a custard with coconut and cairphirina (sp), a fruit tart,  2 miniature whoopie pies with raspberry sauce and a couple other items that I can't remember what they were. \n\nWe thought the portion size was just right for two.  However, we also thought that the flan and creme brulee were strangely flavored.  I guess that was deliberate in that it was the chef's spin on things.\n\nIn the end, I guess we were expecting better after reading all the hype.  It wasn't bad yet, for us anyway, it was nothing to rave about either.  We don't regret going but doubt we would go again...","219":"Ewwww! Most unfriendly staff ever encountered.\nCould not follow instructions for the cut I requested. No one spoke English, did not feel welcome at all.\nNeed I say more.","220":"The very first thing you notice is the Decor. Attractively decorated with an excellent color scheme, cool light fixtures and an impressive counter top with refurbished wood!! The next thing you notice is warm smiles from a friendly staff prepared to serve. The last and most significant thing is delicious food","221":"We have visited this location for years. The food has always been consistently good. The reason for the 3-star review is because, since the remodel, this particular location has lost its \"homey\" feel. We always felt welcome, employees were extremely friendly and helpful. Now? It feels very \"corporate\" and you get the blank stare from an employee if you dare ask a question. I get it, it's all about the \"bottom\" line, however, in making that extra dollar, you've lost the \"character and charm\" of this particular location.","222":"I got upset stomach after eating here. And I'm very tolerant of spices\/different flavors.  But no, i had to toss 1\/2 of the food out. \n\nI ordered the combination plate with you choose 2 entrees and it came with rice\/thin nan like item and a small cup of soup.  They all tasted fine (not amazing) but the fact it wasn't fresh shouldn't have happened. \n\nI'm gonna stick to my neighborhood gem (inman sq Punjabi Dhaba) instead of coming back here.","223":"I'd heard this was the place you want to go the morning you're nursing a hangover.  What I figured that means is: 1) they serve breakfast (and true, they open at 9:30a) and 2) it's some damn greasy food (I can't confirm this from my experience).\n\nFirst of all, I was kind of surprised that there was no table service here.  You just order at the window and they holler out your order when it's done.  This is part of why it's such a cheap meal, I suspect.\n\nWhile we stood perusing the menu, I asked the guy behind the counter what we should try, given that it was our first time there.  \"Our burritos are all great,\" he said.  I thought he might actually recommend the tortas, given that this place is called \"Super Torta\".  Guess not.\n\nSo, in the end, my party of two ordered:\n- carnitas burrito\n- fish taco\n- chicken taco\n- beef tamale\n\nThe tamale was not worth our time.  Dry, dry, dry.   The masa was almost crisp, which I considered tragic.  It's so hard to find a good tamale.\n\nThe chicken taco was quite good!  Served with two little tortillas, this was piled high with nicely-seasoned chicken, beans and a little fresh, chunky salsa.\n\nThe fish taco -OH MY GOODNESS- was so tasty.   Shredded lettuce and a little bit of thin sour cream really topped this off nicely.  \n\nThe mack daddy, though, was the carnitas burrito.  Jumbo-sized, for sure.  It easily serves two.  The carnitas was not greasy at all, and was flavored impeccably.  The pork was served cubed, versus shredded.  Really tasty, and the highlight of the meal.\n\nWe left with bursting bellies, pretty surprised at how delicious the food was (given the slightly janky surroundings). Plus, it's super-duper cheap.  Our bill was $12 for all of that food!\n\nI'm definitely going back to Super Torta.","224":"Drinks here are SO CHEAP. And they get a four star review specifically for that reason. This isn't the place to come and get quality fancy cocktails, but it's the place to go with a big group if you want to drink a lot. Great prices at all times, and even better  during happy hour!","225":"his is the worse company!!! called for a pick up and they kept me informed through the process and when cab got there and didnt want to wait since my friends flight had not landed and i said that they could turn the meter on, since the lady said guy would not wait for 5 mins and my friend gets outside and he's left. this was a private airport pickup, so its not like cabs are lined up. then i call them and i've been on hold for 15 mins, yet they are quick to answer to book a cab yet not when you are trying to tell them the driver left. HORRIBLE DO NOT USE!!","226":"One of my go to places on my way home from work. Love their salads and street tacos. One of the only places in Portland that serves California style tri -tip and they do it well! They have a happy hour for when I want to stay in, or takeout (which doesn't take long at all). I also tend to get a pound of sliced tri-tip to-go. Great to add to meals for the week. Check it out! You won't be disappointed.","227":"I went to this Applebee's last night with a friend of mine. We were seated as soon as we got in the door, but we didn't see our waitress for about five minutes. This wouldn't have been a problem if there hadn't been only about four other parties in the restaurant. it then took about fifteen minutes for our drinks to arrive, we had both ordered waters with our drinks but those hadn't shown up. We also didn't have napkins or silverware. We then ordered our food. My friend ordered a cheese quesadilla and specifically asked that there be no meat in it. What arrives? A chicken quesadilla. My friend confronted the waitress and she seemed pretty annoyed that my friend would confront her about the wrong order. She did ask if my friend would like a new one, but my friend said no shed just like it off of her bill. I, myself, ordered a chicken tender basket that was pretty disgusting. It was soggy and horrible. It then took about a half hour for us to get the bill. We asked for separate checks. What was on her bill? The chicken quesadilla. It took talking to three different people to get the chicken quesadilla off the bill. The manager was not helpful or apologetic. He just said \"OK\" to taking the error off of the bill. When my friend gets the new bill, my meal is added on there. Going to this Applebee's had to have been one of the worst experiences ever. Only go there if you like rude servers, gross food, and would like to leave feeling frustrated and angry.","228":"The cheesy garlic bread was very good to start. The pizza had a nice crust - crispy on the outside but a bit soft on the inside. We tried a pizza with tomato, spinach and feta; it came with big chunks of feta and whole sliced tomato. The flavor was very good. It was also fun to sit in the restaurant while they cooked our pizza - so many people came through, with many regulars exchanging greetings with the staff.","229":"I would never recommend this Enterprise location, because the staff is so incredibly rude and inconsiderate. My husband and I have been renting from Enterprise for many years, and we have never received this type of service. First they were not able to help us exchange our rental for a suitable car (even though our car was having multiple malfunctions), but that wasn't even the worst part. While we were there they were very unprofessional in the way they communicated, deciding to chit chat with each other instead of actually talking to us...again we tried to overlook it. The last straw was when they started talking trash about another Enterprise employee at another location, who was the only person in this whole nightmare that was actually being helpful. These staff members need to undergo some serious training in customer service. Even if they couldn't work anything out for us the least they could have done was be nice, empathetic, and professional but apparently that was just too hard for them.","230":"I wont say no to this place yet because like one of the previous yelpers mentioned, the staff here is extremely friendly. Let's talk about the food and space....It's located close to Fenway, and the space is VERY tiny. I wouldn't recommend it if you had a big party because I'm not sure where everyone will sit. The dealio is this: you walk in, place your order with a nice Asian lady (the anthesis of me), pay her in cash, and sit awaiting your food.I ordered the drunken noodle aka pad kee mao. IDK maybe it's because I've worked in a thai restaurant; maybe it's because I've eaten so MANY pad kee mao's in my lifetime, this was not that impressive. I asked for it to be thai hot, and I know what I'm getting myself so when the food comes out and it's not even spicy...I'm going to have a problem with that. My friend got the hot and sour soup which I tried and that was pretty good; it was nice and sour with tons of spices (maybe that's where all the spices went for my drunken noodle). Im willing to give this place another go since I did like the staff so much; I just hope the next dish wows the shizzle off my sock!","231":"I have no idea why this place has a high rating. Walked in to grab a small bite for breakfast and a man pointed at me and then at a table...So, ignoring the rude briskness of the encounter, I assumed I had been seated and sat down. However, after 2-3 minutes nobody had approached me. Then, the same man came nearby me and directed two women behind me to another table and similarly walked away. After another 2 minutes he came back and took their order, walking by me again. At that point I contemplated leaving, but saw that they had a register where you could order and given that I am lazy and my jacket was already off, I stayed. I ordered a crepe and a latte and sat back down. Almost immediately, the man came over and annoyedly asked if I had just ordered at register. I said yes and he walked away. After 5 minutes and no latte, I went over to inquire (the place was not busy btw, several open tables). The woman at register said it's not ready, but will be right up. I received it in another 2-3 minutes. Then, after another 10 minutes, the man, who had been dropping plates of food off at the other tables, called across restaurant that my crepe was ready and left it next to register. After hauling it, and silverware, and napkins back to my table, I finally was rid of any dependency on these people. The crepe did look delicious. But alas, the awful experience was made complete. The bottom had been so over cooked that I had to use the butter knife as if I was cutting a burnt pork chop. \n\nLook elsewhere for breakfast and any semblance of service.","232":"Not a fan. The men rented their tuxes here for sister's recent wedding. There were things wrong with my husband's tux, my father's tux, and my new brother-in-law's tux! \nOverall, it just wasn't a great experience. The service was so-so and normally my husband feels super sexy in a tux - this one made him feel frumpy. We've had far better experiences elsewhere.","233":"Had a great time last night at Swank. Super enjoyable staff that made a last minute birthday dinner look like I had planned it for weeks.  Excellent food and wine choices. Excellent atmosphere.","234":"I have been going to Hub Pub for years now and will not be going back after tonight.  Today myself and 10 friends were asked to leave without clear cause.  One of my friends was on the second floor and accidentally knocked a menu off of the 2nd floor onto the 1st.  The menu struck someone on the 1st floor.  My friend immediately apologized to the person.  This person went to the bouncers who then told us we had to leave.  We did not get a chance to event partially explain our side of the story.  We were only told that the person who was hit was a regular and the bouncer \"knew him personally\".  When I tried to speak the bouncer kept repeating \"you have to leave\" over my voice.   Myself and my 10 friends left after paying our tab.  I can only give my word that neither myself nor my friends were being aggressive, loud, or disrespectful in any way.  I have been to Hub Pub many times, as aforementioned, but apparently I was not \"regular enough\" to deserve due process..  The treatment we received was unacceptable.  If you are interested in going to a bar that is a dice roll as to whether you will be disrespected or not then that is your call.  All I know is myself and the people with me tonight will seek other bars in the area that do not value personal biases over the whole story.","235":"A perfect place for picky eaters-- I once went to dinner with a friend with gluten free allergy, vegetarian, and one who eats no greens. They have something for every single one of us! MY favorite is the hot an cold chicken salad: steamed rice, salad, sesame sauce, hot (and cold) chicken!","236":"My boyfriend & I came here for the first time the other day. The burgers were in our top 10 faves. We liked the sampler of beer you could try. Pretty nifty. Our waiter was also weird yet friendly. I liked it. We will come back here!","237":"I would hate to give this spot away as the places are so limited inside and I don't want it to be too crowded when I go in for my pizza craving. But seriously this is the best pizza I have tasted so far in the New England area - hats off for the chef as the ingredients blend so well that you enjoy every melting bite. You even enjoy the pizza slice the next day cold and out of the fridge. Yum just thinking about their pizza makes me hungry :)","238":"This time, we tried some food and the quantity was small, instead of asking us for gratuity they added 20% for our takeout order without informing us, and the person on the phone while placing the order was short and impatient, literally hanging up on us as the last words were still coming out of our mouth. Aah it makes me sad to review places with low stars especially during these challenging times but these are things the establishment can control despite Covid.","239":"Went here for a friend's bday lunch celebration.\nOrdered calamari and pear salad for appetizer. For entrees we shared Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and Toasted parma Proscuitto. The only thing I was able to eat was the seafood. I've had better calamari , it didn't have much taste to it. For the Mac and Cheese, I don't think it was too awesome.  I actually liked the pear salad out of all the entrees which is pretty bad because you can't really cook much for the salad. \n\nThe wait staff was really polite and accommodating; and very friendly. \n\nThe food wasn't great enough for me to trek over here from Boston. It was good but wasn't great. It was more of a eyy feeling..Unless your in the area, its a convenient nice restaurant to go to with work buddies but I prefer to stay in Boston.","240":"Smoke free....poor service...good prices...bad food...loud music","241":"My boyfriend and I just had our two year anniversary. We were excited to try a new place and Headwaters was on the list so we chose to go there.\n\nFirst of all, I hate it when restaurants ask you to pay for bread. Really? I'm going to be spending a decent amount of money on drinks and dinner and I have to pay for a roll?\n\nBotfriend had duck confit which was actually fairly decent. I had the whole roasted rockfish. Which was inedible. It looked great but was overcooked (rubbery) and under seasoned (no amount of salt could make this taste better). Coming from a Paley restaurant I was very surprised and disappointed. While I didn't ask the waiter to take it back, I was surprised when he didn't ask about it since I only ate maybe 3 bites. \n\nWon't be going back.","242":"I had a terrible experience here. I love Halal Guys and all, but the service here is absolutely awful. As we were leaving, a man working there literally SCREAMED at us from across the restaurant for reaching for hot sauce. Sure, I get it, maybe you wanna charge more for it, that's fine. But if it's just out and seemingly available, he could at least have informed us of this uncharge without being barbarically rude about it. Never coming here again, do not recommend","243":"Purchased 16' Airstream in 2016 from Orlando RV and traded up to 25' Airstream last year.  While aggressive, the sales team did what was necessary price wise on both transactions to win our business.  That's why Orlando RV gets a second star.  Checked throughout the Southeast and I have to admit they were the least expensive for the exact models we wanted.  The Service Department on the other hand is a disaster.  Getting any warranty items fixed in a timely manner is impossible.  The constant technician and office personnel turnover adds to the hot mess. While the Airstreams trailers overall have been just about great, there have been a handful of nuisance items that needed dealer attention. Our 3+ years and 2 travel trailers of warranty experience with Orlando RV's Bad Service Dept. has been frustratingly brutal. Be forewarned. Find another repair service or DIY. We're done with O-RV. Good luck.","244":"DON'T GO HERE. i went for a week and there was no structure to the work. the old woman would just talk about her personal life in the middle of class. a waist of my time. they did not give me a certificate of completion because i did not finish the in class work due to the old woman telling stories about thing that happen to her, completely unrelated to driving. a complete waist of my time, and money. unprofessional.","245":"Great value.  Cheap but tasty.  Not great, but fast, friendly and the dining room is underrated.  Fresh salsa bar deluxe, hanging plants, a\/c, plenty of booths.  Better than many others in the immediate area.","246":"We got a table with a cooker right in front of us. The show was very funny, although he lost a lot of ingredients by mistake. The food was good, but nothing special.","247":"Great price on Dunlop Sportmax Q3 + tires that I needed for my '07 Suzuki SV650. Also, the staff is very courteous, helpful, and professional. \n\nI bought the tires online and had them delivered to the store in Austin, intending to have them mount and balance them at the store.  However, after riding all the way from my house in FAR southeast Austin (off WM Cannon), to their store on Research Blvd, I was told they do not remove your old tires.  You have to bring them the rims, with the old tires removed.  They were very understanding as to why I was frustrated, and I maintained my cool.   \n\nI understand they are not a full service shop, and they have their limitations, but this very important fact was obviously not made clear to me at the time of purchase. Otherwise I would not have ridden my bike, on the old tires, all the way to their store in north Austin.  I decided to just return the tires because it would have been too much hassle to ride home, drive back to the store  in my truck, go home, then on another day, find a way to get the bike and the tires to a shop to be mounted and balanced, which would have meant renting a trailer.\n\nI gave them three stars for their great selection, the good price on tires (although their gear isn't priced very competitively), and the service was very friendly and courteous.","248":"Sorry. We went in with high expectations that were shattered. Atmosphere was nice. But the food was really disappointing. If you know ANYTHING about Japanese food you will realize this isn't the real deal. Tenderloin was dry and boring. Salad was okay. Yakatori was just not great -- a Street yakatori shop in Tokyo would dominate what they make here. \n\nEveryone around us seemed to be enjoying the food but we were sorely disappointed. \n\nI recommend going to Asta -- the best restaurant in Boston. And skip this place.","249":"I did not really like this studio. Unless you take a series you will not learn much. The instructors each teach a little differently as well. I do like the fact that you will learn how to climb the heck out of a pole but spins taught are very basic. There's no level one two three ect... I feel the studio lacks structure as far as getting advanced. I also cancelled plans to attend a class only to have it cancelled two hours before starting (on 2 occasions) People in drop is classes are at very  levels even though some classes are geared toward \"newbies\" which makes you feel like poop if your just starting lol. This studio got me acclimated to pole shoes and climbs but am at home at my new studio.","250":"I typically have good experiences at Paggi house, bu then I realized I had never eaten there until today. The back bar is so cool looking, and the vibe is very cool yet classy. However, the Sunday brunch left something to be desired today. \n\nNot being much of a pork or beef eater, there are typical brunch options I do not do: bacon, sausage for example. The brunch buffet, priced at $24 per head offers some nice breakfast items, but others that left me cold. Maybe it was the fact that the food was, too. \n\nThe quick, onion gallette, and bagels were not on steam tables or in chafers, so they were all cold. Cheese plates that sit out at room temperature of a particular concern to me, considering the bacterias that form on them. I can get sick pretty easily from room temp dairy, so none of that. I opted for some fruit and smoked salmon (For $24?), and the salmon ended up being WAY to salty, even for someone who loves salt. \n\nWhen I returned to the buffet to look for something that may please the palette, I tried the french toast. I like it quite well, particularly with the apricot spread. \n\nOrdering from a menu of chicken and waffles, garden omelets, short rib eggs Benedict, and other savory choices was my third try at something good. The omelet delivered. It was fluffy, of good portion size, fresh tasting, and brought together the flavors well. \n\nService was good but a little rough around the edges. Is the expression, \"That's the shit\" considered appropriate waiter phraseology? \n\nI will most likely return to Paggi House, but not for brunch. Overall, the saving grace of the brunch items do not add up to the best value for my taste.","251":"One and Done. The food was OK and the decor was boring like a cookie cutter house in the suburbs. My company paid for the tab so that was that. We got a few apps and main dishes I remember not being anything special but then again I live downtown where for the same price the value is completely different.","252":"My friends and I paid a visit for the first time to this restaurant after work today. Wonderful decor, nice ambiance. Greeted and seated quickly after we sat at the bar for drinks. Loved the special drink of the evening. After more people joining us we a were seated at a table. \n\nI ordered the Calamari. Divine and melt in yiur mouth good. Afterwards the server brought us bread and olive oil and pesto. This needs to be bottled. It was just that good. I ordered the Chicken Asiago Pasta Blackened. Disappointed that it didn't have more flavor. But I packed it up and brought it home. The server also brought us mini chocolate martinis. It was a nice touch. I will definitely go back and order a steak next time.","253":"Ordered a frozen caramel latte. Was good; no complaints. The establishment is clean and modern looking---trendy, with a variety of coffee drinks and baked goods and sandwich selections. The staff---my server at least---was very friendly and kind. A nice little place to pop into while in the financial district\/waterfront area.","254":"I can't express how much I love this place. They seriously have the best egg roll, bones less spare ribs, and oh their beef teriyaki. The owners are nice and kind and always remember you. Try the beef fried rice and scallion pancakes. So good!!","255":"Had dinner with my boyfriend here last week (we both have been in the restaurant business for over 10 years) and decided to try Turners after eating at the one in Salem, Ma which I loved and have heard great things about our neighborhood location in Melrose. We ordered 3 appetizers and a Caesar salad to start: oysters, mussels, fried calamari which were all excellent!! When it came time for entrees we weren't that impressed. I ordered broiled shrimp dinner with rice and mixed veggies, the rice was dry and bland and veggies weren't that hot. The shrimp tasted like it was over cooked and impossible to chew. My boyfriend had the lobster pie which he said was ok but drenched in butter making it too saturated to enjoy. One thing I want to point out is when a table orders a bottle of white wine it's important for the server to bring a wine chiller. Our server did not bring a chiller, we had to ask her for one and then when it came to the table it wasn't cold so we asked her for a side of ice which she also forgot. This place is nothing more then an overpriced seafood restaurant that lacks that special touch. They also hire inexperienced staff with little to no wine knowledge or wine presentation. Knowing that Turners has a pooled house (everyone pools their tips) is exemplified in the quality of service. Maybe they should think about changing that policy because it's reflecting in the way their employees treat their tables: why go the extra mile when someone else can pick up the slack? Mediocre service and good appetizers gives Turners 3 stars. We will definitely consider coming back to this location but prefer driving the extra 30 minutes to the Salem store where the atmosphere food and quality is far better.","256":"I have been frequenting this pub since it opened and was even a fan of its predecessor a dive called \"Chickies\".  This is one of JJ Somers irish bars, but this one is my favorite.   Great staff.  Great pub food and live music on the weekends.  This is probably the most authentic irish pub in boston.  John Brown, who only works weekends, has been a bartender d' excellence since it opened.  A sweet kind gentle man with a great sense of humor who makes you feel at home.  This place has created the warmth that you normally have to travel to western Ireland to find.\n\nSunday brunch is amazing,  the best in boston.  Great after work or weekend spot to truly unwind and feel like you are at home.","257":"I read through these reviews agreeing and nodding all the way down. You will tear your hair out dealing with this agency if you just want to see a doctor every now and then. God help you if you are seriously ill.\n\nI was on a Silver PPO multi-state plan and for $400\/month I got a lot of unexpected bills and shamefully awful customer service. The customer service is particularly shocking.\n\nI just switched to Sendero which is much cheaper and supposedly easier to deal with.","258":"I needed a last minute repair and supplies and went here for the first time.  The person who fixed my tire was very nice.  However the last item I needed was a set of straps for my bike rack to help secure it better.  I believe the person who sold them to me made up the price at the last minute and TOTALLY ripped me off.  He charged $49 for two straps.  My mistake for not looking elsewhere!  I checked other bike stores and shops afterward and they all had the same ones for under $25.  Update - also found the bike helmet I got here to be almost double from that at other stores.  Total price gouge!   Be aware... shop around first.  Won't be getting accessories there again for sure!","259":"I usually eat bbcue in AUS but i will be back!!!! Awesome bacon cheese burger...juicy even though it was well done (like mine medium but forgot to ask) mini frozen margarita hit the spot as well...Great place!!!","260":"first time rented from Orlando, was told my reserved car was not available, ( MERCEDES CLA) was given other car- car was not working properly. returned it after 15 min.\n2nd time reserved from Miami(, *MERCEDES CLA), again reserved car was not available, was offered Chevy- I walked next door to Thrifty.\nIm starting to believed they simply do not have Mercedes CLA. \nReserved today -  Miami at 5pm, (its 9 am now) last chance. I hope for the best but prepare for the worst.  Will update as soon as I get my car- or NOT","261":"I have been coming here way before they renovated the place. Always had great experiences except this recent time when i came with my brother. My brother and i walked in and was greeted right away by a young lady at the front desk. I told her we would like to get foot massages for 2 and she brought us in and seated is right away which was awesome. We soaked out feet in a bucket of warm water for about 10-15 mins before someone came to work on us. Usually, they work on your neck and head while you're soaking your feet, but i figured the ladies sitting outside in the front were probably busy on the phone or eating or doing something...or maybe it's not their turn yet? Heck idk. But yea I really didnt mind the soaking because it's relaxing and i really needed to relax and relieve the stress. So, after about 10-15 mins a skinny older lady and a young lady that greeted me came to start on us. The older lady worked on my brother while the younger lady worked on me. I was excited by this point because they finally came and i've been waiting all day for this. So the lady started on my head and neck, and it was awful. It pretty much went downhill ever since she touched my face. I felt like i was getting a facial or something. She was lightly touching my face and head like i barely felt anything. She even put her fingers in my ears like INSIDE..it was weird. I have never had anyone put their fingers in my ears, it's usually just on the outside, but i figured maybe that was her way of massage so whatever. So, as she continued on to my neck and shoulder, it got worst. It was like she didnt really know how to massage. So my conclusion is she probably has a facial license and not massage, which would explains the facial motions with the face and the horrible head and neck massage. So after a while, a young man came and took over from the lady that was working on me. Thank goodness!! The experience started going uphill from here until the older lady that was working on my brother started talking to the guy working on me. I have no idea what she was talking about, but she just kept talking and talking and talking. Sh  was giving my a headache because i was trying to relax and yet she just kept on talking. The guy working on me did great because eventhough she kept talking to him, he just nod or give very soft short answers back. Not only that, but she kept getting up. Usually, it's just one person out of the two get up to get the towel\/hot stones\/stick and come back. My guy sat on the outer side so he got up to grab the stuff, and she just kept getting up after him and gossip all the way. Smh. So, after the massages are done we got up to pay and i gave the guy working on me some tip, but not the older lady because she really ruined my experience with her nonstop talking. I gave her 60 dollars for the two foot massages and handed my guy some tip while not handing her any. She looked at me and put her hand out and was like, \"tip?\" And i said, \"sorry, no tip for you..\". She then gave me the stare like how dare i not tip her, so i proceeded to explain to her the reason why im not tipping her and she put her hand out again and asked again, \"me no tip?!\" And i said, \"no, sorry\". Then she just looked the other way like she dont even want to look at me because she just disgusted that i dont give her a tip. Smh.","262":"Cool atmosphere, cool music, and lots of beautiful (knowledgable) women to cut your hair. Reasonably priced too with shave, hot towel and back message. \n\nDown side - I get a great haircut but, it's not exactly what I ask for. It's usually fairly close but, I'd be more happy if you listened to exactly what I wanted and not put your own \"spin\" in it.... I usually end up with a buzz cut instead of a nice scissor fade like Ive asked for both times I've been here.","263":"I always try to make an effort to sample what the locals eat.\nThis small place is located in a working-class neighborhood.\nI found it on the web and decided to give it a try.\n\nI ordered Ziti with meatballs. The sauce was thick with gusto, as one expects from slow-cooking totato sauce.  It's a bit on the salty side (to me), perhaps it's something a tired body needs after a long day of toiling.\n\nI observed that most of the patrons are the take-out kind. If one needs a quick dinner after a long day at work, this is definitely a good place to stop by. In that regard it deserves 4 *.\n\nThe portion is generous and I felt satisfied after devouring the pasta and meatballs.","264":"A really great place to eat in the area. A hidden gem among the sea of chain restaurants in the area. Great food, well portioned, and great service.","265":"Took 40 minutes for a counter staff of five to take care of eight renters ahead of us.  Staff is ineffective or business process needs improvement.  Other Budget locations are much better.","266":"This place is amazing! The perfect amount of veggies and meat. The bread is toasted on the inside but still soft on the outside. I'd definitely come back.","267":"2 stars for the General Tso's Chicken Sandwich. And drumsticks. The presentation is perfect, but the taste and \"eatibility\" is poor. The chicken in the sandwich is over cooked and the sauce is weak. The whole combo needs rebuilt. The sandwich falls apart too fast. You almost need 3 skewers to hold it together while you bite. Super messy too, so bring some latex gloves to wear. The drumsticks are better, but the sauce doesn't taste that good. The atmosphere is good, rustic look with brewing equipment visible. Only two 49\" screens for viewing the games. Bench style seating (4 benches that comfortably hold 12 people each) and a bar that holds around 12. \n\nThe service is great though. We had a large party of over 20 people. The waiters and waitresses were very kind and patient. The food came out quick and warm. Overall, it's a basic bar. Not too bad or good, just plain.","268":"*** UPDATE 3\/3\/2008 ***\n\nWe decided to try Habana again, due in no small part to a friendly email from Habana management, expressing their regret at a less-than-stellar dining experience.  We were also informed of their Monday happy hour deals!  On Mondays, there's two-for-one deal on Cuban sandwiches and $3 margaritas and mojitos.  Awesome, really.  We had the Cuban sandwiches this time and they were delicious.  For $7.95, it was already a good deal.  During happy hour (4pm - 7pm), you get two sandwiches for that price, which makes it close to the best deal in town!  Moved it up from 3 stars to 4 because of it.\n\n****\n\nWe tried to go to Buenos Aires Cafe last night, but found, upon pulling up to the restaurant, that it's closed on Monday night.  So bummed out by that.  As an alternative, we dropped by the nearby Habana Soco, instead.\n\nAnyway, we put aside our disappointment and set out to enjoy a good Cuban meal.  I really, really wanted to like this place.  Now, I'm no expert on Cuban food, but I thought our food (and Habana, overall) was decent.  Far, far from great.  Close to being good.  In the end, just decent.  \n\nThe ambiance was nice, for this type of place (could possibly be a bit tacky).  Reminiscent of a tiki bar in its attempt to seem tropical, with abundant outdoor seating.  It was too cold to sit outside, but the patio looked clean and maintained.  Overall, the place has a laid back and unpretentious vibe.  \n \nThe wife and I both had the pulled pork, which was touted as their best selling dish.  I liked the portions...the value, though, was average.  Plenty of food, but the price of $16 was not great.  Furthermore, the pork was on the dry side.  It was no better than carnitas I can purchase for half the price at La Michocana or most Mexican carnicerias around.  I couldn't distinguish its \"Cuban\" flavor at all.  And, yes, I know that Cuban food is more on the \"bland\" side.  Still a letdown.   \n\nOur friend had the Cuban pulled pork sandwich, which looked really good.  Ironically, the pork in the sandwich is the same as the one I ordered, but it was so much more moist!  It was mind boggling how different the two were.  Besides, the thing was freakin' huge and coming in at a price tag of $7.95, it seemed like a great deal!\n\nDo try the Tres Leches cake, too, as it was one of the best of its kind I've ever had.  \n\nMy overall sentiment towards Habana was that it's a mixed bag.  The sandwich really did look good, but I don't know what to make of a restaurant whose signature dish disappointed to the degree that their pork disappointed.  It was fine for a last minute, we-need-somewhere-to-go choice, but I'm not sure if I'll be going back anytime soon.","269":"So slow! They have plenty of staff working but I constantly wait for 15 - 20 minutes to complete one simple task at the copy center. I was having trouble with the copy machine and it took about 10 minutes for someone to come help me. Further,  when I did check out the sales attendant was on the phone with a friend the whole time.","270":"I could die happy here. This is one of the most solid brunch spots in Austin and I'm so grateful that I discovered it a few years ago. Their benedicts are inventive and delicious, and honestly way better than snooze (overrated af). You've gotta either come to Arturo's super early or late to avoid waiting in line forever, but the food is so comforting that it's worth it. Many a Sunday morning I've rolled into Arturo's at 2pm with a pounding hangover and they've never let me down. Keep doing what you're doing Arturo's","271":"This place has almost totally capture my heart.  Almost.  My heart is an elusive tiger, roaming free about the coffee shops of the metro Boston veldt, and Fuel is the trap that keeps threatening to take me forever.\n\nWhy?  That's a fair question.  \n\nFirst, it's an all around great coffee shop for getting work done.  It has a lot of space, including high ceilings with exposed duct work.  It has a great mix of seating, including wrap around benching, standard chairs, lounge chairs, a hightop table (with what look like incredible painful iron chairs), and bar seating.  They have free wifi and decent music.  I have already written a lot of dissertation there.\n\nFood and drink wise, the sandwiches are good but maybe a little pricier than I want to pay.  The drinks definitely run a bit expensive, but they are tasty.  Their iced tea is a little dull, though, and the options there are limited.  Also, coffee people, there are not free refills.  And I have effectively been ruined by free refills.  I would probably take slightly less in quality on the drinks if I got more in the refill category.  (They do put out carafes of water though, so you can drink your fill of the H20 if you'd like.  )\n\nIndeed, free refills would keep me coming back.  It would trap my tiger heart forever.  i would probably even build myself a murphy bed right into their walls just so I could stay forever.  But for now, I will continue to roam, to hunt, and occasionally to attack.","272":"I had bookmarked this as one of the places to try based on all the good reviews on here....BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED! My husband and I brought my dad her one night for dinner when he was in town. I ordered the Chicken and Vermicelli soup....was so looking forward to it and was completely disappointed. The soup was literally broth, shredded chicken and vermicelli noodles. Where were the veggies? The chicken was also very dry and rubbery. How could they screw up something so easy? Anyway, the food was mediocre at best. Perhaps I came on one of their off days but it was terrible!","273":"I always really enjoy myself there. The coffee is delicious, and I especially love the cortadito. The parking can suck... often, because the parking lot is really tiny. So, I say carpool when you are going with friends (which is better for the environment anyway), or walk if you are close enough to (because that is even better for the environment and good for you, and it's a great neighborhood so the walk will be nice). There is a really big outdoor area, and dogs are welcome. They even have some super delicious grub and gluten free baked goods (YAY!). Totally recommend checking this place out.","274":"Calling was mentioned in a previous post ~~I tried today and all I got was a recording with the hours ??  Three times\nWould I drive through traffic to see if they had what I needed ~~NO \nSo pick up the phone and perhaps I can spend some money ~~I'm not wasting time and gas to come see!","275":"I've visited Saus a handful times and it's always been great for a some drinks and fries. However, this last time was a big letdown. \n\nMy husband and I were in the city and just wanted a snack before our dinner so we came to Saus purely for the fries. Our fries were like the crumbs at the bottom of your chip bag that you don't want to eat, but you eat it anyways because you paid for it kinda feeling. I wouldn't mind if the small fries tasted like the typical fresh and crispy fries, but these were like 50\/50 chance of eating an extra crispy and overly fried oily fry. \n\nA dining experience we were looking forward to turned out to be such a bust.","276":"(if zero stars were an option i would have selected it). I purchased a home cleaning through groupon back in march\/april. the cleaning was NOT worth even the heavily discounted amount. It was the worst cleaning job i have ever seen. (not the least bit thorough. most services were left as dusty as they were when the cleaner arrived). in the time took me to return home to let her in i could have done a better job myself.\n\nThen... handybook.com started charging me recurring charges of $87 without my permission?!!?!?! (which i am still fighting!!!!) WATCH OUT! DO NOT EVER USE THIS SERVICE!!! HANDYBOOK IS A SCAM!!","277":"Do NOT order take out from these folks! not only have they forgotten entrees or given us the wrong entree, they told us both times \"you have to check your own order to make sure it's right!\"...opening up 5 entrees every time my family orders is a bit much. \n\nTheir success, i'm afraid, has bred this \"too bad\" attitude because they used to be so nice and considerate years ago when they first opened.","278":"I've been taking Basic Illustration classes for my Graphic Design certification at ACC. My professor recommended this place to me. It's by the UT Co-op which I love to window shop. The Art Store is small compared to Jerry's Artrama. Luckily I had all those supplies I needed from my previous drawing class I took 5 years ago. I come here after work and this location is convenient. The employees are very helpful and give advice on which products would help for your project. The employee went asked me what kind of medium are you going to use it for and how big is your project going to be. The employee gave really good recommendations on what to buy. It was honest advice and not try to sell an expensive product for me. They also have good deals too. I was able to get drawing pads for $6 which normally be $9.\n\nMy advice for parking is to park at the UT Co-op parking structure or park on San Antonio St. Trying to park on the drag is a hassle.","279":"Today we sailed on the lunch cruise. The atmosphere and the food was good. There was 7 of us and no one drinks alcohol. We ordered 5 lemonades, one water and a 2 virgin mojito at the waiter suggestion. He forgot to mentioned that the $110 dollars ticket per person only included the food, water and coffee and that we needed to pay for all other none alcholochic drinks. Our drinks came almost 20mins later. This time  a waitress brought the drinks over. While passing the drinks out, she spilled all the drinks, soaking my husband shirt and pant, my sons pants and sneakers, my brother in law pants and my leather handbag. She ran quickly to get a cloth to clean up, and she apologized. The manager came over and instead of apologizing, or helping his employee, he threw 5 cloth napkins on the floor, gave a bunch to the waitress and walked away. I've never seen anything like this. The waitress again apologize and said, let me make it up, please order a round of drinks on me and the waiter will take care of it. Not knowing what she meant as we didn't know the lemonade that we ordered that was spilled all over my hubby, my bag, my son and my brother in law and the 2 virgin mojito wasn't included.  Fast forward to almost the end of the cruise and our waiter drops off our bill. $45, which included $21 for 6 lemonade and $20 for two virgin mojito (non-alcoholic) plus taxes. We asked for the manager and he came over and stated the bill is correct. So I reminded him, it seems it would be common courtesy that if your waitress spilled all the drinks all over these young men, that the least you should do is comp this. He stated, fine, I'll comp the lemonade that was spilled.  sigh. Look, the money wasn't the issue, but it's the principle. Smh #HeDidntGetThat \n\nWe left a hefty tip for our waiter needless as he was friendly with a hint of humor that made the ride enjoyable. \n\nWe are looking to sail one last time before the end of summer and I hope our experience is a better one as I think this could have easily been a 4star rating.","280":"Coles notes:\n- Atmosphere is weirdly sexy\n- Limpy \"crispy\" ginger beef\n- Price is right\n- No MSG option is nice\n- Have had better Chinese elsewhere\n- Wouldn't go back","281":"We enjoy the food from here, usually. However, last night, we placed a large order for pickup and noticed that the delivery driver had a knockoff Border Patrol hat on. I'd be pissed to order my food and have this waiting for me on the other side of my door. We paid the $80 cash for our food as soon as we entered and left a tip, and waited patiently about 20 minutes for the rest of the food to be prepared. We brought the food out to my car and when I went back in to ask for some plates, the man who'd given me the food asked who'd rung me up, with the implication being that he didn't know if I'd paid. I told him that I didn't know who rang me up, but it was one of the girls, and then I left with the plates. I would think that he would have asked his staff whether I'd paid or not, and not expect a customer to know who had taken their money. Overall, we were satisfied with the food, as usual, but I don't know if I'll be returning anymore.","282":"We happened about Fusion after seeing a concert at Hard Rock Live.  I wasn't familiar with CityWalk and husband discouraged me from visiting the bars (a wise decision; since I don't usually go to bars I forgot that a lot of them have cover charges), so when I started seeing signs for \"Sushi & Sake,\" I forgot about everything else and headed straight for the counter.  \n\nNow, once again, I'm going to chalk this up to my unfamiliarity with Citywalk, but $30 for 4 oz. of plum wine, 8 gyoza, a spicy tuna roll and a Coke seemed like a bit much.  It especially seemed like too much when the counter clerk charged us for a refill on the Coke.  But okay, it's Citywalk.  I picked up our trays of food and sat down.  \n\nThe gyoza had definitely been grilled at some point, but by the time they were served they were cold, which makes me think that the grill cooks don't get orders for them very often.  My husband enjoyed his spicy tuna roll but was quite sure that he was going to be hungry again shortly (and he was).  \n\nFusion is definitely set up as a \"snack bar\" type establishment, but the price point is way too high for a quick nosh.  Next time we'll just go to an actual sushi restaurant.  2.25 stars.","283":"The food is decent, but definitely not the best I've had. Not really authentic Thai food - I think there's too much sugar in the dishes. The pad Thai was good but too sweet for my liking; the curry dishes had enough herbs and spices but were not spicy or thick enough for me. I really liked the green papaya salad though! Overall good (service is nice too), but a bit below my expectations.","284":"A friend of mine took me here, and it's become the only place I'll eat if I'm looking for chinese.\n\nThough the wait may be long, there's a reason why it's always packed and it's because the food is delicious. There are more authentic dishes then tourist-y pop ones, but I can vouche for more than half the menu. \n\nThe service is better than most Asian-owned restaurant, though it's not the best. They're attentive and that's all you really need, dig in with everyone else and you won't even notice.","285":"I would not recommend this restauraunt to anyone. After ordering food and attempting to redeem a second voucher i purchased, i was informed that i had to sit in the restaurant in order to use the voucher. My wife and 1 year old son were with me, I asked them to come in so we could sit and eat. The waiter told us we would have to wait 30 minutes. I asked my wife to go back in the car and I would sit at the bar for a minute and then get our food we had ordered to go (as the gentlement insisted that i sat in if i was going to take the food). The gentlemen (server) at the bar told me that he would be taking a 18 percent gratuity charge from me without my consent. How rude is that? I told him I would be paying what I chose to pay in gratuity. Please stay away from this restaurant as the server was rude and disrespectful. I am shocked by his behavior. I wondered if the response would be different if my family and I had been white. Nonetheless, I dont think anyone should have to experience that kind of treatment. It seemed somewhat racist, in addition to disrespectful. I spent over 50 dollars at this restuaraunt and this is the treatment my family and I received. They will not be getting anymore of my money.","286":"One of the worst experiences ever in my life. Very rude attitude with poor techniques. Would never come back again.","287":"This place is fantastic. The coffee is great and the sandwiches are to die for.  The employees are friendly and the place is very clean. I gave this 4 stars because the ordering system is a bit weird. \n\nFood = 5\nService = 5\nOrdering = 2\n\nI am a process improvement guy so this is meant to be helpful to the manager(s). You wait in line and sometimes you are asked 3 times if you have been helped and it gets annoying quick. What they should do is have one person on the sandwich station because it seems that at times a lot of sandwiches are ordered, one person taking the drink orders (can also give pastries to people), one to two people making the drinks (depending on volume) and one person at the register.  The resources are there as there are generally 4-5 people working behind the counter at once.  Otherwise, having people constantly ask you if I have been helped gets annoying, especially if you go there daily like me (sometimes even twice a day).  A simple shift like that would make the experience better. Of course, you can easily tell me to pound sand, too. :)  \n\nOne last thing, some of the staff need re-training on the difference between a cappuccino and a latte. I have received a cappuccino several times and I've had to have them empty the milk because it's been almost filled to the top with milk instead of foam. If you order a cap, it should be the espresso shot and then milk filled to almost half the cup and then the rest with foam.  A latte is a shot of espresso, milk leaving around 3\/4\" of room at the top for foam.  \n\nLove Caffe Nero otherwise!","288":"On Sunday I had family from out of town visiting and wanted to pick a place with good brunch and not expensive. My family currently lives in Dubai and brunch is a big thing there so I had to impress them, naturally. After consulting with a friend who used to live in Boston she recommended this restaurant. They took reservations, I was so happy. It ended up being 6 of us at 11am (great timing, to beat the brunch rush). \n\nWe had the following: \n1 - Stracciatella scrambled egg drop soup, chicken consomm\u00e9, and parmesan cheese\n3 - Truffle scrambled eggs served over scali toast\n1 - Western - ham, cheese, onion, bacon, peppers\n1 - Eggs Benedict served with choice of half lobster, grilled shrimp or lump crab\n\nEverything came out nice and hot. It didn't take a long time for everything to come out. The portions weren't huge where you felt like you had to eat everything before you left. They were a perfect size and smelled great. Personally I ordered the (Stracciatella) which was AMAZING. The eggs were light and fluffy and there wasn't an overload of Parmesan cheese. It smelled great and was nice and warm for a cold day like yesterday. \n\nOur server was really nice and helpful on making recommendations. Downstairs wasn't dark and the decor was great. I was worried about it being loud in there but it really wasn't bad. And the glass of orange juice was huge which is plus.\n\nMy overall experience was really great. I enjoyed every bite of it. And I would recommend it friends.","289":"In my own personal experience, I think that this place is a bit run down and needs to update equipment and place as a whole.","290":"*Update*\n\nAfter my review, the GM reached out to me quite fast. She addressed all of my concerns and has apparently lowered some of the prices, and even offered to buy me a drink on my next visit. \n\nCustomer service goes a long way. I'm adding a star for this reason. I will update this again on my next trip.","291":"The Lee Vista location has been around for a while now and I've visited it more than a handful of times. I'm definitely safe in saying that I thoroughly enjoyed my food every single time I've gotten it. Sometimes the service can be a little bit shaky and depending on your meal it may be a bit too pricy, but overall this place has some high quality food and is always a good spot for takeout and sit down.","292":"We hit up Southland for their happy hour - $5 drinks and $5 food with purchase of a bev! I ordered the punch which tasted like juice - dangerous! I also ordered chicken wings to go with. The wings were dressed with a spicy bbq sauce and what I think was abit of ranch. Really good value for the amount of wings in a serving and they were tasty too. The wings were a touch bloody on the inside which was a little off putting. They had a great crunch to them though and the skin was perfect, I would have just deep fried them a little longer to make sure the center wasn't slimy. The restaurant is quite dark and I picture it being better as a winter spot or night hang out vs a summer joint. I also would love if they had live music, this place is big so I think it would benefit from getting a musician in there some nights.","293":"Man, I remember coming here for the first time around 5 years ago.  Their patio is crazy during happy hour and full of dogs and kids.  It's a real cool place if you have either of those.  It's also a good place for happy hour.  Their food though leaves so much to be desired.  Mediocre is the first word i can think of.  The first time I came I had chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes.  Total let down.  This was before I realized that all of the 'places' to get this dish typically are b\/c everything is bland.  The second time I ate I had a burger and was really let down because the sum of the parts equaled not tasty.  THEN I had their free brisket taco during happy hour and WOW!  It's pretty good!  Sad knowing that the best food I had there was free during happy hour.  THEN last night a friend and I decided to go there after going to the dog park.  I wasn't really thrilled about it but thought 'why not?'  I'll tell you why not.  We had a newbie server who was doing a fantastic job.  Not even kidding, took great care of us and great personality.  He informed us that burgers were half off.  We asked if that was ALL burgers and he said \"yeah, just not chicken burgers\". We said \"even speciality?\"  He said \"yes\".  Fast forward to receiving the check.  We really enjoyed ourselves up to this point.  We look and our burgers were full priced.  We asked him and he said \"yeah, I noticed that too and asked the manager and they said that it WAS discounted\".  We express our confusion and ask him to check again.  Then a manager comes out and explains the only thing discounted is 'meat and bread' and 'no toppings', otherwise they'd 'lose money'.  No further explanation was given and he assured use we saved 'like $5-6 dollars\".  We still didn't see ANY discounts whatsoever.  If anything we were more confused and I for one, was a little irritated.  The whole reason we got burgers was because they were half off.  I'm not a cheapskate by any means but if you tell me one thing, I expect you to keep your word.  Freddie's obviously does not do that.  I'll be more likely to enjoy a $2 frozen margarita and enjoy their patio and possibly some free brisket if i'm there but I'll never go here to eat again, especially when I can happily pay $8 for a burger somewhere else and actually enjoy it.","294":"pork belly and i came to shangri-la for lunch saturday. we were very excited abt it after reading good reviews about this place. the place was packed and we had to wait outside for about 30 mins.\nman, i hate places that arent even that good and you have to wait in line for!\nthis is one of them!!\nwhen i saw their menu, the stuff looked so americanized. a lot of rice plates and pork chop?!\nok so we went with the beef noodle and beef pancakes that other ppl raved about.\n\nbeef pancake. this was ok. the one from Chung Shin Yuan was wayyyyy better as i remembered.\nthey give a lot of meat. the 'pancake' is crispy, but lack of flavors i guess. and the shell was a lil bit hard.\n\n\nthe beef noodle soup was mehhh. the soup was good and flavorful but salty. they gave a lot of meat which was good. the meat's tender. BUT how can you sell noodle soup without handmade noodle!!!! why would i eat noodle in a restaurant if it is the same cheap low-quality noodle that you can buy from any chinese super market?! the noodle was garbage. it's 'gua mian'! soggy and not chewy! any place in china that sells noodle has handmade noodles even the most ghetto places. who eats 'gua mian' nowadays. even my dad makes his own noodles!!!!\nurggg\n\n\n'you tiao' - im not too cray about this. pork belly likes them so he ordered one. ppl like to dip this in soy bean milk. i also hate chinese soy bean milk. the soy bean taste is too strong! dislike.\n\n\nthis place was average, but no way im gonna wait 30 mins outside for this jank.\ndon't think i will return.","295":"Go here because you want to impress your 4-year old niece with your awesome pancake shape skills and your ability to buy her whatever pancake toppings she wants. Do not go here for the best breakfast in town. \n\nThe pancake side of this place is a lot of fun, but does not come cheap. Don't go on a budget or it will become stressful and not fun. Do not bring more than 4 people because that's pretty much what the tables allow for. However, if you want to have some pancake making fun this is your place. I've gone twice and the first was my favorite. I don't eat pancakes  a lot so the novelty really hit me. \n\nI always order non-pancake food for myself. The first time I went their potatoes were absolutely on point, my recent trip left me with overcooked, almost blackened cubes of blech. They don't seem to have a traditional eggs benedict but do have 3 other versions, which I found odd but whatever. Next time I think I'll stick to something basic like eggs and toast. \n\nThe staff is hit or miss. Some of them are genuinely friendly, some are barely holding their friendly \"mask\" on, and some clearly just don't care. I'm not sure why they chose to get a job at a child centered food establishment but whatever. \n\nAnyway, it's a 3-star joint if I ever did see one. Food is so-so, service is so-so (hit or miss), but it sure is fun to make funny pancakes to impress youngsters.","296":"The apple fritter was amazing! We wish we would have gotten there early as there were only 3 donut options left by 3pm. Good thing there is a location in our hometown of LA","297":"Great place to sit and study or work or hang out with friends!\n\nSeating upstairs and downstairs!  Delicious pastries and Tacodeli tacos!  Great coffee - in particular, I love their cappuccino and cortado!  Very modern and sleek interior!  \n\nOn Congress, so good luck parking!","298":"First time for grilled Rock Shrimp Excellent, would highly recommends this place! They start you off with corn fritters as soon as they seat you , they are so food? There like desert!","299":"Personally, I've been spoiled by the Monterey Bay aquarium, so my review is 'tainted' but overall I feel that Van Aqua is a good attraction to bring your visiting friends or family with kids. Just warn them against the sticker shock. At nearly $30 bucks per adult ticket, the value from the visitor's perspective is going to be justified by their own 'holiday expenditures' budget. For local residents it may seem steep and more of a 'donation to a good cause'. This is, after all, a non profit organization. \n\nThe exhibits are varied and interesting enough but somehow lack a creative quality and overall I found the lighting too low to view the subjects. The architecture of Van Aqua certainly has an alluring character. They seemed to put more dollars into highlighting the form of the structure of the place than the actual exhibits. Some of the tanks are impressive, like those that house the jellyfish. But other tanks are, I just have to say, boring. These poor creatures have to live in small enclosures. At least they could make them a little more interesting and visually appealing.  \n\nI've always wanted to see a Beluga Wale with out freezing my @ss off up north and Vancouver Aquarium has 2. But I was left with a feeling of pity for their living standards. \n\nThe interpreters are great and the work they're doing to highlight the importance of preserving the environment to protect these animals has to be respected. Many of the staff are Marine Biologists, students and educators. \n\nThe gift shop has a lot of great merchandise and prices are reasonable. The Cafe on the other hand, leaves a little to be desired in terms of variety, so you might want to pack a lunch, especially if you have dietary restrictions. Not ONE thing for Celiacs besides coffee, which is Saltspring. There are chairs & tables outside and of course, what a nice setting!","300":"Clean fast and friendly. What else are you looking for from your local pizza place? Location is convenient and I don't have any complaints.","301":"The 3 star rating, in my opinion,  rightly mirrors the quality of this restaurant. We tried their drunken noodles and their Cambodian style special luncheon menu (the name of which I don't remember). It was ok. It didn't have depth in the taste of their dishes; it's very straightforward. A lot of women in the neighborhood seemed to have gathered to chat, etc. It's a cute village restaurant so I appreciated the ambience. However, in terms of the food itself, it was mediocre and I would not come back again, I don't think.\n\nOne more thing- I also think for lunch options, the price was a bit high for the food. They are all above $10, and I've had much better experiences for $7 for drunken noodles in other restaurants.","302":"My falafel history is long and storied. For example, the night I got married (after eating a very well prepared four course meal), at 3am, I ate falafel on the streets of New York. I've been chasing that high ever since. But I digress. \n\nYou probably think you don't like falafel. Every other falafel place in New West and most in Surrey (Jerusalem Grill seems to be the only exception in Surrey) will reheat a prefried falafel ball in a microwave to make your wrap. The result is completely mediocre. It's not crispy. It's not the right texture. It's not... good. \n\nAnd then there is Taza Falefel House. You're greeted by your new Iraqi mother who cracks jokes with great familiarity and insists that you haven't really had falafel before. She makes it by hand. She makes it fresh. And she makes it just for you. No mix here! When we discovered this, our anticipation built. I am more excited for solid local falafel then Christmas (this is saying a lot). \n\nShe delivers. The falafel was fresh, hot, expertly prepared, crispy. seasoned. Next time I'll customize a bit more... do they have those delicious turnip and beet pickles? Maybe add a little extra heat for the BAM! Factor. \n\nI had a better fry experience than my fellow reviewers - mine were perfectly crispy and seasoned a dusting of spices. And while the interior isn't all shiny and new, it is clean which is far more important to me. And at the end of the day, the place could look like my teenage brothers bedroom. It's not like I'm spending all that much time there 0 the best part about a falafel is that it's quick healthy eats, I'm in and out in a flash.\n\nI am truly excited that this place is just down the street. I will be back again and again.","303":"This needs to be fixed. You can't charge me 50$ for a 1.50$ toll when I have the freakin transponder in my car??? And then when I call I get the rudest uneducated lady who does nothing but tell me \"You'ze needz ta reed the rulez before you'z be axin why weeZ chaaggin' you\". What a joke.","304":"The food is what it is, but I'm consistently surprised by the lack of customer service. It's so conveniently located that I keep getting talked into going back, but the servers, hosts, et al never seem especially interested in being nice or getting the orders right.","305":"This used to be fun. Now is needlessly expensive, tiny, and inauthentic. It's not exactly German themed if you hardly have any German vendors, now is it. The last time I'd attend.","306":"We were on the 34th floor and the view was absolutely spectacular throughout the day and night!  The panorama was of the entire west end --the bays, the bridge, the park and it was constantly in flux.  Just watching the ships (generally between 7-9 at all times) in the bay was a breath-taking treat.\n\nAs to the hotel itself.  It was okay; yes, it is an old hotel without fans in the bathroom and with bathroom lights that flicker on and off but the room was clean and fresh--there was a balcony with sliding glass doors so fresh air was a constant.  To me, this was great. Fresh bay air whenever desired.  I left the door open at night (it was warm and the area very quiet--very little traffic in that area of Vancouver).  So often, no matter what the price of a room, the room's windows are sealed and the room smells sealed; air-conditioning and\/or heat doesn't get rid of it.  (in the Phoenix Westin, I ended up wasting the walls to clean up the smell--those walls were filthy. With the fresh air in the Empire Landmark, I didn't have to clean at all.)\n\nThe restaurant on the top floor had a steady stream of guests going to it.  We didn't eat there, we actually didn't realize until the last day that meals other than dinner were served there.  On the day we left, we went up to see it and they were serving breakfast.  It was very quiet and intimate with just a few patrons.  I didn't realize that the restaurant rotated.  It didn't seem to be.","307":"Wow.  I've had Thai in several areas of the country but this establishment, hands down, has served me - consistently - with the best Thai I've encountered.  The service is some of the best I've received (always with a smile), very prompt to make sure everything is fine and the atmosphere is delightful.  It can sometimes be loud and busy but that's to be expected of a top notch restaurant.  The menu is immense and you can order the basics (pad Thai, spring rolls) or you can go all out (jungle curry, mango sticky rice, coconut mushroom soup).  No matter the choice you make here, if you like Thai - you will absolutely LOVE Titaya's.\n\n*Must try* - Pad Thai w\/ tofu.  Best with a Thai Iced Tea or Sprite.","308":"Love the green curry and Pad Kee Mao! Can add extra meat or veggies for only $1 too!!!","309":"All you can eat sushi and hot pot! What more can you ask for?\n\nI must say the price is pretty pricey so make sure you eat up! (Of course don't be wasting food or they will charge you for it!)","310":"Hubby and i tried this place and it was awesome! Dont be decieved by it being in a gas station, the tacos and the quesadilla were DELICIOUS! We will def. Be stopping by more often. Staff was super friendly as well.","311":"I love tacos. I even like \"middle school cafeteria\" tacos in a pinch. But the tacos served here are some of the best I've had. I was offered the special, which tonight was tacos de cabra and a bowl of soupa de cabra. Sweet Baby Jesus, I have hit the Mother Lode . . .  \nI also ordered a few lengua tacos for good measure as well . . . All the tacos were 2 home made corn tortillas stuffed with well seasoned and prepared meat ( goat & beef tongue), plenty of chopped cilantro and the right amount of chopped onion. The soup was made from the stock of the braised goat with rice and seasoned to perfection. The flavor was deep and complex. It was so, so good. The glass of cold horchata (loaded w\/ cinnamon!) was the perfect drink to wash it all down. There was a mild salsa and salsa Verde served as well. Both homemade, but the Verde was the clear choice for me. Gabriel, the owner was extremely helpful and just a great guy to talk to.  If I lived in Kissimee I would be here at least once a week. I was there a little late and was the only gringo there . . . I could have been in East LA. If you want to enjoy some solid, down home Mexican chow, this is your spot.","312":"Was in Columbus for just a weekend and found this place to get a few growlers of Bhodi. Unfortunately they don't know how to fill growlers. Each one of them had a few inches of foam. Even after I noticed it and said something, they couldn't get it right. So 6 hour drive home, hoping they don't lose too much carbonation.","313":"Every person I have talked to or seen at this location has been great! From the reception area to the Estheticians to the massage therapists! I love love love the coconut water that I get after each appointment. I love their candles, they make my home smell heavenly and they last much longer than other candles I have gotten elsewhere. I am looking forward to my next appointment!","314":"Great meat and 3 that has been around forever.\n\nI wish the pricing was a bit more clear and the staff behind the counter was more helpful (for a first timer) but the food was so good and affordable I didn't care for long.","315":"DELICIOUS FOOD COMA!! The decor is great, food is amazing and service is fantastic! The sides are self serve and I recommend over indulging on the creamed corn but the rest are good too. I had the mac and cheese, green beans, beans, and potato salad... compared to the richness of the other sides, the green beans were a little lacking but would be good on their own. Next you move to the meats and the brisket, beef rib and turkey were all moist, flavorful and delicious. Also, don't forget to snag a jalapeno cornbread, it was the perfect amount of corn sweetness to jalapeno flavor and not dry at all (you could see the peppers). They serve blue bell ice cream so ended up getting the peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was the perfect end to a food coma inducing meal.","316":"Not good. Ordered sweet and sour chicken and a few other items for my daughter & friends after a long trip,  and they all felt sick after a few bites. It wasn't just an unfamiliar flavor-the food actually tasted spoiled.  If you must,  stick to the Lo Mein.","317":"I'm disappointed on a number of levels. The restaurant is quite busy, especially for a Sunday night in August. I've been wanting to try Harvest for years. I am underwhelmed. Service is really lacking. It's disjointed and a bit sloppy. The person who poured my water and brought my bread didn't say a word or look at me. As a patron you have to be proactive, and follow up regarding the status of your food. I sat for 15 minutes before my server came over. After my appetizer I waited another 20 before he came back with my entree which just arrived as I write this. My haddock is cooked well but there zero seasoning and THREE gnocchi. Again the plate was just kind of dropped in front of me and he walked away. He didn't ask if I wanted another glass of wine ( I did but now I won't). Food is borin. They did however take care of my wine due to the long wait. Kind gesture, but I do not think I will be back.","318":"Wasn't sure what to expect, but we knew that we did not want the same old chain restaurant type flavors. Well, this great little pizzaria did not disappoint. It is so unique and the food is amazing. This time around we had bruschetta and 3 different pizzas. The tomatoes, the sauce, the cheese, basil and vegetables.... so good and fresh. They are meant to be single portions but they are big (which is great, we took them home for another round). I had to convince my child to stop eating; he was so full, but it was so good :) There were many other things on the menu and a mozzarella tasting that looked interesting. Looking forward to trying it all out.\n\nI know readers may get tired of hearing why someone knows good Italian food.... yada yada yada. All I know is that when the flavors resemble  my grandmother's cooking, that is perfect Italian to me. We will definitely be going back!","319":"I had always wanted to try this place. Who does not like food with doughnuts? Our server was very responsive. He knew the menu and made great suggestions. All of the menu items sounded great. I had a hard time figuring out what I wanted. I opted for a burger. The burger was good. I was a little nervous ordering a burger without mentioning how I wanted it cooked. The burger was perfect. I enjoyed the chipotle mayo. I got home made potato chips. You do not miss fries at all. The doughnut bun was a nice touch. My wife ordered a salad that came with a doughnut was well. A garlic doughnut? Who knew that could be so yummy?\n\nWe opted for dessert and got a brownie infused doughnut with cayenne pepper. It was the perfect amount of sweet and hot. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back. :)","320":"Made a new buddy Saul! He will definitely let you know of all the upcoming specials and he takes care of you! We had a large party of 8, and then 10 and he brought the food out faster than any other service I've had here. The food was also great and how can you go wrong with an awesome 20 oz margarita for under $10? #AwesomeSauce!","321":"My favorite chinese restaurant in Austin! Sometimes I catch myself eating here 2 times out of the week. I've been going here for years, excellent food, great service!","322":"Not as clean as the other Freshslice Pizza places.\n\nFood always good here.  Especially if you order a full pizza, made up, like a Greek Feast.","323":"Spendy, but great quality and amazing ambiance! Great for lunch on weekdays with their lunchtime bento boxes.","324":"The Italian Sausage pizza is excellent. My daughter loved the cheese pizza and they deliver in Westlake ($30 min).  I highly recommend giving this place a try.","325":"This place might have been good at one point, but it had been horrible throughout the covid pandemic.  I was trying to schedule both of my dogs for vaccinations, so I decided to go to one of their low cost clinics via The Rascal Unit.  I called 48 hours ahead to ask questions and confirm this was taking place, yet when I showed up, a woman said it was cancelled due to covid.   Then, I made an appointment at the actual vet.  My appointment was  for 10 am for two dogs, and I did not leave the place till after Noon.  The check in process is horrible.  You go to a door, to find a locked door and a sign to call a number to check in.   I called and got the voicemail.  After being on hold for ten minutes, I had my boyfriend call from his phone, and then I ended  up knocking on the door. I was greeted with attitude, as if I had done something wrong, and I was just trying to check my dogs in for their appointment.  You cannot enter with the animals, so you have to give your concerns to a tech, and then repeat it all to a doctor later on.   It just took forever and was a horrible experience.  On my return visit for the dog flu booster shots, it was even worse.   We had the same difficulty checking in and was finally taken over an hour late.  We were also charged $40 for each booster shot, and I was under the impression that the booster shots were Included in the first $40 charge for the flu series.  Nobody ever communicated another charge for boosters, and the website says the vaccine is $38 for the series, just like the receipt. ( We were charged $80 total for each dog.)   Two hours later, we were given back our dogs.  I will not be returning here.  The check in process is bogus and they act like they are doing us a favor by answering the phone.  When we spoke the vet, she acted like she genuinely cared for the animals, but the whole experience was horrible.","326":"Other than location and nostalgia this place falls short.  \n\nThe breakfast is average. Portions are good sized and the prices are on the cheaper side but thats really not enough to keep me coming back.  \n\nAll three times I have been here the service has been sub par, I understand this place gets busy but the last time we visited we were two of only six customers and still treated as if the entire population of SW Portland was waiting to be served.\n\nThere are many other places to get a quality breakfast for the same price.","327":"Great hospital with doctors and nurses that are caring and compassionate.  My only issue is with cost of parking for family members who spend hours and hours there, can add up pretty quickly.  But wouldn't trust anyone else with healthcare","328":"Would give them zero if I could. \nWorst customer service. Ordered from them an hr ago and they randomly canceled without explanation.\nDo not order from here.","329":"Love this little theatre. I always get a kick out of the old movie posters in the lobby; The Godfather, King Kong (1933), Rocky, etc. You get a great viewing experience and you don't walk out feeling like you've been ripped off like at the big chain theaters. Plus, any place that sells a 32oz beer for $5 can't be bad! My only gripe is, often times, the staff seem as though they'd rather be anywhere else on earth. I get it, it's work for them, but you're waiting on the public, at least fake it.","330":"I just returned and got the steak focaccia. Fantastico !!\n\n\nWhat a gem Great stuff here. I had a very special focaccia bread and a gelato. The chef \/ owner is very friendly, generous and committed to his craft. I look forward to exploring his menu more soon. \n\nHighly recommended.","331":"Spent Memorial Day weekend with my lab in Austin and made several trips to the Rowing Dock.  I was very impressed with how professionally it was run and the quality of the equipment.  They did a great job making sure it was fun for both me and my dog.  I was also very pleased how they handled the larger crowd on a busy weekend with minimal wait time.  I highly recommend and look forward to going back.","332":"Never have i seen a place with perfect 5 stars from everyone, of course its only 5 other people, but i had to try this place after reading them.  \n\nFirst off, i'm a HUGE fan of good mexican food. I'm not a Tex Mex adobe Gila or Don Pablos kind of person, actually i HATE those places.  \n\nThis place is the REAL DEAL.  I kid you not, the BEST mexican taco i've ever had.  I do the tres tacos, and recommend trying a different Meat that is listed on the daily chalk board.  Try them ALL! they are all good!  This place is my new sanctuary for prayer.  I'm quiting church and religion bc i've finally found the Holy One everytime i take a bite of these tacos.  My co-worker has been eating here now 4 weekdays and counting!  This will be my second day in a row, and he's actually bringing me a Pastor chimichanga RIGHT NOW as i type.  My mouth is watering and i'm kind of getting aroused also.  I think i'm quiting oysters and gonna bring my gf here to get in the mood.....ok i digress.\n\nThe place is TINY, it gets busy for lunch from 12-1pm.  The food is fresh, the little salsa bar is fantastic, and the owner is very friendly.  I've use every bit of Spanish i know to get on her good side because i know i'll be living here for lunch at least twice a week.\n\n Oh man, he just came back with my chimi....no time to type now. Andale! Andale!","333":"The food was average.  Terrible atmosphere.  Undrinkable wine selection.  The service was good however.","334":"Not a fan.  I visited Polished for a manicure and was not impressed.  Is it me or do all the staff  seem to have a mean look on their faces??  I also  purchased a gift certificate for a friend before my manicure. The woman at the reception desk (I believe she was the manager) was not very friendly or inviting.  I tried to engage my manicurist in small talk and she was very dry.  For a $19 manicure I was very disappointed.  I am not sure if I will give this establishment another try.  On the plus side, it is in a wonderful location.  The decor is beautiful and the shop is clean.","335":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars because the food was AMAZING!!! But just like the other reviews the service wasn't the best. It was average. Servers were really nice but kept us hanging a little longer than we would have liked.","336":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here on our way to St Johns River. It was recommended by a friend and also we saw the billboards on 95 so we figured why not! We got here at about 9:20 and they were closing soon but, that didn't stop a good experience. We were promptly seated and greeted by our server. She was a nice older lady who insisted we try the corn fritters, even after we declined. She bought them anyway and we're glad she did. They were great. For entrees, I ordered crab legs and my boyfriend ordered a fried Mahi sandwich. The food arrived quick and was nothing short of great. My boyfriend wasn't too wild about his Mahi but, he said it got the job done. I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and the friendliness of the staff. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite or a family style setting.","337":"Great food and drinks. Some of the worst service ever.\n\nTwo weeks ago we went to Sweet Cheeks for dinner on a Friday night to celebrate a friend's birthday (he had been craving some Q). We had a 9:15pm reservation. We arrived a bit early but they were able to seat us immediately because they didn't seem super busy. The birthday boy was very surprised when the menus (paper) came to the table and \"Happy Birthday, Justin!\" was stamped on them all. Everyone thought it was a nice touch and pretty sweet!\n\nWe were all starving and decided to order drinks as soon as possible. Our waitress took our order and proceeded to tell us that she and another waitress would be taking care of us. So far , so good. Then 15 minutes went by with zero contact from the waitstaff. Again, had it been busy we would have understood but it was pretty dead, there was plenty of waitstaff, and they knew we were there to celebrate. My husband could see our drinks sitting on the bar for at least 10 of the 15 minutes. And then our waitress finally went to get them at the bar...and proceeded to talk to another waitress as she took another SEVEN MINUTES to casually garnish them. You'd think these drinks each had a ton of garnish...they didn't. Again, having waitressed I would have totally understood had she gotten to the table and apologized but the woman didn't even acknowledge the wait. She tried to walk away from the table without taking our order and I loudly said, \"WE'RE READY TO ORDER.\"  Our drinks, by the way, Fenway Fizz for me (strong but awesome, not too sweet), brutal juice (which might have been our favorite), bbc steel rail, and the Federale (which was, unfortunately, too spicy for the birthday boy...though he refused to send it back which is totally on him).\n\nNow for the good stuff.  We've started with bucket o' biscuits - these things are huge and absolutely delicious and the honey butter they're served with is perfect. We all order our own meal but shared most of it. The fried chicken was very tasty, though the hot shake was pretty one dimensional - glad we got a side of the spicy honey to drizzle on lightly. Everything from the smoker was on point - Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chopped Brisket, Pork Ribs - all with the right amount of smoke, the right texture, and just simply delicious.  \n\nThe sides were a bit of a mixed bag. All of the cold sides were fantastic - farm stand salad is a nice change of pace from the usual bbq sides and both the coleslaw and the potato salad were fresh and bright. The mac-n-cheese, black eyed peas, and baked beans were all fine but not anything to write home about. \n\nWe again sat there for about 10 minutes when we were all done waiting to order dessert and have some stuff packet up. When the waitress finally came over and folks asked that things be wrapped up, I made sure to ask that they be put in different bags as they weren't headed to the same home. Our waitress, of course, brought one bag. \n\nAnyhoo - dessert - We ordered the Banana Mess and the Nutter Butter. Though a few of us found the Banana Mess a bit too sweet (the marshmallow sauce might have been overkill) it still hit the spot for the birthday boy. The HUGE Nutter Butter on the other hand could have used that marshmallow sauce - it was dry and there was zero flavor difference between the cookie and the (very minimal amount) of filling. I'd strongly suggest that they revisit that recipe to balance it out a little more.\n\nThe proteins, drinks, and biscuit get 5 stars. \nThe sides, as they were a mixed but overall good bag, get 4 stars.\nThe service, however, gets a 1 star. I have never had service so clueless as to how bag they were or how long they made us wait for everything. Beyond disappointed with this visit solely for the service. It was actually to the point that I'm really no longer interested in trying Tiger Mama as they have the same chef\/owner.\n\nWe'll definitely return but ONLY for take out.","338":"Quick, friendly service.  Good portions for the price.  It's my go-to for Seafood Udon - YUM!!","339":"Yikes. Here's hoping she gets us something better next time my boss buys us lunch. If you *have* to eat here, I'd suggest splitting your time between the turkey and the sausage as those were the least offensive of the four meats I tried.\n\nThough I wouldn't say no to more of that mac & cheese.","340":"My poor Shanghai Tokyo seems to be going through a change.  The General Gau's is merely just okay now, the spicy tuna isn't as good as I remember it, the prices are going up, and the quality isn't matching.  Still the only option I have for quick take out sushi, and the fried rice is still very tasty, but I'm starting to loose faith in my little go to sushi shack.","341":"I shopped around for the best deal at other Medford auto body shops, But David's quoted me the best deal by far. After getting side-swiped, the right car door and rear view mirror looked terrible. I asked him just to fix the door (figured I could live with the mirror damage, just being cosmetic) so I could save a little money. After only 3 days in the shop (very quick!) I went to pick up my car to find it in perfect condition AND he threw in the mirror repair for free! I was so grateful for his kindness. He said he wanted the car to look good to reflect the quality work that his shop does. Very professional guy, takes a lot of pride in his shop. If you're looking for the best deal around (literally, the other shops quotes didn't even come close) and friendly professional service, go to David's!","342":"Hands down the best pharmacy.  They are always prompt, professional and friendly.  I have never had a single issue with having medications in stock, picking up prescriptions or waiting in lines.  Before starting with Theatre, I was using the local Walgreens, which was a total nightmare.  I was concerned about the parking situation, but always manage to find a spot nearby.  Nice sundries too!","343":"Sunday, July long weekend. Hubs and I were looking for some food court food to try. Based on fellow Yelper's reviews, we felt that we need to make a trip to try. \n\nWe ordered #1 6 pcs XLB ($6.39), #4 beef roll ($6.69), and #5 pork and chives dumplings ($6.99) to try. \n\nThe XLB are definitely made fresh in front of us since the ladies are wrapping them while we ordered.\n\nWe ordered at 11:45am and the XLB and beef rolls are ready by $11:52am. Dumplings are ready at 11:58am.\n\nXLB: yes, so juicy and full of flavour. The wrap is not too thick and not too thin, which holds the juice well and also thin enough for steam to permeate through. Good meat portion\n\nBeef roll: crispy yet soft inside for the wrapping. Nicely fried outside. One order was cut into 6 pcs. Chives were evenly distributed. Meat was juicy but small amount since it is just one slice and not rolled around the whole wrap. Not a lot of seafood sauce so it is good that we can actually taste the flavour profile of other ingredients. Good portion just not happy about the meat size.\n\nPork and chive dumplings: took a little longer, but nicely steamed and fried. The filling was plentiful with lots of chives. Again, juicy. Pretty large dumpling sizes.\n\nOverall: this place earned our triple threat award (big portions, good taste, cheap). We will very very likely return again.","344":"I was so excited to hear about an all you can eat sushi place in GA...alas that joy disappeared as soon as I walked around the buffet, the sushi place out was just mediocre and not that great. For the price I paid for lunch, I could have gone to Ru Sans' lunch buffet and enjoyed their lunch plus drink.\nHowever, their dessert does make up for it!","345":"Buffets are ultra sketch.  Pan Asian's lunch buffet is legit; it's clean, the food is hot and fresh and there is a good variety.  Cheap, too!  I don't get to take traditional lunch breaks for work, sadly, so I mainly come here when I'm craving an excellent bowl of Pho.  I love the P7.  I get the large and it's enough to take home for round 2 the next day (I've tried and the flavor is even better left over!).  A bit divey, but the food is solid and keeps me coming back for more.","346":"Wish I could give less than one star. Been here for 30 minutes. Lady at the front counter is horrible at customer service. Very rude. Childish. Never stay here. Go far away!","347":"my friend and i went to this place because it was right in front of us while we were looking for a place to grab a light dinner.  \n\nnot much to look at from the outside but clean and updated on the inside.  i was blown away by the fact that on a wednesday night at 7:30 pm all the tables were full.  our server knew all the dishes and without hesitation told us which were the best.\n\nmy new favorite dish:  Gao Lao Nuer and it was a whopping $7.95.  i even had enough left over for lunch the next day and it was even better heated up!","348":"Best 1\/2# burger. Very friendly. Excellent prices. Memorabilia nice but too much money. Very clean place. I would definitely recommend it. We are from the Temecula area of .CA.","349":"I was lied to about more than one thing on my first and only visit in April. A simple oil change and state inspection with a scheduled appointment is apparently too much for the lazy techs to handle. I wasn't even waiting for my car - I left it for hours.\n\nI was lied to about there being a check engine light on and a code being thrown, and then they claimed they cleared it (without telling me what the code was or calling me) therefore they couldn't do the inspection, nor could I try to remedy whatever was \"wrong\" with my car. My 4 year old car had no check engine light or warning light of any kind when I left it (and drove it there from South Austin) and no code or light ever came on after that (it's been over 3 months now). To top it off, while I was still in their parking lot, OnStar got a clean read off my car and told me no code had been thrown that day. I was also told they drove my car around for a while to see if the light would come back on, but not even ONE mile was added to my odometer. When I told the manager this, he had nothing to say other than the tech \"exaggerated\" how far he'd driven, and wasn't the least bit apologetic. He didn't charge me for the inspection like he should have, so he obviously knew it was a lie. And he made it out like he was doing ME a favor. To top it off, they couldn't even do something as simple as fill the tires with air and reset the oil life percentage.\n\nMy first sign to turn and leave should have been when I was dropping the car off, and when I told the service advisor that the tire quote was too expensive and I couldn't afford it right now, his response was \"of course you can't\". \n\nI don't know if they thought because I was a young looking woman they could take advantage of me or what. But the bottom line is these guys are liars and crooks. Take your business elsewhere.","350":"One of my favorite dispensaries in Portland! Bud quality is solid along w\/gram prices. Paid $10g for some Super Skunk Indica the other day and it did not disappoint! Their pre-rolls are usually great at $6.25 a gram - can't beat that price\/quantity anywhere else! Nice edible  selection as well. The reason I gave 4 stars is due to the cartridge selection. They do have the cheapest prices for Golden 1\/2 g cartridges, but if you're looking for top grade solventless products (which i always am), this is not the place - yet. Aside from that, everything else is great. The budtender's are friendly and helpful, especially Hannah & Whitney, who i have the most contact w\/! Totally chill vibe with good tunes playing in the background. It's the kinda place where you don't feel rushed when you walk in.","351":"Professional & courteous staff. The inside was spacious & clean. The waiting area included Complimentary water & Keurig for coffee. \n\nMy damage was minor, so my estimate didn't take long. I received the estimate in writing later in the day. \n\nIt was painless and the entire time I was there I felt comfortable. \n\nThis location was recommended by Allstate. Because it was, all parts and labor are guaranteed for life.","352":"Balfour has been a wonderful place for elder care in Boulder County. Most of the staff here is so kind and caring. Unfortunately there have been reports of thefts from the residents in the last few months. It is terrible to see the elderly victimized in the place they are supposed to be kept safe, and possibly by the very people who are supposed to be keeping them safe. It is also disappointing to see how these issues are being managed.","353":"Time for an update! \n\nThe lunch and dinner box\/combo prices have gone up (approx. $1.00) since last year, but I still drop in now and then for a meal. \n\nThe sushi rolls remain the largest in town! I quite enjoy the way everything is served. The sashimi comes in nice, thick slices. As I've mentioned, the sushi rolls are easily double the size of regular sushi rolls elsewhere. The ingredients used are all fresh and good. The prices per roll are still OK. \n\nWe also had prawn tempura. Fried nicely. OK price as well. \n\nIt still is a humble place to eat and drink. So, service is OK. Hit or miss at times. There's a super annoying waiter there. Don't know his name, but you'll know him when you see him. He's shorter, wears glasses, speaks in a condescending tone... \n\nRevisiting them now after a year-long \"break\" from this place, I'm convinced that they have kept the quality at an acceptable level, and will continue to see me every now and then.","354":"This is a very good places to catch up on a game of football or basketball with some drinks and awesome wings. The atmosphere is pretty good like a sports bar and their food is also decent. I like their spicy wing flavors of Spicy garlic & Hot wings. \nThe best part is the 65cents\/wing deal on Tuesdays and Thursdays which helps you to enjoy multiple flavors of their wings for cheap. \n\nThe service is pretty good and the waiters are very prompt with refilling the drinks and constantly checking on you to see is anything is needed. They have plenty of TV s and projector screens to see the games from any seating position. A must go for sports lovers to enjoy a game with tasty wings and beer.","355":"Although I love going to breweries, I was apprehensive heading here since it's Saint Patrick's Day weekend and figured the crowd would be way too much to get through. While there was a crowd, the hardest part was just the parking (got lucky).\n\nA free brewery tour, with a guide who actually was incredibly enthusiastic about being there (despite probably repeating the same stuff over and over). The free tastings at the end were generous: 3 5oz samples of their current brewings, refills if there is still some more to go around. Plus a free glass souvenir.\n\nNothing more you can ask for (except maybe food, but some food trucks outside). \n\nGreat host, great crowd, great beer.","356":"We feel like this is the best breakfast place around! Great food, we usually get the lumber jack. The fresh squeezed orange juice is amazing.  Fun 80s music and atmosphere.","357":"I regret giving this dealership our business. Run, as another person said! In December of 2014, we found a vehicle that was perfect for our family. The ad stated that it had a clean CarFax and the document handed to us seemed to reflect this as well. In hindsight, I wonder if they handed me the true CarFax, or one from another vehicle of the same model, or maybe they doctored it with the vin number- one will never know. Fast forward to this past weekend, I found a vehicle that matches what we are looking for and inquired about the details, including trade-in for my current vehicle. The guy calls me back and says, \"well there's a really bad wreck on the CarFax for your vehicle.\" My response, \"well that's interesting, because when your dealership sold me the vehicle, it specifically stated it had a clean CarFax and was never wrecked, as we did ask before making the purchase.\" So then the guy starts back tracking, asking when I got the vehicle (he wanted to act like it was wrecked in our possession). Furthermore, he acts like they'll be doing me a favor to give me about $4,000 under what should be typical trade-in for our vehicle. I'm so disgusted and upset over this whole situation, as a vehicle is a major purchase and I feel completely stupid and taken advantage of by these slimy people.","358":"meh its ok, got my car serviced here. Thinking it was just a oil charge. Didn't really honor my service coupon that I've received. Also stated that both my cabin and engine air filter needed to be changed, when I have personally changed it not to long ago. They claimed that they \"accidentally\" clicked the wrong button. The staff was very nice, although their explanation for my filters makes me think that Beaverton Honda wants to charges you for services that you dont know. Making their business ethics very questionable.","359":"Food probably has potential to be four stars, but the service really killed it for me.  I want to post a picture of the burrito I got and will try to do so soon.  It was blackened all around and I had to tell every person on the line that I want the burrito the way it comes, but they kept asking me what I wanted.\"I want the brisket queso burrito\"..how am i supposed to know what it comes with? you're the one who works here.  Food is probably good, just wish people on the line knew what comes in their burritos, it's one of bob's signature burritos for crying out loud.\n\nUpdate: Please see last photo in the photo library, that is my burned burrito, unaltered, minutes after ordering.","360":"I love Kirklands. I love that as soon as I walk in I'm instantly bombarded with that sweetly overwhelming smell of those famous potpourri packets they sell; you all know what I mean.\n\nIt's really worth stopping by when they've got holiday sales going on. You can find so many beautiful things to furnish your home with at outstanding prices. From little knick-knacks like those same potpourri packets mentioned before (1.99) to furniture and modern decor items. Can you tell I really like their potpourri packets?","361":"I was in the mood for froyo and guess what I bumped into, while walking around downtown Portland?!!!\n\nI'd say this place gets double thumbs up for decor and boba selection!!!\n\nI did wish they had more froyo options. I'd say the selection is too limited. But the positive vibes all around makes up for it!","362":"Pretty great flavors but really lame that we waited an hour in line and there weren't any vegan donuts and we came at 11am during Labor Day weekend.  The girl at the cashier said they ran out of all vegan donuts but strange to me since they were still churning out non-vegan flavors.  We walked away with only a \"Sorry about that, we've been really busy.\"  So much for being vegan friendly.  Maybe we just had a one-off experience but I won't be coming back to this location.","363":"I have only ever had mediocre experiences there. I keep going back hoping for different results. I work in the area and it's the only nail spot that I can get an appointment at with short notice (perhaps that should have been my first indicator that this place isn't all that great) \nI get gel manicures. The nail techs are so aggressive with the filing and buffing that I had to take a 6-month break from having my nails done so they could heal. \nThey aren't at all friendly. They are relatively unprofessional. I could overlook that if the service were better.\nLast time, i thought since it had been almost a year, I would give them another chance. I got a powder dip. The tech seemed annoyed by my choice of service, even though it was $10 more than a gel manicure. She clearly had never done the dip before. (When I asked her she didn't answer) I wish she had told me because I would have just opted for gel. She was aggressive, as usual. She kept asking the girl next to her for instructions. I'm all for helping people learn but be up front about your lack of experience. I also didn't have time to sit there for the two hours it took. Half way through the manicure, I noticed she was using the wrong color but she assured me, it's just the powder that's lighter. They are the wrong color. I wanted to go back the next day to complain, have them removed, and get my money back but I knew that I didn't want them to re-do them. I don't want them to ever touch my hands again. But I know they don't do refunds, only re-dos. A week later, this three week manicure is popping off of my nails. Unacceptable. Spend the extra money and go down the block to Aer Nailbar.","364":"Worst. Fruits and Vegetables are over priced and on top of that the sanitary standards of this place are non-existent. When I heard about this place I was thrilled, it sounded like a nice neighbourhood grocery store, but after being chased out of the place by the shady owner refusing to refund my expired and wrongly priced items I will never step foot in this place again! I laughed off accusations that he got one of the cashiers pregnant, but now I know how sleazy and greeted he really is. On top of that the racist prick followed me and my wife around the store! The staff there are lazy, clueless and just as greedy as he is. It's a bad environment and a waste of my money!","365":"They call the cops on our table and said that we were causing a disturbance here... we were just sitting here with my little brother... but they were favoring other people that had under 18 year olds(a baby) because their ethnicity was Arabic and didn't say anything to them. But what ended up happening was that they had kicked them out as well when we mentioned it to the cops.","366":"To actually go to a Starbucks in a town like Portland with dozens of boutique coffee shop options, you're pretty much going to need the kind of trenchcoat-scarf-sunglasses attire that you would need going into a porno theatre during the afternoon hours. \n\nPeet's strikes a happy middle ground of still causing some locals to scrunch up their faces a little, but without being nearly as shameful. \n\nAnd to be fair, in a sense Peet's isn't really competing for the money that would go to Public Domain. It's competing with the money that would go to Starbucks. In that battle, I say long live Peet's. \n\nI prefer the Peet's version of pretty much everything I might order at Starbucks and would highly encourage more people to take that Pepsi challenge. Also the pastries at Peet's dominate anything you can get at Starbucks.\n\nThis heart-of-downtown Peet's is well-organized and always has ridiculously snappy service. I've seen them caffeinate multiple rowing-teams worth of people some busy mornings with German-transit-like efficiency.  \n\nI've heard the wifi is terrible, but have never tested it. Maybe they've upgraded by now. You'd think they would since they're located in the one part of Portland where you might mistake it for being a city full of business people.\n\nOK, my review is pretty much over, but if you're staying for the snippit at the end: tip these poor baristas more. You think some of them wouldn't rather be working in a 3-person coffee shop with one piece of $200,000 modern art on the wall? Every day they are busting their arses to make a cappuccino you won't be ashamed of if you bump into someone who just came from Cafe Viola. And they're probably trying to save for school. TIP WELL MY FRIENDS. Also, try their almond croissant.","367":"Had a great time and due to the shaded water area, I was actually willing to hang out for hours!  I dread hot summers and this is certainly a good cure.  The many slides and pools kept my 6 and 9 year olds more than content.  The hotel IS 50 plus years old so you will find imperfections.  Overall, considering the price of taking your family to a major water park vs Coco Key...absolutely better prices AND more fun at COCO KEY","368":"I can say I enjoyed our dinner at Ho Ho Chinese BBQ over the weekend.  I feel as though I would need to go a few more times and try different items to provide a more accurate rating.  \n\nWhen we entered, I felt as I was back in Chinatown in NYC.  It had a very authentic feel and was full of patrons ready to enjoy their dinner!  I knew it had to be a good spot when I saw a good 75% of the customers more were Asian (always a good sign :)  We were seated pretty quickly and water was immediately brought out.  We ordered the roasted duck with white rice and the Roasted duck\/BBQ Pork with white rice, which were both surprisingly good!  The portions were generous.  The little one had the fried shrimp with white rice from the limited 3-item \"Kids Menu.\"  She was disappointed when she asked the waitress if they had French fries and\/or Ketchup and the waitress looked at her like she was crazy and abruptly said \"NO.\"  (I know, I know....this is a Chinese restaurant, not corner store fast-food, but still).  She ended up enjoying the shrimp which were fried in Panko and long skewer-style\".  The sweet sauce they brought us, seemed to make the difference.  \n\nSo far I can say that the service isn't solid; they all seemed either stressed, rushed, disengaged, or all of the above.  The food was decent but very limited in variety  I'd like to have more options with a meal instead of just white rice.  Give us some vegetables, some pre-meal freebies like bread or crispy noodles with duck sauce...SOMETHING!   I would go back but definitely wont rush it. \n\nNOTE: (T.M.I. moment).  It could be a coincidence, but the rest of the night and next day I was in the bathroom A LOT.  (just saying)","369":"The Restaurant is great. The Staff is awesome. The food is fantastic. On Wednesdays and Sundays they have mariachis which is very festive. This is a true authentic Mexican restaurant. You have to try it. All their plates are freshly prepared and delicious.","370":"I've had some darn tasty ribs in what used to be a Taco Bell and some really crappy sushi in what was previously a Pizza Hut. So really, when you drive up on a restaurant that's in what used to be ANOTHER fast food joint, you never know what you're going to get. This being said, Golden Gate Restaurant is located in an old Wendy's. However, I'd heard about this place from family and decided to give it a go.\n\nThe restaurant was practically empty when we walked in about 7PM. We were, of course, seated right away and greeted. The menu looked like any other American-Chinese restaurant I've been to... Like, hmmm... Is this going to be another \"lemme throw some sweet red sauce on some fried pork and call it sweet and sour\" place? And yup, the sweet and sour pork was the least impressive thing we ordered. However, the beef with peppers and the spicy beef were actually both really tasty. And the sweetie LOVED the egg roll, which is funny 'cause he's usually a cabbage hater ;-)\n\nGolden Gate averages out to three stars in my mind... Though their decor was less than impressive, the folks working there were super friendly and right on top of everything. A few misses in the food department, but overall pretty tasty stuff. Oh, and a good price to boot.","371":"So disappointing. I have been wanting to try the Ravenous Pig for months so we joined my best friend and his family for his birthday. They raved about the food and being a foodie,  I have heard of James and Julie Petrakis so I was excited.\n\nStarted with the house specialty Old Fashioned. It had bacon, whiskey and maple syrup and since I have previously vowed to never turn that combination down, I ordered it. While it wasn't as unique tasting as I had expected, it was tasty enough. GF got the Cat's Pajamas which was a rum concoction and was pretty good (pretty sweet but that might just be me).\n\nWe decided to start with Gruyere biscuits. I had a pasta dish with rabbit confit. GF had the lasagna. Under normal circumstances, I would have ordered the venison or Pork Porterhouse but I suspected my friend's dad would insist on paying (he did) and didn't want to overdo it.\n\nThe biscuits were good but but lacked any cheesiness or even cheese flavor (maybe a touch of cheese but that is pushing it since the only indication I had that cheese was present was that maybe the texture was creamier). I enjoyed them but didn't meet expectations. My dish had great-tasting pasta and the sauce was light and truffle-ly but very bland. I think it had apricots but they didn't add much and the rabbit tasted like canned tuna fish. GF's lasagna was a different take on traditional lasagna with the noodles cooked, toasted and used kinda like a bowl with the filling in the middle. It tasted good, but it wasn't great. \n\nOther dishes around the table included the snack board, the burger, pretzel appetizer and the scallop appetizer. The entire table felt very underwhelmed and caused those who raved earlier to actually apologize for recommending it. \n\nService was decent as the server wasn't friendly and just kind of did his job. We excitingly asked for a recommendation between a few drinks and he said he hadn't tried most of them and only offered suggestions on whiskey leaving the girls (rum drinkers) to order from the menu. I expect a little more at a restaurant like this; you don't need to drink the entire bar or be a juggling trapeze act but you should act like you want to be there and have a small of variety of suggestions.\n\nI refuse to believe that all of Orlando is wrong about this place. Maybe we just showed up on a bad night but I expected WAAYYY more on my first visit. We will give this place one more shot and I hope I get a taste of what everyone else has experienced.","372":"They've got a pretty unique veggie burger.  It has a strong  garlic flavour and not your every day fixin's. It's topped with baby arugula, which provides a nice buttery freshness and dried fennel that adds a crisp saltiness to each bite. I got the set of three sliders because it's rare to see veggie sliders on a menu and really who can resist those cute little guys?! The patty is crispy on the outside and I like how it isn't just a big indecipherable mush. You can actually see bits of the ingredients like the edamame beans, portabellini mushrooms and tofu. The soft brioche bun is dressed with a really creamy and fresh tasting cilantro aioli. I feel the burger is missing a tart or acidic flavour though, which maybe tomato could provide.  The taste is a little flat since it's dominated by just the strong garlic and salty flavours.  The patty also has goat cheese, so unfortunately it's not vegan. \n\nThis burger comes with fries. No complaints there. What makes the fries really great are their selection of  aioli dips like truffle, miso, chipotle and cilantro  (an extra $2).  I must point out that there is also a deep fried ice cream on the menu (yes DEEP FRIED), if you're looking to go all out. \n\nThis place is located right on Granville Street in late night party central. We went in the daytime on a weekday for lunch and it was pretty busy with the working crowd.  It's not big, but has a very spacious feel with high ceilings and white and metal d\u00e9cor.  I can see how it would get pretty busy in the evening and late night with lots of activity at the bar, which dominates most of the restaurant.\n\nThe service was a bit slow, but not terribly so. Our server apologized several times about the wait and warned us before we ordered in case we were in a rush.  Overall it's pretty casual, at lunchtime at least. We seated ourselves when we arrived.\n\nThere are not many other vegetarian options on the menu other than the salads.  But, for a place that has the following Mark Twain Quote on their website \"Sacred Cows Make the Best Hamburger\", I'm surprised they have a veggie burger at all! (Poor cows!!!) So, all things considered, it's a pretty creative and unique take on the veggie burger.  (No sacred cows were harmed in the writing of this review).","373":"Cask & Larder is located at Orlando airport. We had about an 1:45 mins to catch our next flight. They have a nice space that's kind of broken down into two spots . The main bar overlooking the runway and the main restaurant with a smaller bar next door. \n\nWe seated at the small bar in the main restaurant. This overlooked the open kitchen and became the reason for my 3 stars instead of 4. The waitstaff found this spot to be where they decided to hang out and fool around . I'm not for not having fun at work , but when people are under a time crunch trying to catch a flight it definitely slows thing down. \n\nWe started with the smoked fish dip with a pickle relish served with toast points. The serving was large and we needed more toast points . They said they had to charge us $3 for more . ( ok I guess) . It was quite tasty. \n\nMy wife ordered the shrimp and grits , they were cheese grits served with the key west pink shrimp , and pepper relish. The grits were cooked perfectly and everything was balanced well together. \n\nI ordered the fried chicken sandwich served on a brioche bun . The bun was perfect, light and fluffy. It was served with bread and butter pickles, a slaw and hot honey. The chicken was fried perfect and spiced perfect. It just needed a little spice to balance out the honey . But very tasty.","374":"Each month a different 5-course tasting menu focusing on seasonal items is presented. \n\nThis month was a Panama Canal tour. Cuba, Columbia, Jamaica and Mexico. \nThe El'Cubano first course was AMAZING. Yeah, a cubano sandwich as the first course- - it was a fantastic opener.     Check the website before this tour is gone.\n\nAlsooooo see the website for secret happy hour offerings unlike those of any other restaurant. \n\nReservations for the dining room are a MUST. Git on it EARLY.  \n\nGet on their mailing list so you stay up to date on the monthly focus. Dont miss the hazelnut feature..I hope they do it again. They'll do it again, right? Please say yes.  \n\nAttention: A stair climb to get up to the place.\n\nElegant decor\nComfortable surroundings\nPersonable staff\nBartender (Danny da Bomb)\nGreat old classic bar\n\nMake a new habit and that habit should be Uptown Billiards Club","375":"This is one of our favorite places to take our dog. Great place to have your dog run around leash free or have your dog go out for a swim. The only problem is parking during the weekends; either come early or go during the weekdays. Otherwise, just wait it out and best of luck with parking.","376":"the actual address is just west of the us bank at mlk\/ne alberta...cute little shop, and the man running it is so nice....many chairs on the patio...they serve tillamook ice cream, and it's delicious...saw they made root beer floats too...loved it..thx!","377":"Sadly I can only give this place two stars.  Most of my reviews are positive. So I will start with the positive.  The appetizers were super.  We had bacon wrapped prawns, tuna sashimi, crab stack ( should have been called no crab stack) and a few other small items.  All good.  \nThe service was super.  \n\nSadly the main courses were not.  Not only did I have the smallest piece of Halibut ever but I had to cut it with a knife in a saw like manner.\n\nYes you heard me right.  The portions were horrible for the price and the halibut was atrocious.  Even on Hells Kitchen, their disaster would have been better than the dried piece of fish I had.  With maybe a little pepper on it.  No other seasoning.  I didn't even taste any butter.  What gives?  For a 36 dollar plate, I expect way more than that in quality and yes in proper size.  It was like a cigar tube, dried and tasteless.  Sadly the waiter ran away from our table instead of offering to do something.  Other than a bev and appetizer I most likely will never go back.","378":"OK. Two experiences here that warrant mentioning:\n\n1. NBA Finals, Game 6.\n\nCeltics are about to win the whole goddarned thing. Everyone's happy. Except the bartender. He was a turd. He didn't tell me how much the pitcher was, and it turned out I only tipped him by a quarter. MY BAD. But then I asked him for two more glasses and he said, \"YEAH, How about I get you a couple glasses when you leave me a [curse word] tip!\"\n\nMy bad dude. I don't think anyone has actually tipped 25 cents since WWII. Clearly an accident. Here's two bucks, and I'll be sure to never encounter you again.\n\n2. Pabst Blue Ribbon\n\nI ordered a pitcher of Killian's (What can I say? I have expensive taste.). Bartender (this one was not a turd by any means) says, \"Oh man, sorry, I just ran out of Killian's.\" I say, \"Oh, that's cool,\" as I browse for other cheap beers among the seemingly thousands of options. PABST!\n\n\"I'll have a pitcher of Pabst then,\" I say.\n\nBartender fills pitcher of Pabst.\n\n\"That's 15 dollars.\"\n\n\"Umm...really? OK....\"\n\nI started sweating, shaking and crying all at once. I think I've paid $15 dollars for Pabst in my whole life, and that probably includes 90 cans.\n\nI walked outside and saw a giant sign in the Blanchard's window: \"Pabst Blue Ribbon: 30-pack. $14.99\"\n\nThe point is...PBR can simply not cost that much. Not here, not now, not ever.\n\nPool was fun though!","379":"Another restaurant  with consistently good food and service. It was 8pm on a Monday night so it was easy to get on street parking and a table. I wouldnt attempt it on a Friday or Saturday night as its always crowded.  \n\nOur cocktails were good. My warm spinach salad and calamari were tasty and plentiful altho they could have been warmer. My companions pork shank was yummy as well. \n\nThe decor is simple and tastful altho the noise level on a busy night gets pretty loud.  There is a bar area where you can stand while you wait for a table. Also many funky  shops along this stretch of Congress Ave to kill time in while you wait.\n\nStaff is always friendly and knowledgable. Prices are reasonable for lunch or dinner. I've not had breakfast or brunch here yet. Fashionable casual to business attire.\nIf you can find a place to park, to try this establishment.","380":"This place was ok. Just needed a cheap place to stay the night so this definitely fit what we needed. The room was on the warm side so luckily the air conditioner in the room worked wonderfully! This place is older so the walls were paper thin and we could hear people in the room next door talking and doors closing all night. We were on the first floor, but I understand there is no elevator to get to the 2nd floor. The shower head was a little on the lower side (I'm 5'3) but the water temperature was superb. The toiletries left for us included shampoos conditioner and 3 soap bars, all from an eco-friendly company that doesn't test on animals (a big win for me!). The bathroom door was metal and VERY difficult to open and close (literally had to pull as hard as a could and have somebody push from the other side to get the door to open after a shower!). There was no fan for the shower so it got VERY steamy in the bathroom and the light switch is randomly out by the doorway to enter the room! There was holes around the ceiling light in the bathroom as well. This location may have a rodent problem too, as we saw a rodent repellant device plugged into a light. There was a fridge, coffee maker, and microwave (the microwave had electrical outlets in the front?), none of which we used. The television only had 7 channels that worked and there were weird waves that traveled across the screen the entire time. The continental breakfast was subpar to say the least. My oatmeal tasted stale and a mini muffin was rock hard. The danishes were tasty, but the orange juice was VERY watered down. Probably won't stay there again and only recommend if you just need a bed to sleep in.","381":"This place lives up to the reviews. If you are at ATL, eat here. Loved the cocktails and the food. Our server, Jason, was absolutely wonderful! Will return if ever back in town.","382":"Secret Vessel joins Blue Top Asian Fusion & Jiu Thai as part of a new cohort of Chinese restaurants in Columbus with young owners and a fair amount of style.  At Secret Vessel, the draw is hot pot; while they're not the first Chinese restaurant in Columbus to offer hot pot (Imperial Garden has been doing so for the last ten years or so), they're the only one to exclusively serve hot pot, with the exception of a few appetizers.\n\nThere are four broth styles you can choose from - a 'classic' broth, Sichuan-style, tomato, and Hong Kong satay-style - and you have the option of selecting two or even all four for your meal.  There's a range of proteins, mushroom (unfortunately translated as 'fungus'), tofus, and vegetables as well.\n\nWe selected two broths, the Sichuan-style and the classic; they came out in a pot shaped like a donut, with the classic broth in what would be the donut hole.  Unfortunately, the classic broth never really got to boil, even when the Sichuan broth was fiercely boiling.  We had the house-made chicken meatballs for protein, plus a plate of assorted fungus (a mix of button, oyster, enoki, & eringi mushrooms), a plate of assorted vegetables (Napa cabbage, iceberg lettuce, wintermelon cubes, small chunks of corn on the cob, and potato slices), and a plate of Northern-style wheat noodles.\n\nIn general the selections were fresh and good quality; kudos for the housemade chicken meatballs, which were small balls of ground chicken with corn kernels mixed in.  The sauce bar had a nice range of things to make your dipping sauce, although some of the bowls were empty by the time we started eating (at 8PM on a Sunday night).\n\nAll in all, it was a pretty nice meal.  The range of options was good, and the Sichuan-style broth held up pretty well against my memories of Sichuan hotpot on the streets of Chongqing (minus the heat, humidity, and air pollution).  The downside was the price of the meal; for two of us, our bill was $70 with tip included, and we're not big eaters.  That's a pretty hefty price to pay for hot pot, even in the US.  That much money would have fed twice as many people at either Blue Top or Jiu Thai, and at Secret Vessel you're doing most of the cooking yourself!\n\nHopefully the owners of Secret Vessel will realizing their price point is a little high for their market, because it's a nice little place and a nice addition to Columbus' Chinese food scene.","383":"Stumbled upon this place by accident last year when we got hungry on our way to Salt and Straw, and what a happy accident! In a city full of good Thai food, I'll still make the trek over here on occasion. The first time we went, our waitress was very kind, explaining the specials and giving us recommendations - all of which proved to be good. The food was delicious, and brought to us quickly. I got the salad rolls as an appetizer, and even shared between 4 people, there was plenty to go around. Every dish that each of us got was delicious, and my boyfriend and I have since made it a point to come back often. There is no MSG in the food, and the decor is beautiful. It's not the trendiest restaurant in the area, but if you're looking for delicious food and attentive service at a reasonable price, this is the place to be. Bonus: the lunch time massaman curry over rice noodles is to die for.","384":"My boyfriend keeps on insisting us to eat here everytime I come up to Austin but I was never a fan of burgers until I came here. \n\nWe came at 1 on a Friday afternoon in August. Yes, it was around 90 degrees. Scorching hot !! The wait, yes, was about 20-30 minutes. On the bright side, they kindly gave out paper fans, water, and alcohol for those who wanted to order some. Even though it was just a party of two, we still had to wait in line. Finally, after nearly 40mins of waiting in lines after lines, we finish ordering and were waiting for our burgers. \n\nWe both ordered the Magic Shroom mushrooms. I had mine with an avacado and my boyfriend's had an egg on his. The burger was DELICIOUS. The flavor was overwhelming !! I've never had such an amazing burger before. This place puts fast food burgers to shame. I never want to eat a burger unless it's from HopDoddy LOL. \nI had to struggle abit trying to fit the my mouth on the burger and gave up and went with my knife and fork haha.  \nMy Raspberry & White chocolate smoothie was on point ! So cool and sweet. \n\nIn total, our two burgers, fries, and two milkshakes came out to be around 25 dollars. Definitely have to come here again ! But probably not on a weekend hahaha.","385":"Went there for a friend's bday celebration. First off, waitress was hard to find and it was on a weekday afternoon!! The first lane they gave us had issues with it. The ball doesn't return and the lane gets locked up. That should have gotten Jillian's a 2 star but the big reason I gave 1 star was what I saw in the bathroom...cockroach climbing up my stall as I was doing the business...and you should know that the service kitchen is right across from the bathrooms on the bowling level.","386":"Really surprised nobody has Yelped this place yet.\n\nParking is available in the lot on the S side of the building.\n\nThe location is 24h, which is also good to know.\n\nAlthough the front side of the building looks wide, this location is freaking TINY because the depth is very low.  I think there are no more than 10 tables in the entire place.  Some people's living rooms are larger than this.  Because of the lack of space, the counter area is also really cramped. I can imagine this place being a gong show during peak hours.","387":"I have been to Bay Moorings a handful of times throughout my life and I can't say I've ever had a particularly good experience. Food is mediocre and prices are high. They seem to be trying to skate by on their location with minimal effort. I have been here for personal dining experiences as well as a very large birthday gathering. The large party was honestly a disaster, and took place last year. Service is notoriously bad as the servers just don't seem to want to be there or care about your experience at all. There are better restaurants in the area, and until Bay Moorings steps their game up it's not worth the visit.","388":"I have been taking my pets here for over 3 years, and despite moving to Easton (south of Quincy by about 30 miles), I STILL make the 45 minute drive to take my pets to Dr. Wember. \n\nThe entire staff is knowledgable, caring, compassionate and I always feel I am getting the absolute best care for my \"dog kids\" when we visit. I have even stopped in without an appointment with a minor emergency and they've put me in right away without hesitation.\n\nTheir fees are also extremely reasonable and I never feel as though I'm being \"taken for a ride\" or taken advantage of. I feel as though the staff genuinely cares about their well-being and health and not the amount of money they can make off them.\n\nLong story short: Best vet ever.","389":"Let me start by saying I was raised on homemade chicken soup and  I now live in Brookline, so perhaps I have high standards. I know that chicken soup varies, and I appreciate the effort to modernize it, especially if that means making it healthier, but the soup I had at Mamaleh's did not taste like chicken soup at all. It tasted like hot water with salt and cardboard. I couldn't eat it. I also had a knish, which was meh. To me knishes are a delicious treat, but this one was dry and bland and not worth the calories. If I'm going to indulge, I want the real things. We sat at a small side table and we were ignored ... it was a long wait for both service and soup ... and it was not worth it. \n\nI recommend you (gulp!) cross the river and brave the traffic to Brookline ... where you'll find  Zaftig's, Mike's Deli, and authentic bagels at Kupel's. I'm sorry to say that there aren't as many Jewish delis as there used to be, so the ones that are still here will appreciate your business and prove it by providing better service.\n\nIf you'd like to stay on the Cambridge side, go to S&S deli.\n\nP.S. One review calls Mameleh's a kosher deli. It is NOT kosher. Perhaps this reviewer meant kosher-style.","390":"I went in here only briefly with my friend on his birthday to get a free shot.  They didn't give him a  free shot.  I guess he bought one anyway. \n\nThere was a terrible country rock band on the stage. \n\nThis is where frat guys and middle-aged men who can't get laid go when they've given up all hope.","391":"Made me feel like I didn't know anything... Which the first sentence I said was... \"I don't know anything about cars.\" Kept cancelling on me AFTER my car was there, somehow made me feel bad. Oh.. And they told me to call next Wednesday to see if they had time for me. And when my car was done, no one called me so I ended up calling and the lady at the desk just said ya it's done.... Okay? That's it? Never again.","392":"Very good panang curry, although service was odd. The waitress started off friendly enough but after we received our meals she seemed very agitated. I don't remember anything that would've caused her to be upset. Towards the very end of our dinner she disappeared completely and a gentleman took care of our to go boxes. He was nice. I'd probably go back for lunch because the parking situation at night is horrible.","393":"For some weird reason their website warns that pickles are not currently available. Uh, what?\nUPDATE- They have pickles. Whew! Close one.","394":"I enjoyed the wine.  I did a tasting and liked it all.  The ladies were friendly.  Met one of the owners and she took her time to tell us about the vineyard and the process of harvesting grapes from their vines. I bought wine and joined the wine club.  I look forward to my first club order to come in.","395":"A great coaching staff, thats helpful and motivating are only just the beginning of what makes Forever Crossfit such a gem.  Crossfit can be intimidating and the community, facility and instruction all play major parts in not only gaining confidence in the workouts, but also committing to a new more fit lifestyle.\n\nIf you are looking to try something new, or even  just enhance your level of fitness Forever Crossfit is a premier place to find people both new and experienced working hard, getting great results and having fun.  Definitely a 5 star location.","396":"Visiting from out of state and my sisters and I were craving Cajun style seafood.  So as usual I yelp eateries to get an idea where I should eat at. Food was ok, clams were a little dry and shrimp was a little cold and not because we waited to eat it. Lemon must have not come with it nor was it offered.  I mean if I am comparing to Cajun seafood restaurants in So. California, I would not recommend  this place. Our server was not friendly and service was slow or maybe because she was the only waitress scheduled?! I did read yelp reviews before deciding on this place and wanted to give them a try...but seriously I'm all about customer service and really I should give this place 2 stars!","397":"My friends and I came here for a dinner on NYE, expecting an amazing dinner to take us into the new year. Negative on that. There are far too many other restaurant options in the city to settle for mediocre and overpriced.\n\nI had the crab cakes and the lasagna -- crab cakes were fart too salty, but the lasagna was great. My friends had oysters and steaks and all enjoyed it. Even so, I don't think this place will become a favorite anytime soon. While the ambiance is cozy and inviting, allowing for conversation and a somewhat intimate setting, the food wasn't anything special. \n\nNow, onto the worse part. CHEAT ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU. CHEAT ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU AGAIN AND I'M NEVER COMING BACK. As I looked over our bill, I found that our waiter put 8 desserts and a tea on our bill that we hadn't ordered. When I called it out, he went to fix it. Only to come back with a bill with maybe 3 desserts we hadn't ordered. I mean, maybe it was a computer error, but I still don't appreciate being billed for a ton of food we hadn't ordered. And having to call it out TWICE. I'm not sure if the waiter was trying to pull one over on us with a fluffed up bill, but he definitely wasn't the best, so I wouldn't be surprised. \"You guys aren't splitting the bill all equally? Alright, who's the cheapskate?\" I'd laugh. Maybe if he hadn't tried to overcharge us. TWICE :T.\n\nFor the price tag vs. quality of service and food...I don't think I'm going to be Rendezvous-ing again anytime soon. I left with an overly salty taste in my mouth from the crab cakes and a bad taste in my mouth from the service...","398":"Obviously a great selection of Vegan food but not worth the poor customer service. My husband and I have been here a handful times and none of them were a positive experience. It's really not that hard to be nice people.","399":"We go here a lot after practices, games, etc.  usually it's the drive through.  Today we went in and they have an employee there (Lisa) that is a great breath of fresh air from the norm at a fast food restaurant.  She is pleasant and seems to actually care about providing great service.  She even came around and asked people how their meals were and if she could clear tables.  We will definitely be back to this location.","400":"shaun at more home slice is awesome and they have really good pizza too go on Monday for their Sicilian!!!","401":"HOly crap this place is super creative and modern! Everything from the presentation of their sushi rolls to their decor spells out C-H-I-C. Not only that, the sushi\/sashimi here are also very fresh. Price is also reasonable for the area. This is an amazing place for a date or a girls night out. I promise you will not be disappointed! Overall I had a great experience here and you have to try the Chanel roll.","402":"Having been back from Greece only a few weeks, I was a bit unsure when my friend told me she made rez here for my visit...  Well, I felt transported back to my honeymoon.  Everything on the menu was exactly as I remembered it in Santorini - the dips, salads, meats - all incredible!","403":"I am a personal trainer and I believe in the benefits of hands-on tissue work and myo-fascial release. I have had several deep tissue massages, but this is something completely different. Never before have I seen and felt such a dramatic difference after a single session. After I rose from the table I stood taller and straighter. My movement felt more fluid and my breathing improved. I am so excited to continue my 10-series. Diana is incredibly skilled and she can truly read your body. If you value your body at all, book a visit today. This is transformative.","404":"This place is fun for a big or small group. The food is good and the view is nice. It is VERY casual and the tables and chairs are picnic style. The servers are...okay. The prices aren't terrible for the seaport but if you are looking for a nice place, this is not for you!","405":"Good assortment of dairy free that actually taste really good. Employees were patient and let us try almost everything.","406":"Very expensive, you have to use the produce right away or it goes bad,  tried to find butter here once.. that was funny.. there was none.. i saw buttery spread.. but no butter..  also went in one time to get bacon and eggs for breakfast.. somehow when i left I had paid over 8.00 for it.   wtf!?!?!?!","407":"The food here is really good, but the service is horrible. I've been there twice. 1st we had the skirt stake and the lengua tacos, which were really good but the server was so rude that kind of ruined the experience...2nd time, we waited 30 minutes until we had to stand up and ask to be served and once again server was super rude and did not care at all that we waited for 30 min. At the end actually walked out and went to another one of the awesome places in downtown Sanford. This place could be really good if they improve their service.","408":"This is hands down the best buffet in Austin. I've never had a bad meal here. Everything is pretty tasty but the highlights are the galbi (on weekends), the seafood salad, chicken wings, terriyaki chicken, dumplings, veggie fritters, Jap chae, and the sushi is pretty good for buffet sushi (which is not an easy accomplishment). I've been coming here for over 11 years and it's always a good experience. Service is good even when they are busy. The bathrooms could be a little better, as partitions in the men's room stalls are falling apart. There's lots of good dessert there too, including pies, cakes, ice cream, and cobbler, all of it looks appealing and fresh.","409":"It's awesome \nMy birthday and the Bloody Marys are amazing\nThe oysters were fabulous and I can not recommend this place enough\nStaff friendly and cool","410":"Very fun bar with a circus game theme.  There's a slide inside which is fun. Magnetic letters next to the tables. Back outdoor area. Very fun scene that is usually busy with great music. Young crowd. Would definitely come again.","411":"Love love love this place. Everything was delicious and the service was so friendly. Dont come here if you're in a hurry, but im pretty sure all the food is made fresh to order. Their cornbread is not to be missed!","412":"This is the best Japanese restaurant in Austin. Don't judge the book by its cover. Just because it is inside the mall does not mean it is not good. I eat here once a week - drive from North Austin- and every time the food is delicious. Give it a try!!!! Strongly recommend.","413":"Wow- great macarons and croissants.","414":"I really liked Seven Lamps. Had dinner there last Friday night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Good atmosphere, albeit, a little loud inside. If you want to have a conversation, best to ask for a table outside.\n\nReally enjoyed the food, the mussels were awesome! The cocktails are very creative and they have a very decent wine list. Was tempted to try the secret menu hamburger, but after appetizer and mussels couldn't fit anymore in the belly!","415":"Has a very scetchy booting company working for them. Came here with my dog, and took him to the tree on the immediate sidewalk to do his business. Less than 5 minutes after exiting the restaurant, i come back to a boot on my car. Alerted the police and showed my reciepts but officers said it was a civil matter and could not get involved. The guy parked next to me walked across the street and back and he was booted as well within 5 minutes of my car being booted. Hope this meal is worth $75. This isnt the first ive heard of this place doing this but now im a believer.","416":"Hub of Frozen Vegetables is probably how you can aptly describe Bombay Bistro. Navaratan Korma or vegetable biriyani has the same frozen Mediterranean blend that you get in HEB. This is the only restaurant that does this and it totally spoils the taste of that curry as well as biriyani (By the way who uses zucchini in a biriyani!!). The sight of crinkled cut carrots is a testament of that!\n\nThe kheema Naan was good(3\/5), but was a bit burned on the outside. The lamb biriyani was also decent(4\/5). That is why I am giving three stars. \n\nOverall, my view is just visit this place for meat related items and non-mixed-vegetable items.","417":"First off, coming from California where sushi restaurants are abundant, I was hoping that Haiku would live up to the quality found near the Pacific coast.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the seaweed salad, Harvest roll, and chirashi. The Harvest roll was tasty but the chirashi was disappointing. I chose chirashi to rate the quality of the fish served here. The quality wasn't great but wasn't terrible either - the fish didn't taste very fresh and I did not like how little sashimi was given. I did fancy the mushrooms though.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was nice and would be great for dating, but the service was extremely slow and unfriendly. Our waitress seemed to just want us to quickly eat and leave even though it wasn't busy at all.\n\nOverall, Haiku serves decent sushi that is slightly overpriced with subpar service.","418":"Decide to treat my daughter for her 20th birthday. View was great! Waiter not friendly at all. Didnt even ask us if we wanted coffee. Orange juice was an additional 6 dollar for a 42 dollars brunch (should be included). Nothing like paying 200 dollars for over cooked cold eggs. Do yourself a favor and go to a restaurant that is selling quality food and not a view.","419":"I have been spoiled. Living in Arizona, we don't get very fresh seafood, especially oysters. We ordered a dozen oysters (not sure which ones.) They were medium size, plump and so so divine. We also ordered a lobster roll to share and it was super tasty. Not drenched in mayo and the roll was tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside. We ordered a great french chard that went perfectly with them as well! The server was very attentive without being overbearing. Will be back next time I am in Boston!","420":"This was awesome!! Loved the location.  Food was excellent!!! Enjoyed the Crescent Ave. vibe.","421":"2 Stars because our waitress was great but could have easily been 1 or 0 stars because of the food.\n\nThe food was so bland and blah. No flavor no spicy kick no nothing! I've had mayo that was spicier than the food I was served here.   It's sad that I'd rather go to Taco Bell instead of come back here. \n\nAnd there's definitely no better music choice for a Mexican Restaurant than country music! Which is what I got to listen to during my entire dining experience.  They even sprinkled in a little bit of Fallout Boy!  Wow.","422":"Ordered delivery last night around 7 pm ordered a small cheese pizza and an order of spaghetti n meatballs for the kids. Pizza was raw and severely undercooked and I'm not sure what they did or what f they changed the usual papa Ginos sauce but the sauce on the spaghetti tasted like Prego it was the worst 27$ I've ever spent I am so","423":"I want to like it... mostly because it is directly across from my work. But I can't. The pizza is alright, nothing special but it gets the job done. The pasta always makes me sick. It sits like a rock in my stomach.","424":"I went to Lucky Strikes for my birthday with a group of 8 people and had an amazing time.  The service from beginning to end was spot on.  I got there around 8:15pm and put my name in for one lane.  It was nice have everyone together in one lane (slowed things down a bit and had some laughs all squished in together).  They said it would be an hour wait (ended up being an hour and twenty minutes) so we headed over to the bar.  The bar is very spacious.  It is a great set up for big groups of people.  Once we started bowling the wait service started serving our drinks.  We never had to wait for her and we never got the wrong order.  She actually sent over a \"Happy Birthday Cake\" shot...delious!  All and all a great night.","425":"The only reason I came here is because my boyfriend loves it. He hyped it up so much that when I tasted the food, I was let down. Then again I've only been once and only tried three dishes, so this review isn't that fair across the board. If I go again, I'll update this. I absolutely love Chinese food and have had it all across Asia, so maybe my standards were too high for this place.\n\nThe fried rice cakes and shredded pork was ok, a little too greasy, and the rice cakes were a little undercooked for me. The soup dumplings which I thought this place was famous for were seriously nothing exciting. They weren't huge and they weren't the best I've ever had.\n\nPlus, parking's horrible. The service was really good though and the food came quickly. I might have to go back and give the place another chance, maybe order other things or go for dinner.\n\nPros: quick service\nCons: quality of food\nVerdict: I wasn't blown away but maybe I'll give this place a try again, considering many past reviewers really love this place.","426":"I crave Mongolian every once in a while. I love the make your own stir fry bar! It's the only reason I go. They also have sushi but not a huge fan of that. Their wontons are good too. Service is slow on drinks but that's fine. It's low key slow environment, doesn't bother me. It's quiet and relaxing.","427":"I just discovered this place tonight. My boyfriend is out of town, and not around to make dinner. And I have an exam tomorrow. What's a girl to do... I tried eating a bag of chocolate buttons (and I mean like a proper sized bag, not the smaller \"one serving\" size stuff).... but instead of being less hungry, I felt slightly sick, slightly sugar high, and still wanting some meat. Raw fish? Yes please. \n\nI am pretty sure the salmon in my appetizer nigiri thing was wild salmon. Dark red, fresh, delicious. Also got a gomae which was pretty good. I've paid a lot more for sushi that wasn't nearly as good. This is defs our new quick dinner spot. Much better than the place on 8th and burrard. Try it! \n\nNot only do I feel better, but I also have managed to further procrastinate studying by coming on to write this! Yay!\n\nBTW the menu is on urbanspoon: http:\/\/www.urbanspoon.com\/r\/14\/181732\/restaurant\/Kitsilano\/The-Sushi-Bar-Vancouver","428":"I lived in Spain and I liked the Tapas...though quite pricey but the Paella was awful...almost like soup with raw rice...not al'dente  raw and the most wonderful thing about paella in Spain was the crunch on the bottom of the pan with the light fluff of rice (not overcooked) melded together.  I did not have true paella here.  Sorry. i really was looking forward to it.","429":"I know other reviewers have given this place high marks so I may have just had a bad experience there.  I'll also so I may just have incredibly high standards bc when I started brewing a few yrs back I was out in MI and we went to an amazing place with a guy who really knows his stuff and has great recipes.\n\nI had a number of issues with this store.  \n\n1)The guy working there when I was in didn't seem to know a thing about brewing, as in had probably never even done it.\n\n2) It was DIRTY.  Beer brewing is a messy endevor at times but I don't like seeing dust and crap on the floor esp not near the malt containers.\n\n3) Bad recipes.  All the recipes I've made from here have turned out mediocre, it could be that the water here isn't as good as it was in MI, but I usually purify it or buy bottled water to use (fyi water is the most important ingredient in beer re: flavor).\n\nSo if you want to break in beer brewing or even if you're an accomplished brewer don't start here.  Check out homebrewing.org, it's the MI store's website.  They have great recipes and they ship anywhere.\n\nUpdate:  I continue to be disappointed by this place.  The people there either know nothing or are snobs who think they know everything (but often don't).  I'd warned a friend of mine about this before the last time we went, and after we left, he gave me the funniest look and said \"ok dude, you were totally right I dunno wtf is up with that place.\"","430":"This place is pretty cool. I went on a Wednesday. They had a live band, margaritas half off before 8 and they provide free salsa lessons. That was fun. Our waiter was nice as well. The only issue I had was the food portions. Don't go to this place if you are starving. But if you are on a barely eat kind of diet, then this place is perfect for you! The food taste EXCELLENT!!! I ordered the lamb. It doesn't come with any sides. Just the 3 tiny little lamb chops. I was still hungry so then i ordered something else. I would go there again but I have to make sure I eat before go come to this place to eat smh. This would have been an easy 5 stars from me but I left still hungry.","431":"After stops at multiple other shops I did some research and found New Rose.  Good reviews led me in the door and my consultation with Xavier got me to come back.  Xavier is personable and professional as well as being damned good at what he does.  I had a vague idea for how I wanted to cover up an older tattoo and walked me through some of the technical considerations and suggested some design areas to think about.  With his feedback I came up with a design that was not only awesome but met Xavier's recommendations for making the cover up work.  And boy did it.  \n\nThe old tattoo is now totally hidden and new one looks awesome.  It was appx an 8hr (in the chair) project over three visits and I'm very happy with the finished product.  Xavier takes a lot of pride in his work and it shows.  Crisp lines, perfectly blended colours, and realistic shadings.  I can't recommend NRT and Xavier enough.","432":"Clean, great service, and a good spot for an early bird dinner after a day at the beach (around 3:30-4pm no wait). I'm definitely a fan. Their clam chowder and hush puppies were awesome. If you like shrimp, of course they've got rock shrimp galore and cooked different ways. If you are looking for fish, they have mahi and mullet on the menu, but they do mostly shellfish. Local Playalinda beer on draft and OBP, some others too. The decor is so neat and the place is much bigger than expected.","433":"The food here is so yummy! the flavor is close to Indian food (obviously) but a bit lighter on the spices (which I like) and a bit more unfamiliar (since Nepalese food is not easy to find around here) in a good way. The desserts are excellent! They're very similar to desserts you can get from any Indian grocery stores, but 10 times better :) Love this place!","434":"BRASS KNUCKLE! Yum!!! I order it whenever I see it on tap. If Humulus Nimbus from Seventh Son is on tap too, it's a really tough call. Finally got a chance to go to the Four String tasting room. It's tight quarters, but definitely great to get to try everything they have to offer instead of hoping the bar you go to will have a decent selection.","435":"The cashier is rude. Horrible customer service. He was rude and short with me. And did not allow me to simply add veggies to my bamboo chicken which is a simple request.","436":"I wish there was a 3.5 stars available. \n\nI love seafood so we have been here a couple times since there's aren't too many solid seafood options in the are. The food is fairly good but not amazing and not great value. \n\nWe have had various items from their bacon wrapped scallops to black and blue shrimps and haddock and crab cakes. It all tastes fine but really could be stepped up. Crab cakes had way too much breeding and very little crab. Salad was smothered in a very sweet dressing. I would really like to see them step it up with the food. \n\nIt's a really cozy and quaint inside and service was fine.","437":"I love their happy hour menu, and the dinner & drink selection is equally delicious. This is a great place to meet a group of friends. The atmosphere is spicy and inviting. The last time I was there I tried the pear salad and it was tasty, and the wine selection is pleasing!","438":"Pretty terrible tonight. Ordered the fish and chips. They looked like Van Dr Kamps fish mushy between batter and fish to boot. They were literally that frozen fish triangle shape. ( I ate 1 and left the rest ). Wife ordered the gyro that was crispy through more than fifty percent of the meat. This was a $40 meal worth maybe $7.","439":"I had an awful pasta dish here many months ago and I'm still traumatized. The grilled pork rib Mezzalune was probably the worst restaurant meal I've had in Atlanta. The rigatoni and meat and cheese plate were good. But I just can't forget about that horrible pasta dish.","440":"These guys have the start of something really good. I hope they can find their own place with a real kitchen. The food (pulled pork, jerk chicken, okra, grits, mac and cheese) was tasty but suffered somewhat from having been cooked earlier and then reheated. \n\nThe atmosphere is awfully weird too, in the bottom floor of the bookstore.","441":"Strawberry almond is very good. 4 stars. Their ice frozen yogurt thing was ok 3 stars. Chocolate almond bad 2 stars. Service 3 stars.","442":"The location is kinda strange for such a lovely little restaurant. If not for the Yelp reviews I don't think I would have ever heard about it. I'm very lucky I did. \n\nI had the gnocchi here, which I tend to order when I see it on a menu. I've been disappointed in the gnocchi from several places around town. However I was not disappointed with it here. The fontina cream sauce was really very good. It was a heavy meal and I only ate about half of it. My boyfriend had the seafood special and it was quite good as well. The service was very pleasant. \n\nAll in all Andiamo is a charming restaurant hidden in a less than charming strip mall.  \n\n[Side note: Recipes often say to substitute mozzarella for fontina if you can't find the fontina - this is a lie and a mistake. I think Andiamo's fontina cream sauce is a great example of why. ]","443":"Came here for a wax, and they did a decent job, but the attention to detail and taking it slow were actually what made this the most painful waxing I've ever had. Normally to get a wax, you grin and bear it for 15 minutes and you're done. I stayed there for over an hour while they pulled out a couple hairs at a time - slow torture. I got the feeling they didn't want to hurt me, but of course that's unavoidable, so it's better to just get it over with! I asked if we could go faster, but no luck. They seemed inexperienced, and really in need of guidance or training. And in the end it was the same result as a fast job, and slightly more expensive. They were really nice and the place seemed clean, but they clearly had no idea how to wax.","444":"In Austin, writing a bad review of Maudie's gives some folks enough reason to hunt chew down an keel ya, but I gotta do it.\n\nNow this is not aimed at the Brodie location specifically, it applies to the chain in general.   Here are a few reasons I think this is one of the more highly overrated places in town:\n\n(-)  What the fuck is wrong with the cheese at Maudie's?  It melts at room temperature, and that's just not right.\n\n(-)  Here's what you get when you order a \"vegetarian taco:\" a pile of slimey \"grilled\" poblano, bell peppers, and onions wrapped in a tortilla.  Where in Tex-Mexico does anyone eat a pepper wrap?  Is this a real food?  It's just wrong. \n\n(-) Again, what the fuck is wrong with the cheese?  A sherbert orange blend of chemicals fashioned into a grated shred shape.\n\nMy one kudo is (+) Maudie's convenient locations make it a desperate 'must' after a can't-drive-more-than-5-blocks-or-I-might-throw-up night of heavy drinking.  A hybiscuria and Pete's tantalizing taco is sometimes the only feel-good.  For that reason alone, I give Maudie's a star above \"crap.\"","445":"I don't know why my coworkers and I continue to go here.  maybe it's the 15% discount and it and Bertucci's are the only walkable options for lunch.\n\nThe food is mediocre at best, the staff is occasionally stuck up (like last Friday), and the prices are ridiculous for what you get (I assume the Jasper White name?).\n\nSeriously, if Legal Seafood bought the old Ground Round (I'd highly advocate this), Summer Shack would be hard pressed to stay open.\n\nEven the booths are ripped up and repaired with duct tape.  I don't know if that's to make it look quaint or what, but it is gross.\n\nEverything is greasy and the salads are watery.  The fries are maybe third tier.  The desserts are pretty good, but not good enough to offset the meal.  The cornbread is okay, but always tastes slightly off.","446":"The broccoli slice is worth any headache in parking! A must try! Staff is really friendly, gave us fresh basil for free. Overall, nice joint -dynamite pizza. Will be back for thirds!","447":"I have never felt so disrespected at a business before. My boyfriend and I opened a PO Box here online and we had to go in and show ID and proof of residency and the form clearly said car registration could be used but MICHELLE proceeded to tell us we were wrong and argue with us rudely. Rude enough that we closed our box there and are going somewhere else.","448":"I really like this place. Its consistent. Very busy at lunch time and easy in the evenings and weekends. Want a good, good-priced burger? This is your place. BUT I have had a problem here twice with a burger's best friend - the fries! While they are usually delicious and fresh cut, but when I get the last of the bunch they are3 disgusting, hard and yuck. Once I had to be a fry snob and ask for a do-over thinking it was an anomaly. Today, same thing. Farm Burger needs to set consistent expectations with the chefs and the servers on french fry quality standards. The patrons and the burgers and that freaking awesome ketchup will appreciate it.","449":"Oooooh, je t'aime, Ten Ten! Every meal I've had here has been delish, fun and reasonable...can you beat that? The escargot is some of the absolute best I have ever had... garlicky and packed with tasty little mushrooms that soak up the broth perfectly (I'd not had escargot that incorporates 'shrooms before) ...oh, yum and likely to induce addictive dipping. \nI think you can often measure the quality of a place by how they manage the classics and the steak frites and brique poulet are TDF (that's \"to die for.\") The salade simple is a favorite too, as is the one that is like a reconstructed version of a ceasar. Tasty treats-","450":"I went to this place after my friend suggested it for dinner as a going away event. And my god, was it good. \n\nWe had one of the pork sandwiches and wow. The flavor was so amazing. I couldn't stop eating it and it was quite amazing. \n\nWe also had the platter, him with the chicken and I with the shredded beef. It also came with bean and rice, fried plantains, and a little lettuce with tomato. I mixed the beans with the rice and lettuce and each bite kept me feeling good and was so delicious. I wanted to keep eating and eating. \n\n\nI didn't even eat dessert because the portions was so big! I plan to come back a few more times to try the other sandwiches and their other popular items. \n\n\nThe food was great. The service was questionable as our waitress seem to disappear. However, it was quite packed, and the deliciousness overshadowed any other lack of quality with the restaurant.","451":"Meh. I've experienced better. Food was decent but the service was slow and generic.","452":"I came here on a whim after getting out of South Station on my way to work. I was hungry and craving for viet sandwich pronto. I ordered the BBQ Beef sandwich since the two customers in front of me had ordered the BBQ Beef sandwich. I was slightly hesitant to order the beef since I have never seen beef on a viet sandwich before.\n\nI usually order a BBQ chicken or the standard pork viet sandwich when I get Banh Mi, but when I looked at the pictures of their pork viet sandwich, it did NOT look like a viet sandwich.\n\nThe BBQ Beef Sandwich was pretty good for $3.25, but what I was expecting was a real vietnamese sandwich. The bread that was used was more of an italian bread texture than a french baguette, which is supposed to be used for Banh Mi. The flavor was alright as well. \n\nIf you're hungry, poor, and not looking for a viet sandwich, then you can come try their viet sandwiches. But if what you want is an actual viet sandwich, that is filled with delicious flavor, and authentic Banh Mi goodness, don't go here!!","453":"This theater becomes terribly overcrowded during weekend evenings. You'll find yourself surrounded by large groups of annoying teenagers. The ticket booth staff is often unpleasant, although I can't blame them for being so. Given the trauma that you may experience, the prices are way too high. Luckily, a full bar is available if you need it. One of the redeeming qualities is the credit card kiosks that allow you to avoid standing in long lines. You can usually find me here on Sunday mornings before noon when the price is just $5 and there aren't a lot of people.","454":"I am being a bit generous to give it 3 stars, as the place is no where near what it used to be.  I used to live around here when the Japanese stalls were operated by several Japanese young men with true Japanese Authentic flavors & the joints blew up. I used to come here every weekend,  the best Eel on rice (Another stall, long gone) and Japanese Raman I ever had were both in this place, the once famous  Japanese underground stalls at porter square. It was long time ago, before Lesley college took over. \n\nThey must have sold the joints as fast forward to 2018, there are no longer Japanese behind the counter cooking & servicing. The same applies to other stalls & and several Japanese Restaurants, I looked around a bit & they are all fake, it broke my spirit. \n\nStarting with the positive. The pork bun appetizer is very yummy,  I was very impressed, look at em pork in my picture, they are deeply flavorful and slightly sweet tasting. However, my main meal house Raman came in very disappointing, not that it tastes bad, but it has certainly lost it's authentic Japanese flavor.  The soup tastes more like corn chowder than Japanese Raman soup,  it just shows that one can copy the format making it look appealing, but it's a whole other story to replicate the true essence  of authentic Japanese Raman flavors.  I am actually sorry to see those 5 star reviews, poor general public has no idea what Japanese Raman was suppose to taste like.   \n\nI am also sad that my years of fond memory of authentic Japanese Raman at porter square was wiped from my brain in merely 30 min.  I should not have come back here, something is much better to be left as memories :(.","455":"I've been very curious to try this place out and finally made it over today (a Sunday around 10 am). As other reviewers have said, the parking situation isn't great, but there is additional parking behind the building and on the side street. When I got inside, the line was super long but moved pretty quickly. There was also a lot of open seating inside, though the outside patio was pretty full. I don't usually go for super sweet coffee so I got a half wintermoon. I thought the level of sweetness was perfect, but I found the drink to be really rich--I was only able to drink half before my stomach started hurting. I was curious about their nondairy options but didn't see them listed on the menu, and didn't want to hold up the long line asking the barista a million questions. Next time though, I think I'm going to have to be that person in order to keep my stomach happy with me.","456":"DO NOT ASK FOR FOOD!\nI went there last week and I ate a chicken sandwich, next day I was vomiting during the whole day, and I have had diarrhea since then, a total of 5 days... I hate being ill, thanks Seven's Ale House thanks!!! you made my week!","457":"Incompetent service department. Nothing but a headache. How do you not understand how HONDA CARE works?\n\nI leased my Honda in Indiana in 2013 and moved to Atlanta in 2014. My Indiana dealer told me my new Honda dealer here could lookup my Honda Care package through the Honda website - no problem. I told Curry Honda this three different times. They scheduled me for an 8:30am appt today at my request and said they would have to call when I arrived to verify my maintenance package. I arrive at 8:30am today, advise them for the third time now that I have the Honda Care package. \nThey say they can't find me and call my Indiana dealer to then ask incompetent questions so they get incorrect answers. I am then told they can't call Zuric to verify my plan until Monday. I'm like who's Zuric? I end up being apologized to and sent out the door. Ummm, what just happened? \n\nI leave and call my Stephens Honda dealer in Bloomington, Indiana and get the same guy the Curry svc advisor spoke to and he asked for my name. He said she never provided my name so he couldn't look me up but yes I have Honda Care Sentinel and there's no reason they cannot look this up. I go back into Curry since I'm still in their parking lot. The Service Manager then tells my service advisor: \"oh, well we can look it up but it will just tell us there is a plan but not what it pays for. We'll have to call them when they open at 10am to verify this.\" (An hour and a half after my appointment time.) I ask if it's this complicated why when I scheduled the appointment and said I have Honda Care did they not say I couldn't come in until 10am? They didn't know this answer. \n\nThey were supposed to call me 45 minutes ago to tell me what they found out from Honda Care Sentinel and give me a new appt time. If they ever call I will then tell them...\n\nI went to Ed Voyles Honda (15 minutes away) and they took care of me immediately and showed me my Honda Care plan on their computer. The Ed Voyles svc advisor said Curry should know what Honda Care pays for considering it's HONDA CARE. They only need to verify my plan is active which took him less than one minute. I was glad to see someone else was just as confused as me and competent enough to do his job well. \n\nTo jump back a bit...I went to Curry in June for the first time and the service advisor was confused then too about Honda Care and blew it off saying he's going to just give me my first oil change free as a thank you for visiting this Honda. This was the first time I told them I had this plan fyi.\n\nCurry's slogan is \"Come home to Curry.\" My advice is make your Honda home somewhere better than Curry Honda of Atlanta.","458":"I have had all 5 of my family cars serviced by Jeremy & his crew in 2015. Nothing short of excellent. New tires, new brakes, small repairs & oil changes have been priced competitively and completed in a timely fashion. Jeremy has been up front about everything. Going back for new Michelin tires soon!","459":"Okay, so I have never watched the show.  \n\nBut, I did \"grow up\" listening to NKOTB and Marky Mark.  Now I drool over the  grown up version, Mark, on the big screen.\n\nSo when my daughter had this spot on her Boston Bucket List... Well why not?\n\nWe drove out of the way just to have lunch here.  I suspect many people do.\nThe kids were hoping for a glimpse of some Wahlburgers. A glimpse of Paul, leaving was good enough.\n\nTotally friendly staff.  The burgers are good.  \n\nI ordered the OFD, the onion rings a chocolate strawberry malt and an assortment of cupcakes for our table to share.  We were a group of four, so we each got a taste of two regular sized cupcakes. My daughter and I shared the teeny, tiny, bite sized, whoopie pie mini cupcake.\n\nEach of the others ordered a different burger, side, and beverage.  It was pricey.  The four of us racked up a $70.00 bill.  \n\nBut we did get to put pins the USA and World maps.  If you see the pin in Ethiopia, that's my son in law!  \n\nTourist trap?  Probably. \nTasty? Yes.  \nWorth the big bucks? I say no.\nFun, yummy, one time, maybe we'll see a celebrity experience!","460":"I NEVER expected to get full 100% of the value nor the appraisal.  I'm not an idiot.  I understand the necessity of making a profit in a business. It's a question of ethics, integrity, and honesty.  I know you knew they were aquamarines because when I went to pick up my jewelry, the ring was in the aquamarine ring section!  OOPS","461":"Frankly - the servers are snobs. \nThe donuts are just okay and really - nothing special about the experience.\nI guess they aren't VooDoo and they know it. \n\nI understand the owner is popping these in near all of his Little Big Burger restaurants.","462":"Over priced. Sub-par service. Weak margs. Cold queso. Enough said, there are way better Tex-Mex restaurants in town.","463":"Too pricey in my opinion for what you get.  The food tastes good though. Service is fine and at lunch it's packed so it's an energetic atmosphere. It's clearly a popular choice in Buckhead, just not for me. \n\n($7 for a tiny salad!!!)","464":"I found a tick in my pho... The pho was alright though. I don't think I will be coming back here again as it seems and little dirty. People were nice, hence the extra star.","465":"The noodle dishes are especially good! This is as close to authentic as I've tasted outside Thailand!  Well done! Service isn't that great, and they didn't seem to speak Thai, but whatever I went there to eat.","466":"Me and my boyfriend went here for our one year anniversary. We had a reservation and were seated immediately in the bar area with a conjoining table which I usually don't mind, except it was ridiculously close to one another, to a point where we could over hear every word said. \n\nWe then waited for 15 minutes before some finally came over to take our drink orders. I ordered lemonade and what came out...wasn't. It was a sugary mess that tasted like someone had made some koolaid and put way to much sugar in it. They said it was a organic fruit lemonade but it was absolutely gross. \n\nWe then waited another 15 minutes before she came back and took our order. Me and my boyfriend are huge fans of artichoke hearts, so we ordered that as the appetizer. The batter was good but the preservative taste was repugnant . They were obviously canned and absolutely disgusting.  \n\nFor the main course I got the Turkey Muffaletta while my boyfriend got the horseshoe. Aside from being extremely under seasoned, my boyfriend actually got a bone in his sandwich that nearly chipped his tooth! \n\nThe only saving grace of this restaurant was the fact that the waitress recommended a decent wine. Will not be returning.","467":"After20 minutes waiting for our drink we got it credited. A Thursday afternoon at 330 shouldn't be a problem. We weren't the only ones. The guy in front of us was 30 minutes. I've been to a ton of Starbucks. They were in NO hurry. Not to mention only one person making drinks while others stood around. Good thing it wasn't my first Starbucks experience because I would never go to another after that.","468":"mmmmm... the burgers here were massive and delicious. Only downfall was the price.. it was slightly expensive for what you get. Fries were good as well, and everything seemed fresh. I will definitely be going back here. Food was also served really quick so I think this would be a great lunch spot!","469":"Headline reads: Breakfast cocktails! Use the rest to soak up the alcohol.\n\nIf I was in Fayetteville, NC and stumbled upon this place I would probably crap my pants. Buuuut, as it is, I live almost next door. Let's review my list:\nEverything is localish: Check\nService is okay, way better on weekdays: Check\nCocktails are delicious: Uber Check!\nFood is good: Well, its all cooked and has good combos, but I could make a veggie scramble with onions and other awesome ingredients in it. That doesn't qualify as well done.\n\nIts not a bad breakfast, but you might wish you had just bought groceries last night and made your own killer breakfast.","470":"I'm way behind on leaving a review for these guys, but I loved Eliot and his team so much the first time they moved me last year that when the time came for me and my girlfriend to move in together (from two opposite points of town into north Austin) I called Eliot first and again he and his guy that he brought really got the job done, and for a super fair price. \n\nIf you're looking for an honest guy that won't give you the run around on hidden fees, and a team that is fast and careful with your household items, you've come to the right place.","471":"Expectations:  I've learned not to expect corporate standards or owners to devote quality effort developing many businesses in this neighborhood since the last recession dashed expectation of burgeoning affluence.    Generally I don't expect gourmet cuisine of a 24\/7 diner, but hope (cautiously) for prompt quality service.\nComing in from a grueling crawl in snarled freeway traffic, I wanted some red meat to replenish blood cells diminished by too-long exhaust gas exposure.  I was uniquely not in any hurry, and glad I was near an all-night location, since most restaurants were close to closing.\n.\nI was greeted by a waitress apparently working on some bookkeeping at the terminal and told I could seat myself or wait for her to take me to a booth.  Not wanting to sit on a stool at the counter, I waited.  After several minutes, she seemed to defensively anticipate some criticism, so I joked that i wasn't in a rush for the bathroom to ease the tension.  (She didn't seem to have an \"indoor voice\".)  After some more time, I pointed out I could easily find an empty booth myself, and she was unexpectedly okay with that.  I picked a booth where, had the shrubbery been properly kept short, I could see my vehicle, and counted myself lucky I found the front door from the parking area (no sign directing).\nSome minutes later, a personable waiter came by with a meal menu.  I ordered a beverage and perused my options for a few more minutes, then ordered steak and eggs; when asked how I wanted it cooked, I said, \"tender and juicy\", which got a smile.\nI'd found no nibbles on the menu, so I nursed my beverage and sampled the wifi; the wait for my meal did seem rather long, especially for a diner. Eventually my meal did arrive as ordered.  The meat was indeed tender and juicy.  The rest was mildly warm, on a room-temperature plate.  The margarine never did melt on the toast or hash browns.\nI believe I recall the waiter later checking on me exactly once; when I was finished, I could see others checking out, and waited for the queue to clear.\nSince the place had more empty booths than occupied, I'd say it was not hectic, but may have been all a minimal staff could easily handle.  I somehow got an impression it was run by a family still learning to adjust to adult and\/or local-cultural expectations, but moving deliberately, making progress.  No alacrity, but a steady momentum.  And everything I saw was clean.","472":"Oil change for 20 bucks w\/ tax in 7 minutes. \n\nThat is the American Dream.","473":"Doesn't stand up to the quality of the NY location. Chicken was dry. It was even dark meat! Not prepared to order. Rice was dry and orange and flavorless. Expectations shattered.","474":"Had i written this review a week ago I would of given it 2 stars... at best....A week later it is a 5 star facility.  My MIL was in an accident, had surgery and needed a rehab. I am familiar with avery manor, briarwood and the many others in the surrounding area. She arrived on a Sunday, That was part of the problem... weekend nurses and staff. I did not find the aids very friendly and I was  concerned that the handling of her was a little rough.\nHowever, I spent the entire day there Monday and I met her Dr. PT, OT, Social worker and the other various support team.  I found them all to be kind, knowledgable and caring.  The nurses and aides (in particular Charles) are wonderful. Her social worker (gina) is always accessible to family.  Since we are there every day for most of the day we have been happy with the care she is given. the place is incredibly clean,lots of social activities and many seating areas that  family members can enjoy.\nHighly Recommended!!!!!","475":"Terrible service, went for a lunch buffet, food was cold and bland. It comes with fresh naan but shows up mostly in the end when we were about done, waiter couldn't care. Never going back!","476":"Came across Cooper's Hawk while in Orlando. Great atmosphere, food, wine and service. The wine tasting is really neat. I definitely recommend this place on the east side of Orlando.","477":"Food was by and large good but couldn't make up for the awful service.","478":"Wings are too expensive ($14.50 for 10).  The wings are too big and meaty, like a mini drumstick, ruining the texture.  Sauce flavors are okay but overall not worth the cost.","479":"Disappointed in the quality of the food here, not much care put into it at all. Small dry donair with very little ingredients.","480":"The owner was so friendly, and the curry was pretty yummy.\n\nSadly, a dead bug found in the sauce ruined the experience quite a bit.","481":"Flemmings.... oh Flemmings.  Value aside, the flem is a great steak house, especially for the wine lover, but if you take into accont the tired decor, shakey waitstaff, and uninteresting pre and post theater crowd, there's not much left other than a pretty expensive steak in your tummy.  Not a bad thing, just nothing to set it apart from a competitive niche in our fine city.\n\nWhat bothered me the most about Flemmings, was the pretentious waiter asking my dining partner what temperature or color she'd like her steak cooked.  Not everyone know's what \"blue\" means (I of course do) but it just isnt' smart to bite (or belittle) the hand that [tips] you.  If you can't get a reservation at 23, Capital, Abe's-  then dine at Flemmings if you must, but for my dollar-  head down the street to the Grill.","482":"The food was delicious and the serving size was good, but the price was a little steep in my opinion. I payed $12 for a gyro sandwich... That's it, no sides, just a sandwich and it was $12.\n\nI was here Friday evening around 7:00pm and it was practically empty. In fact, I opened the door and almost turned around because I thought they were closed. Inside the large restaurant there was only one couple and outside on the patio were another two couples. Nobody bar-tending at the bar and I only saw two staff members the whole time was there.\n\nGood food, steep price, lacked the atmosphere that I would prefer in a restaurant.","483":"I keep trying to write this review but the librarian keeps telling me to be quiet. \n \n   This library is a great place to go for free music they have a good collection of CDs. \n Got get CDs while you can after 2012 all music except for special and collector editions will be digital no more CDs.","484":"5 stars for the whiskey selection, 2 stars for the food, averaging out to 3.5 stars.\n\nMy friend and I shared the brisket plate with collard greens and garlic mashers, and the pulled pork sandwich. Southland's pit boss needs to step up if they want the goodness of the BBQ to match the prices they charge. Not much smoke flavor, almost zero bark on the brisket. The brisket plate came with a little smear of sauce on the plate; BBQ shouldn't depend on the sauce to give it flavor, but they should still provide a container of the stuff. Without the sauce, the brisket tasted a lot like - baked beef.\n\nI'd love to try their ribs and chicken, but for what they charge, I need to know they'll be good, but I'm not persuaded by what I've had so far.\n\nStill, everything seemed to be made with quality ingredients, and was well-prepared; we just wished it had been more like real BBQ. The high point of the meal was the collard greens and garlic mashers.\n\nService was efficient. I do plan to come back and sample some of their bourbons, though - Pappy van Winkle? I'm there!","485":"I'm not a beer person so I guess the Alibi Room was probably not the best choice for me. Having said that I've been trying to learn more about  beer (types, how it's made etc etc) so I figured what the hey, might as well start with a popular place. Their beer selection is quite impressive, especially the imported ones. I had the chocolate beer hoping for a sweeter brew and it was really tasty. My friends and I had dinner and the food was delicious and satisfied the palette. The only thing I did not like was the noise: it was so noisy I had to yell to talk across the table. I guess when you mix lots of people and beer all in close proximity the noise level just automatically increases. I'm a quiet person so that was a difficult meal to connect with friends. \n\nSo if you're just hanging out and looking for a great watering hole, then this is it. But if you're looking to catch up with friends and need an intimate space to chat I suggest you look else where. The main seating area is cafeteria style benches and everyone gets super cosy together. \n\nOh, and the ladies bathroom was pretty cool.","486":"I visited this dealer on June 1st 2013 in hopes of purchasing a 2012 Nissan Juke. My father had called the day before to ask what the best price was on the vehicle was, he was told $20,000. Hearing that I told him I'd love to go check out the vehicle. \n\nI liked the car and enjoyed the test drive and then asked the sales person I was dealing with to what the payments would be. He came out with a figure of $23,000 before taxes, after telling my father on the phone it would be $20,000. When I questioned him he responded, \"I don't recall every saying that,\" in a childish, bratty voice. \n\nI proceeded to tell him that I could buy a 2014 Mazda CX-5 for $23,000 and it would be ridiculous to buy his used Nissan with 40,000 miles on it. He proceeds, \"Oh CX-5's are nice. I used to sell them. Did you hear about the recalls?\" \n\nApparently he doesn't know what an Iphone is....2 minutes later I was walking out, after being treated like I'm stupid and a liar I wanted nothing to do with the dirt bags at Beaverton Nissan. I went over to Ron Tonkin Mazda the same day and ordered a brand new Mazda CX-5 for the same exact price as the used Nissan Juke...I love my Mazda. \n\nIf you're considering buying a vehicle from here, treat the salesmen like crap and as if they are stupid, apparently kindness doesn't work.","487":"This park is beautiful and a toddlers dream! You can watch boats, trains, planes, duck boats and not to mention the playground is awesome. A perfect spot for a picnic or a jog with great views of the city.","488":"We didn't know what to expect when we stopped in for a slice after my daughters dance class that's in the same plaza. WOW !! Ended up having the eggplant appetizer, a Stella pizza and a slice of Concord grape\/chocolate cake that I've been dreaming about ever since. Staff is friendly and outgoing and all the food was perfectly authentic. \nLooking forward to returning.","489":"What a fantastic meal! We had stellar service from Mario and Miro. The house made pasta, bread, burrata and gelato were all absolutely delicious. The restaurant itself is lovely, we were seated in a large, comfortable booth near a roaring fire-perfect on a cold night. Our waiter easily answered all of our questions about specific menu items, arranged for us to have a side item not always available, and exchanged an appetizer with a smile when it was not what my companion expected. All in all, a really great meal - I will be back!","490":"I had lunch here with a friend and my two-year-old son on a weekday when the weather was still warm. We sat outside on their terrace. I was looking forward to being able to just sit down rather than fight my way through the market. I wish I hadn't bothered.\n\nThe food was overpriced, and nothing we received was good - not only that, we waited nearly 40 minutes for it. My deep-fried fish was dark and claggy with tasteless batter. My companion had asked the waitress what her sandwich came with, and didn't get much of an answer, so she ordered a side salad. Her sandwich came with a decent serving of coleslaw. The expensive side salad was limp greens, barely dressed. My son's peanut butter and jam sandwich cost a shocking $7 and was tiny, as well as hard on the edges, meaning it had been cut much earlier and left to sit. \n\nWhen the bill came, I discovered that my son's juice was charged at full adult price despite coming in a small child's glass and the waitress double-checking we wanted a child's juice. A completely ridiculous, over-priced experience, I will never go back.","491":"Great outdoor patio, good old fashioned S. 1st 'keeping it weird' vibe, good happy hour prices, not so good happy hour food. \n\nWe ordered: Spinach quesadillas & chips\/queso\/salsa\/guacamole plate as well as a sweet tea. Quesadillas were good. Queso was runny. Guacamole lacked taste. The sweet tea was meh. As there are so many restaurants in Austin with excellent queso\/guac\/sweet tea, if you're serving these items, they've got to be pretty damn good. Competition is fierce! \n\nI'd maybe come back for the ambiance and\/or the live music, but not for the food. \n\nLots of kids and dogs. I'm not a fan of either (and wildly allergic to dogs), but they seemed to be contained to the outside. \n\nParking was also a challenge. Lot was full, so we had to park in the neighborhood behind Freddie's - maybe 5 minutes away. Wasn't a problem for us - walking it out after eating all of that queso was probably for the better -  however someone with kids or a disability might find this troublesome.","492":"I used to love this place. Just had the most tasteless meal ever.  You could not teal the chicken from the noodles in the low mien. The hot and sour soup was neither.  I don't expect the best meal ever from delivery shop but this sets a new low. \n\nLast dollar spent here!  Go elsewhere.","493":"This place is extremely polarizing and because of it, creates a somewhat bad taste in my mouth.\nOn one hand, their portions, flavor selection, and amazing cookie sandwiches keep us coming back.\nOn the other hand, the staff is extremely inconsistent.  On any given day, you can purchase 2 ice cream sandwiches and be charged $9.  Go another day in the week and all of a sudden you're paying $20!!!  I've never had the same price\/experience twice at this place and I've been coming here for about 7 years now.\n\nIt honestly leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  If your staff can't prepare food and charge the correct prices for each item, then the staff needs to be properly trained or the menu needs to be sized down.  It's not rocket science and since this place was rebuilt after being demolished, they should have ample technology to help the workers perform their jobs properly, or at least you'd hope so.  I'll come back again, but I'm on the fence about returning depending on how that experience goes.","494":"My friend wanted to meet here to catch up.  I arrive a bit early on a Thursday morning and the place was packed with people all sitting on their lap tops.  I ended up sitting outside as I knew we would be talking.  It was like a library in the coffee shop.  There wasn't even any music on.  After a while we decided to go sit at the bar in the back by the bathrooms as it was a bit cold outside.  The place got a tad louder but we were still whispering.  I got tea and it was fine for $3.  My friend got a cup of black coffee and it was $3 and then they wanted $2 for a refill.  It is basic black coffee in a normal size coffee mug.  $2 for a refill seems high.  We were there about two hours and mostly this seems to be a place for people to work.  I doubt I would be back.  I want to support local and small but the refill policy is out of touch.  Staff was too the point.  Not overly nice but not rude.  Plenty of parking.","495":"Red chowder and the lobster roll was very good however the service was something to be desired. But then again it is in an airport.","496":"The worst!  I ordered one of their specialty pizzas a few weeks ago to go and it was way undercooked.  A few days ago I was walking by and there was an employee changing a baby's diaper in the window of their backroom.  Health department?   Call me crazy but I was hungry and live close so I thought I'd give them another shot.  I called and the guy who answers the phone asks me to wait a minute.  As I am waiting for way too long, he doesn't put me hold, he just puts the phone down.  I then get to hear how he and another guy are discussing what to do with all the messed up orders.  I hung up.  My prediction.  They won't be in this high rent location for long.","497":"Who let the old folks out? Anytime I have been to this place on a Fri or Sat night it is dominated by the 40+ crowd. Seriously, this place does some great things. During the NFL season they really kick it into high gear. They also occasionally have the radio station 98.5 the sports hub broadcasting live. The food isn't bad but you won't rave about it either. I just wish they could find a way to attract a slightly younger crowd.","498":"To be honest, I'm more of a Nike nerd than an Adidas addict. But who could resist an additional 40% off the lowest ticketed price? Not me! Regular price items get a 25% discount. Doorcrashing Vancouver Whitecaps (Go Caps Go!) jerseys for $25 and team tees as low as $9.95. Was also quite impressed with their Originals selection, though most of them were a bit too logo-laden. Nevertheless, think I'm becoming a mild Adidict...","499":"Date Visited: Wednesday 1\/16\/13 (Lunch)\n\nI pass by Bamboo Thai every single day, to and from work and it's quite new.  I noticed it a few days ago, so thought I would contact them (email) and ask about vegetarian and vegan dishes.  Because a response (though vague) came back within hours (good 1st impression), I thought I would try them out.  First, let me say that the lunch menu, posted on their website as of 1\/16\/13), was found to be inaccurate upon paying.  Not the best 2nd impression.\n\nThe restaurant is located on Oak, right by the Apple Music store (between Skidmore Fountain and Oak St. MAX stops).  It looks very fancy inside.  The door closest to the music store did not open and had no sign that said go to the other door, but I digress.  My lunch was retrieved quickly from a small bundle of take out orders, so I actually made good time in getting there from work AND returning....always a plus.  \n\nI ordered a medium strength (spice) Pad Thai with vegetables and tofu.  I didn't specify that I was vegetarian, on the phone, but hoped my request for the vegetarian tofu version was enough.  For $8 (not $7 like the menu on-line says), I thought it was okay.  It filled the 3 compartment plastic container pretty well.  The taste didn't blow me away and I'm not entirely sure it was vegetarian without me having to mention removing anything non-vegetarian from the sauce.  I'm told 65% of the menu can be made vegan, so Spazz and me may drop by in the future and just make sure our meals are safe to eat.","500":"We had an ok experience with hertz but I will not rent from them again next time we go to Florida. First off, we were disappointed to learn when we picked up the car that despite being married, it would cost extra for me to be able to drive the car when I put my husbands name on our trip first. The lovely airport employee who helped us carry our luggage told us other companies do not charge for that.\n\nThen even though I bought rental insurance when I bought our trip thru orbitz they tried to get us to buy their insurance saying the one I bought with our package was a 3rd party and we would have trouble collecting if anything happened. \n\nLastly, when we dropped off the car, we did a last look thru and missed seeing a $50 long umbrella we had just bought the day before in the car, the garage was poorly lit where we were and it was black in a dark gray interior of the car so we failed to see it. Didnt realize it until we were in the security line and with all our luggage and a 2 year old were worried about going back and then missing our flight. I called as soon as we got home that afternoon and of course were told that nothing was in the car. It was there because I had moved it trying to get the stroller out of the car.\n\nSo all in all I am not crazy about our experience with them and will try a different rental company next time we go on vacation.","501":"Moved in across the street! My boyfriend and I we're so excited to have a Mexican restaurant so close! It took us about a month, but finally one Thursday afternoon (3-10-16) we went to lunch all 5 of us for the first time. We ordered the sampler for starters and I did enjoy most of the options on this plate. For an entree I ordered the Pollo Asado, most of the rest of the table got a variation of a quesadilla. My dish was very bland. And the rice tasted almost store bought. The chicken was very plain. I don't know if maybe it was an off day. Or maybe I didn't pick the right first meal but I found myself underwhelmed by the overall experience. \n\nPro: It is pretty decorated inside and I can see how it could make for a fun dinner night. \n\nI will definitely give them another shot however, I refuse to give up on a place so close! And with all the awesome reviews I hear of, even from clients at my work, it has to be good right?","502":"Took the family to Disney a few weeks ago and we decided to stay in the Pop Century Resort for a few days.  Our most recent previous experience with this type of budget resort was the All-Star Sports resort, and Pop Century by far is the better of the two resorts to stay at. Pop Century was built around 2000 or 2001, and is wonderfully themed with each building representing a different decade.  We stayed in the 80's building which ended up being very convenient for us.  There are multiple pools on the property, and there are also a couple coin-op laundromats on the premises for people staying longer than just a few days.  The staff for the most part (except for the young woman who checked us in) were extremely helpful and friendly.  \n\nThe girl who checked us in was very unenthusiastic about helping us check in with our reservation when we asked for a small request (a refrigerator), and kept us waiting for two hours past check in before getting a room. I had to ask for a manager to finally get us situated in a room. However, compared to all the wonderful experiences we have received at Disney in the past, I figured we would have some sort of bad experience once in awhile, even Disney can't be perfect.\n\nOnce we were settled in with a room, we walked the whole property to take in all the cool details to this resort.  The food court was clean and organized, and there was a good variety of cuisines available for different tastes and diets.  There is even an arcade and a playground area for the kids to play and run around in, which I honestly didn't expect to see!  Extra cool points to Disney for that small amenity.\n\nWe had a wonderful stay at this property, and I knew we would be back again when my two-year old girl looked up at me and said, \"Daddy, Mickey sure has a nice house.\"  Yes he does, sweetie, he sure does.","503":"Forget the beautiful animals, every show has a person with an impeccable narrating voice that puts Morgan Freeman to shame.  \n\nWorth every penny (rounded up while you're in Canada)","504":"First time at BonChon and its alright. It's a pretty small store for the chain concept and possibly great for those looking to experiment with Korean food if they haven't tried it before to get a taste but too afraid to go all in at a Korean restaurant. \n\nWe tried a variety of things and my favorite was the wings (half and half) and the takoyaki (octopus balls). We tried other things such as the pork buns and korean tacos. The pork buns pork belly was very thin and that was disappointing compared to the photo on the menu. Imagine the width and length of a pinky finger. Yup. Then, we chose bulgolgi for the Korean Taco which was easy to eat and okay. The Takoyaki was crispy on the outside but still soft and warm on inside. \n\nLastly, the wings. I thought the size was great. It's not too big or small for what I consider normal. I thought it was crispy and crunchy enough but not too hard. We got the half and half which is the spicy and soy. \n\nOverall, its a okay choice for a casual lunch or dinner. It isn't cheap either though but upscale casual food if you can say that.","505":"This is a good place for lunch. We ordered delivery and the food was hot when it arrived. The hot and sour soup is delicious as is the salt and pepper calamari. We also ordered Ma Po Tofu.... I'd pass on that (to be fair Ma Po Tofu is hit or miss anyway). All in all a good experience.","506":"Ive been writing this review in my head for about a month now. And Im a bit stuck, because i like to give fair reviews and take everything into account and make sure im not too euphoric from a good meal or too angry from suspect service. \n\nIn that vein, I write this review. My first and only experience at 246 was just after Christmas, 2011. We arrived on time for our 8pm on time and were told that a table for our party of 8 wasnt available, so we patiently waited by the bar and got some drinks. About 25 minutes later we were seated at 3 2-tops placed together giving us not quite enough room for 8, though it was much better than standing and getting bumped into at the bar.\n\nThe server came over, gave us the specials, poured some water (that might have been someone else though) and took our drink orders. Some time later she came back to take our food orders, and about 10 minutes after that our drinks came. There was much rejoicing!\n\nNow the food is amazing, on the same level as Iberian Pig (which as you know is my favourite restaurant in Atlanta), but the service was really lacking on this night. Our server was doing the best she could as we saw another table giving her a hard time with every dish that was delivered. \n\nIll give them another shot, because the food is so good, and hopefully their service will match their food.","507":"I love Japanese foods whether is snacks, pastries, desserts, sushi, sashimi or ramen.  Vancouver has a lot of Japanese restaurants but not many of restaurants are authentic\/tradition Japanese cuisine.  I haven't find any good Japanese restaurant that can make me say \"Wow\" or compare with Japan's restaurants. \n\nMarutama Ramen is a small and franchise shop in Vancouver. They emphasis the ramen make in house and broth is chicken-based instead of pork-based.\n\nWe ordered tamago cha-shu ramen (sliced roast pork with egg ramen) and extra cha shu. The chicken broth has depth and rich flavour, but soft-boiled egg was a bit overlooked. Cha shu were too fatty and cold.\n\nMy hubby had comment that we paid over $40 for 2 ramen in Tokyo but we paid $30 in Vancouver not getting a good ramen.  That's sad!","508":"I stopped in to buy a baby gift for my niece.  I settled on a cute outfit that was organic cotton and made in America.    Awesome find and very glad to have that choice, prices are in line with quality.   Would have liked more made in America and organic choices.   Store clerk was nice, I like the focus on high quality and natural items and will definitely stop in again.","509":"It's tex-mex but has some beautiful interior, traditional mexican dishes on the menu.\n\nThe Curra's papas for example, are french fries topped with ground chorizo and mozzarella cheese. Sounds weird, but OMG delicious and heavy!\n\nThe carnitas were perfect. Tender, flavorful, and you can't stop eating it! The black beans are good, but the corn tortillas are thick and flavorless\n\nThe mole is incredibly complex, and almost as good as my favorite, famed Houston-chef Hugo Ortega's mole. I thought the charro beans were missing something in the flavor and the beans were even a tad undercooked. The wheat tortillas are better here than the corn tortillas.\n\nI look forward to coming back and sampling more of their traditional Mexican dishes, including their tamales. There's a lot of bad tex mex in this town, and I'm happy to have found a place that not only doesn't drown everything in cheese, but also highlights and exalts the flavors and spices of a culture that takes incredible pride in their cooking and food.","510":"Well I decided to give them a try since I only live 5 minutes away. Went there on a Thurday night and we decided to sit outside. It was a group of 4. Now the vibe is good seating comfortable and they have a few things to keep you busy like tvs, beanback toss, take a picture with nyc statue of Liberty. So we were attended quickly. After reviewing the menu whiched seemed like forever because none of us quite saw anything on the menu we liked. So it was a toss up. We order the wings and the artichoke dip and the meat lovers pizza. Wings never again and omg the pizza was horrible, the dip was good. Know none of us are picky eaters but YUCK won't be back. So it was just our opinions.","511":"Lost my package, tracking was no good. I have nothing to say except they cost me 800.00","512":"Note that Terminal A and Terminal B are NOT connected to each other via the same post-security area. The good thing is that the walk isn't too far at all (there's a long hallway). \n\nThe food options in Terminal A were limited; the most tasty option I could find there was Wendy's. \n\nIf you call an Uber for pick up, you need to go to their designated purple App area, which is a ~5 min walk from baggage claim (follow the signs).","513":"I haven't tried pizzahut since years. I orders chicken supreme and ultimate chicken lovers. Although I made a late order (11:30 pm) but the pizza was incredible. I suggest to give a try if you want good pizza!","514":"Definitely a Beautiful Garden! Do you mind walking long distances? If not, this is the perfect place to visit with your other half. I visited this place on my anniversary. Me and my wife both had the best experience walking through this amazing place. We enjoyed taking pictures every single spot of the garden. From flowers to old historic shelters or once upon a time used to be a home, or a blacksmith forges. This is a nice place to go and explore the beautiful life surrounded by nature and butterflies as well. Go there and explore the nature a lil bit more and get out of the stressful working life.","515":"Went here a while back for mani\/pedi.  I was thinking that the girl just phoned in my services because I was using a Groupon, but based on other reviewers, it sounds like what I received is status quo.\n\nShoddy work on my hands (she even left one of my nails uneven and didn't bother with my cuticles), and no scubbing or massaging on my feet or calves.  \n\nIf these nice folks are trying to make a go of having a business - they really need to put in a little effort.  Maybe they should go to a REAL pedicure place to see what the service should be.","516":"There were Cockroaches in our room!!! Stayed at this hotel for a summit cheer competition.  Cockroaches were running across my floor in the middle of the day. The employee at the front desk said that they couldn't put me in another room.  The maintenance man actually came up to the desk and told him that he had to find me another room.  I asked several times to speak to a manager.  I was told that she was not available and would call me back.  It took several hours to get a call back from her.  She finally said that they had a different room for me.  She reluctantly agreed to comp 2 days off my 5 night stay.  I had been sleeping in the cockroach infested room for 3 nights.  Terrible customer service!!","517":"This hotel was a pleasant surprise! My kids and I were stranded in Orlando for 2 nights when our flights home were cancelled due to weather. We chose this hotel because of its 24-hour airport shuttle and ended up being pleasantly surprised. The staff was so friendly and accommodating, going out of their way to make us comfortable. Room service food was surprisingly good and the pool\/hot tub area was very clean. Our suite was great - big, bright living room with plenty of room for the kids and all their toys, plus a great-sized bedroom and bath. The airport shuttle was so convenient - we needed it at 4:30am to make a 6am flight and they couldn't have been more helpful - so great. Wonderful experience!","518":"Love checking out new brewpubs in Cbus area. Brewdog is the weirdest one by far!  Merch room hits you in the face as you walk in, then a large waiting room...thats right, waiting room (large). Could not get past said waiting room since all seats at bar were taken. OK, I've been to bars when seats taken, I get in row 2 and stand around with a beer meeting people. Not at Bresog. Many open table seats but had to wait aprox 10 minutes (without a beer). Was then seated at a table where I couldn't even see the bar. Wasn't there to eat, just check out the beer, bar and vibe. 1 for 3. Not a real brewpub, more like a restaurant. Bad 1st impression.  Won't drive the 30 mins anytime soon. Beer was cold and tasty.","519":"Well first off we walked in and there was a girl holding the door and at the desk two people\nTalking. They were leaning on a counter with their backs to us. We stood there and finally the guy turned around and stared at us.... I said can we get a table? He said \" uh, yeah. How many of ya\" I said three. He looked back at the other girl he was talking with and the girl at the door said I'll help you. He seemed like we were bothering him. We should have walked out then. \n\nWe got seated and someone came to take our drink orders. Got two ice teas right away and the last drink took another 7-10 minutes. When it arrived we placed our order. After we ordered my daughter said what is this black thing in my drink?  It clearly looked like a bug we got someone over to our table and told\nThem. A minute later the manager came and told us it was mint. Mint is green and doesn't have wings. I don't believe it was mint. They replaced the drink 5 minutes later and although the waitress told my daughter it was sweet it was really tart like drinking the candy smarties. We asked for sprite instead. Again, five minutes or more to get the drink. The pizza took at least 30-40 minutes to arrive. It was okay. Nothing special. Wayyyyy too much sauce but I dared not complain because we were hungry. Honestly Pizza Hut is cheaper and better and I'm not a fan of fast food so that says a lot.","520":"Kind of over rated in my opinion. The only good thing I've had here are the pancake balls which in all honesty are not extremely unique in any way. All other brunch dishes I've tried have been soggy and felt heavy. Kind of a cool spot in terms of the set up and their patio, but there are a lot of places in Columbus I'd choose to come for brunch over this one","521":"Typical story, when they first opened they were great. Fast forward to the quality falling off followed by the cleanliness then the service. Don't bother.","522":"My low rating is strictly because this restaurant can't seem to stay consistent with their menu and it keeps getting worse.  First went the house sauce and now they have gotten rid of the thinly sliced beef and lamb?!  Apparently beef and lamb is going to be a \"seasonal\" meat now and they have replaced it with cubed over cooked steak.  Bad move Verts. You are taking all the things off the menu that made the restaurant good.","523":"Sidelines is a great sports bar!  I love their pizza, beer, and the staff is always awesome.  We've been quite a few times to watch football and have had a great experience every time.  Plus... any place I can always get a table, plus a pitcher of beer, wings, AND a pizza for $20?!  What's NOT to love!  This is definitely one of my favorite Mount Dora spots.","524":"I thought this was kind of average.  I might be spoiled because I have access to a lot of ice cream options.  Their ice cream is light and fluffy.  I think they whip more air into it similar to Dreyer's Slow Churned.  I tried several flavors.  The one that stood out was the blueberry balsamic.  The waffle cone was good.  I only stopped by because it was on the way to the airport.  I would not make a special trip there.","525":"The worst thing I ever ate, could be featured on food network for their show \"restaurant impossible\". Pizza was congealed, greasy, mealy...came over an hour later than promised, came with the wrong toppings- meat on a vegetarian pizza. Was not even remotely edible- so bad that it tasted better when it arrived cold than after we tried to save dinner by reheating it. It had NO taste. Needless to say, I am still hungry and will never be ordering from here again and neither should you.","526":"Great ambience during the Canada vs USA Olympics Hockey Semi-Final game! Their portions are very large too and very filling. I had the Chicken, Walnut, blue cheese salad and that was very tasty. \nI would def recommend this place as a great get together with friends for a sports event","527":"I was in desperate need of a hair cut. Of course all salons are closed on Monday and my regular place couldn't get me in until next week. I work in Allston, so I figured why not. The reviews of this place weren't so bad. I went and my appt was with Jennifer. First of all my appt was at 6pm and I wasn't seen until 6:30. I had a very hard time communicating with Jennifer because she doesn't speak english very well. We started with the wash - I think she was trying to massage but she was so rough my eyes were tearing up and she kept putting the water right into my ear. \n\nWe moved on to the cutting part. At this point, I was scared. Before she started cutting I thought she had a good idea of what I was looking for. Things were going good. Then a walk-in came in and the owner (I think) asked her if she could take a walk in - a little disgruntled she replied yes. But then I noticed she really started hurrying on my hair. \n\nIn the end, it came out alright. I cut about 4 inches off my hair so it was a bit drastic. Many people have told me it looks cute - only one person has said that a few pieces look to be cut incorrectly. \n\nWill I go back - no. Why? Because it was more for a cut and dry than the place I go on Newbury St. and not nearly as nice.","528":"Remarkably poor service. They will make you a burrito to go regardless of what you order unless you argue with them at each stage in the process. \n\nFood is decent, but probably only worth it if you don't particularly care what you eat. Better selection than Chipotle next door but slightly more expensive","529":"I was really eager to come out here and check this place out, but I was quite disappointed.\n\n-Service was not very attentive\n-Food: so the baked goods are definitely way too sweet. I would have preferred a 'buttercream' type frosting over an \"icing' on my cupcakes because it just gets way to sweet and its just a chunk of sugar. Its also a reflection of all of their desserts which, aren't all vegan and aren't all gluten free. Everything is just a bit of something, so its not exactly aligned with an actual vegan mission. The tempeh soup was way too salty, albeit flavorful. I did enjoy the avocado in the salad. If I wasn't pressed on time, I would have preferred to enjoy a cup of tea. But not sure if I would go back...","530":"I went inside to get a coffee and ended up waiting 15 minutes in line to place my order and then another 5 minutes after that for a COFFEE. ONCE I GOT IT, IT WASN'T HOT. I'm beyond pissed right now because we have a 6 hr drive and will now have to stop again to try to find another hot cup of coffee. This was the 2nd McDonalds we had gone to this morning because all the drive thru's were backed up at 10:30p","531":"brushetta salad& pasta good, service ok, but grilled chicken on pasta was very dry chewy, tasted microwaved & basically unedible - I told waiter & then he brought us the check charging extra for the bad dry chicken.  went to hostess & asked for mngr - was cracking up when a 18 yr old kid came out!  Really on a busy Fri nite this is the mngr they put in charge??  I tell kid story & he looks at me with blank stare.................Nuff said!","532":"Best donuts I have ever had. If u come to Portland you must go here. Skip voodoo. This place uses organic ingredients and the donuts are absolutely amazing.","533":"We went here with friends after work, we ordered some beers and nachos and 2 pizzas , we could hear some male's voice from the rear kitchen using very foul language. I get it ,its a bar but come on. Gets some class. They forgot our nachos and the pizza came out with a curly black hair on one of them.  The other pizza was covered in a layer of grease.  We WONT be back.","534":"\u5099\u8a3b\uff1a\u6b64\u98df\u8086\u6703\u5411\u9867\u5ba2\u6536\u53d6\u653f\u5e9c\u92b7\u552e\u7a05GST\n\n\u5217\u6cbb\u6587\u7684\"\u91d1\u9418\u5eca\"\u5176\u5be6\u7b97\u4e0d\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u8cfc\u7269\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u88e1\u7684\u79df\u6236\u5927\u90e8\u4efd\u662f\u7528\u4f5c\u5c0f\u578b\u5546\u696d\u8fa6\u516c\u5ba4\u548c\u5b78\u751f\u88dc\u7fd2\u793e\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u90e8\u4efd\u4eba\u66f4\u4e0d\u6703\u60f3\u5230\u6b64\u8655\u6709\u7f8e\u98df\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u5462\uff01\u7f8e\u98df\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8aaa\u4f4d\u65bc\u5546\u5834\u4e8c\u6a13\uff0c\u5730\u65b9\u4e0d\u7b97\u5927\uff0c\u5927\u6982\u53ea\u6709\u4e03\u516b\u9593\u98df\u8086\u5728\u9019\u88e1\u7d93\u71df\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2d\u6e2f\u53f0\u65e5\u98a8\u5473\u7f8e\u98df\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u514d\u8cbb\u67b1\u6905\u4f9b\u98df\u5ba2\u5011\u7528\u9910\uff01\u82e5\u6cca\u8eca\u5728\u4e0a\u5c64\u505c\u8eca\u5834\u7684\u8a71\uff0c\u6709\u5165\u53e3\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u9054\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8d70\u6a13\u68af\u6216\u4e58\u642d\u5347\u964d\u6a5f\u3002\u5176\u5be6\u9019\u88e1\u4e5f\u662f\u672c\u4eba\u5f88\u5c11\u6d89\u8db3\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u8a00\u6709\u8b02\u300c\u81e5\u864e\u85cf\u9f8d\u300d\u6b63\u597d\u5957\u7528\u5728\u672c\u6587\u6240\u4ecb\u7d39\u9019\u5bb6\u98df\u8086\uff0c\u5b83\u5c31\u662f\u4f4d\u65bc\u91d1\u9418\u5eca\u7f8e\u98df\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u300c\u559c\u60a6\u7ca5\u9eb5\u7f8e\u98df\u300d\n\n\u7531\u65bc\u5546\u5834\u4eba\u6d41\u8f03\u5c11\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u7f8e\u98df\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u98df\u8086\u90fd\u6703\u5404\u81ea\u5236\u5b9a\u958b\u8216\u6642\u9593\u548c\u4f11\u606f\u65e5\uff0c\u800c\u559c\u60a6\u6bcf\u5929\u7531\u65e9\u4e0a8\u6642\u5df2\u958b\u59cb\u71df\u696d\uff0c\u662f\u6574\u500b\u7f8e\u98df\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6700\u65e9\u958b\u9580\u7684\u98df\u5e97\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5e97\u5bb6\u7684\u6e2f\u5f0f\u6392\u6a94\u8178\u7c89\u7ca5\u54c1\u548c\u6cb9\u5668\u505a\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u5230\u4f4d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9867\u5ba2\u99f1\u9a5b\u4e0d\u7d55\uff0c\u751f\u610f\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u3002\u53ef\u60dc\u5e97\u5bb6\u4eba\u624b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8001\u95c6\u592b\u5a66\u548c\u4e00\u4f4d\u963f\u5b38\u53ea\u6709\u4e09\u500b\u4eba\u8ca0\u8cac\uff0c\u65e2\u8981\u5fd9\u65bc\u770b\u7dca\u6cb9\u944a\u88e1\u4e0d\u505c\u7ffb\u6efe\u7684\u73fe\u70b8\u6cb9\u689d\uff0c\u53c8\u8981\u4e0d\u505c\u505a\u624b\u62c9\u8178\u7c89\uff0c\u5c0d\u5ba2\u4eba\u7684\u79ae\u8c8c\u7d55\u5c0d\u6b20\u5949\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9ed1\u9762\u5c31\u8981\u76e1\u5feb\u843d\u55ae\u548c\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff0c\u5ee2\u8a71\u5c11\u8b1b\u5566\uff01\u7531\u65bc\u6211\u4e0d\u80fd\u63a5\u53d7\u5e97\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u8ce3\u5851\u81a0\u7897\u4f86\u76db\u8f09\u6efe\u71b1\u8fa3\u7684\u7ca5\u54c1\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u53ea\u9ede\u4e86\u9019\u88e1\u6700\u99b3\u540d\u7684\u6cb9\u689d\u548c\u8178\u7c89","535":"Came across this place randomly, trying to find a dry haven to keep us away from pouring Oregon rain. Glad we did! This place was neat in the sense that they offered cocktails, coffee and other hot drink choices, as well as pies! I was having a mimosa, while I had a friend having a pie, and another having a coffee! It was just funny how we could all be enjoying such different things at the same time. \n\nLiked the atmosphere of the place, the staff was fun and friendly, and the interior had a lot of interesting ostrich art to look at.. haha!","536":"If you've ever been the parent of a $5 bill you know that its not easy. You want your little bill to succeed in life but the world is a harsh place. $5 bills don't usually make it far in life. Flaming Bird is a place that you can enroll your bill and have it become the best in can be. Help your child spread its wings","537":"Not bad place so far, certainly dated (popcorn ceiling, green carpet), but plenty of facilities from the small store in the resort, to the good location in Orlando.\n\nI might try it one more time but wouldnt recommend it unless you had a really big group and didnt mind a slight time machine experience.","538":"Such a scam. Everyone I know who has graduated from this place doesn't even use their degree. I'm sure I won't either. Creative and school just don't, and never will, go together! SAVE YOUR MONEY! Six months into our degree program is when they begin to tell you your likely hood of success is slim to none, unless you are content with being an unpaid intern or a gofer. Neither of those are going to put a dent in the debt you owe!","539":"We had a very good meal here last night. It was our first time at Woods Hill Table for food.\n\nWe ordered several appetizers for our meal, as they were more appealing than the entrees.\n\nWe had the broccoli, the gnocchi, and the beet salad. I think we liked all three for different reasons, and they complemented each other well. The quality and freshness was very high. Well worth the extra spend.\n\nFor beer we had Night Shift Santilli. My wife wanted wine but they didn't have NZ sauv blanc. Just a few from California. The liquor drinks are made with craft brands. You won't find Grey Goose or Bulleit here. Unique.\n\nThis restaurant is busy on Fridays and Saturdays. We were informed that a reservation is required if a table is desired. Otherwise you put your name on the list for seats at the bar.\n\nThey had a cancellation so we got a nice table by the window. \n\nI recommend this restaurant highly. A very different experience than many of the restaurants in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we got a table quite quickly, which is a feat as you need a reservation for Friday and Saturday nights.","540":"I'm really concerned about an experience my niece had here called \"Star Search.\" As part of a training exercise for new employees, they go into the mall and select random people to receive a free session under the guise of a \"model search.\" My niece, who is 14, was chosen and taken back to the studio to have her pictures taken. They never asked her age, no adult was present, they never gave her any information about the real reason behind the shoot (she now thinks she's on track to be a professional model instead of being used as a training guinea pig), and she never had to sign any releases giving Picture People the right to use her images, for training purposes or otherwise. She left the studio without the names of any photographers, no business card, nothing. After she told me this, I was horrified and we immediately had a conversation about safety and going places alone with strangers, but I was also shocked at Picture People's business practices. How is it OK to use minors in such a way? Have new photographers gone through a background check? I can see this being an easy way for sexual predators to get their hands on young children. I eventually tracked down which studio she'd gone to and called them to try and find out what had happened, which was when they told me about \"Star Search.\" I tried to explain it to them from my side and they agreed that it did sound suspect when I explained it like that, but obviously their intentions were good and that \"no one had ever had a problem with it before.\" I find that EXTREMELY hard to believe. I asked them what they were doing with the photos they took of her, and they said that they would only live on their server for training purposes, not for distribution. I recommended they reevaluate their business practices--this is as disaster waiting to happen. I'm giving them two stars for at least talking to me and putting their GM on the phone, and I'm thankful nothing happened to my niece, but I think this is a completely unprofessional and frightening way to operate. I'm calling their headquarters on Monday to discuss Star Search practices.","541":"I had the lamb gyro, bf had chicken gyro, and we shared Greek coffee and Greek beignets. Everything was amazing!!! I will partake in the expansive wine\/beer selection next time. The service was very friendly and the ambiance was cozy and comfortable. They also have board games and stuff around. Will return soon.","542":"Cool place, busy on a Friday evening.\n\nWas looking to try the hand pulled noodle soup\/ramen but OMG the chefs special looked amazing. People at table next to us had this massive pile of food - different meats, noodles and rice - so much that they at their dinner and took 2 take home boxes away - definitely next time for me\n\nOrdered the soup dumplings - very nice\n\nHad the noodle soup with shrimp and wife had same with chicken. Noodles were great - al dente - and about 6 feet long or so it seemed . Shrimp were cooked well not overdone. Some bok choy and broth was nice.\n\nA lot of noodles to eat - ended up leaving some. These have been compared to ramen or pho - it's a different experience, not as aromatic or herby as pho not as Unami as ramen - and not anywhere near as many fixins - but nice\n\nWill def head back again - probably for the chef special above\n\nCool to see the dude making the hand pulled noodles - happy fella and eager to show off his skills","543":"Went for lunch today-  only a few people in there - but its off the beaten path of lunch traffic so not too surprising. \n\nThe service was slow, and to the food was Meh. \n\nI got the L9 lunch special: vegetable low mein, chicken and broccoli, and spareribs. Everything was EXTREMELY salty, and nothing was good. the meat tasted really odd. The chicken was slimy and the ribs were hard. \n\nBoyfriend got the S11: pork fried rice- not bad\/ not good. sweet and sour chicken (just breaded chicken which sauce that tasted like it was from a jar) and crab rangoon. \n\nWill not be heading back there.","544":"I don't understand the hype for this place. I ordered a latte, and it was lukewarm at best. I couldn't taste the espresso- it tasted like overpriced lukewarm milk. I ended up tossing it and going somewhere else :(","545":"My entire experience here was good, but Dr. Adriel Lopez really made it a five-star experience. I'm new to the eye glasses game, having only had one exam before and owned one pair of glasses prior, but I can confidently say that Dr. Lopez was about 50x more thorough and enjoyable to be examined by than the doctor I visited with on my previous visit at another chain. He made the exam fun, as did his pre-testing assistant, but also took the time to explain the more serious aspects of my eyes in a way no one had taken the time to do before. I left feeling like I actually understood my eyes, how my vision functions, and what to do in the future on a daily basis and long-term to protect my vision. They also have a pretty nice selection of frames. I was a WarbyParker only girl, but I'm now convinced you can find an equally stylish pair here (I bought a 7-for-all-mankind pair today!). If you book online, the process is even more seamless.","546":"Schmidt's would have gotten 2 more stars if the service were more stellar.  THe quality of the food gave it the third star.  Granted I was there for the buffet and didn't expect the kind of service had I ordered off the menu.  What I got however, was lacking.\n\nAfter walking in the door, the first thing I was met with when I went to the hostess' stand was the hostess with her back to me talking on and on to another employee about something personal going on in her love life.  When she finally turned around, she wasn't apologetic or acted particularly interested in seating me. \n\nOnce seated I waited for an inordinately long time before a waitress came over to take my order.  I didn't find the buffet on the menu and had to ask her about it.  So I'm getting and refilling my food, no big deal; however, my drink was never re-filled nor did she ever come over to ask if everything was alright.\n\nThen the waitress gets my dessert order wrong.  On the way to get the correct dessert, she stops and talks to the table next to me filled with three clamorous older women who were having issues....meanwhile, my dessert was melting.\n\nThen after getting some take-out from the front counter, the clerk couldn't make change correctly for a simple order.\n\nI attribute this all to hiring inexperienced staff and not training them properly.  Like I said, my meal at Schmidt's would have been much better with better service.\n\nThe food was good, and I'll be back.  I saw more experienced wait staff there so I'm sure my second trip there will be better.\n\nA side note about the three clamorous older women......While gorging themselves on the buffet, I heard all about their medicare problems, hip replacements, and vision insurance.  Once they finished with the main course(s), they ordered desserts and had them put in to-go containers, telling our waitress that they'd only eat half of them in the restaurant and take the rest home.  Ok, no problem.....until they ate the whole dessert and then filled up their to-go containers with food from the buffet.\n\nIt was certainly a memorable meal!","547":"The food was ok not very impressed, I have been to some mom and pop places while in Boston that have blew my socks off. The staff seems overly occupied so make sure you ask for what you need ahead of time.","548":"It was almost a year when I went here, but excellent staff and a great yelp deal.","549":"Five stars for the Mac and cheese with the jalape\u00f1os, chicken, and pepper jack cheese. My boyfriend ordered it today and I gladly helped him eat it. The portion was huge, but we devoured it. I wish I had more!","550":"I am an animal lover and wanted to check out one show while I was at Universal so it would seemingly make sense that this would be the one that we would make time to go to.  I read the four other reviews on Yelp and it seemed endearing enough for us to sacrifice some ride time to check this out.  It was a nice break but I found the show to be amateur at best.  I have several friends whose dogs can do more complex \"tricks\" on cue than those that were being demonstrated by the dogs in this show.  I don't want to take away from the animals or trainers but a lot of the show felt very pedestrian.  Also odd was the wide array and amount of animals that they have in the show.  There are river otters that make an appearance, a pig, a skunk, two or three cats, about four dogs,  a  duck, chickens, the list goes on and on but many of these poor things are simply lead on and off the stage.  I think that it would make a lot more sense to have two or so animals highly trained than to just have all of these other animals make brief ten second cameo appearances.  I don't want to say bad things about the show - but if you are into rides you will feel like you wasted a half hour at this.  Don't worry if you miss it.","551":"The overall experience was fair. Our experience arriving wasn't that great as the baggage claim didn't want to provide service to our luggage they broke neither did they replaced our reusable car seat bag that was tore on our first trip.\nOur trip returning, the Check-In baggage was easy and the person assisting us was extremely helpful. Southwest needs more people like him and I wished I could have remember his name (maybe Scott?).","552":"When I'm in the area near PSU and am in the mood for a slice of pizza, I head for Hot Lips Pizza.  This restaurant is their first and original location and I've been coming here off and on since the 80's.  They've earned my loyalty over the years with flavorful well-made pizza using good ingredients, friendly service, and reasonable prices.  I like this particular location because their slices are consistently good.  This contrasts with one of their other locations (which I don't go to anymore) which almost always overcooks their slices.  I can always depend on the PSU location to do everything right.  Tonight, I stopped in to see what choices they have and saw a perfect (for me) option.  This one had whole wheat crust (so I'm convinced it's \"healthier\") and my three favorite toppings: olives, mushrooms, and sausage.  Such a simple thing done just right, and I'm satisfied.","553":"I would have to say, I was a bit disappointed with what I expected. The flavor selection was smaller than most stores I've been in and the quality of the ice cream was lacking as well. \n\nThe service was good they let you sample as many flavors as you want,  however it's not the best when the ice cream is somewhat lacking. If you've eaten a lot of ice cream then you know when ice cream has that smooth, creamy and yet dense consistency and when it is a little rougher and icier than most. It's not quite as bad as some cheap storebrand ice cream's but it's not a far step above them at the same time. \n\nAll in all the ice cream place isn't bad if you are looking for ice cream in the area but I would recommend that you try harder to find other and better places.","554":"I will give this place two stars for prompt responses via text about the beginner pole dance class i decided to take. Although before i chose Allure i viewed many of the comments and saw a lot of mixed reviews. I must say i have to agree with a lot of the reviews unfortunately. The floors were dirty, shelves were dusty and especially during these times you'd expect this place to be impeccable. Instead of proper hand soap, only a bottle of hand sanitizer was provided in the bathroom. Also, as read in other reviews the place was SUPER hot. Not set at a comfortable temperature at all. The instructor explained the A\/C was not on prior and that she came to the class to turn it on earlier in the day. Yet somehow it was totally off prior to our arrival? I wouldn't say we got the warmest welcome ever. And the instructor wasn't very personable. And certainly not beginner friendly. I was looking for something beginner friendly...not intermediate. The instructor also made a comment at the end of class \"if you're just gonna stand there you might as well leave now\". Not exactly motivational. I would not return to this studio, unless they offered a true beginner friendly class and an instructor that was a bit more polite.","555":"I booked a car rental via hotwire for a car through \"Sixt\" rental company for my trip to Philadelphia, PA.  Neither company would budge on either a credit or refund for a prepaid car rental for memorial day weekend based on a no cancellation policy.  However, when the trip was booked back in early march, it was prior to all the Covid state shut downs.  My trip was unfortunately cancelled due to Covid as Philadelphia is still under a state of emergency\/\"stay at home\" order through June 6, 2020 which overlaps my original trip date.   Most other car services are allowing for either credits or allowing cancellations with refunds due to these extenuating circumstances.  What did both Sixt and Hotwire tell me?  Well, they basically said I'm out of luck and won't receive a refund or credit.  Both Sixt and Hotwire have exhibited poor customer service in comparison to other companies who provide the same services.   I would highly recommend using more morally sound companies for your booking needs.   I know I will.","556":"I'm not a huge sushi eater, but I went for lunch and got a combination meal with california roll and dumplings, and the sushi was great! and for the price, it's also a really great deal.  I would definitely go back.","557":"This is one of those restaurants that are just so so. I can't really say it was bad, but I can't really say it was great.  The few times I have been there, 2 of which by myself, and once to have some wine, it was chill, but when I walked out, I wasn't like WOW! that is some great sushi or WOW! what an experience. \n\nUnless you drive by you don't hear much publicity or promotion about Jade. \n\nStaff at Jade is nice, but not very personable, although they do want to make sure you like your food. One thing I did remember is the place having fresh sashimi which is a must! Maybe the next few times I try I will have a different experience, try it for yourself.","558":"Like many of the reviewers below I too was extremely excited about Gigi's Cupcakes. \n\nThis place offers an array of cupcakes and the selection changes daily. The creativity and the though put into making these delicious cakes are incredible. However, if your big on icing you might walk out a little disappointed. These cakes are loaded with icing which accounts for about 3\/4 of the entire cupcake experience. The price is about the same as most cupcake bakery so you definitely get your moneys worth. \n\nKids love 'em I actually overheard one say and I quote, \"All I eat is the icing.\"","559":"THIS COMPANY IS NO LONGER IN BUSINESS (04-11-2012). This is according to the messege on the voicemail from the company number. Too bad. The reviews looked good.","560":"Certainly the best Boba tea i've had in Boston and the mochi is good too!\nPrices are reasonable though be aware they only accept cash. I also like their Boston Tea Card thing though i've never gotten any benefits from it, yet!\nBe prepared for a line if it is a busy day in Harvard Square, they don't generally have working a\/c so also be prepared to sweat.","561":"They have Kentucky Bourbon Ale on tap, so I am happy there.  It is a bit tough to see TV's with the layout they have. In my two times there, I had to wait a really, really long time for a drink. Though, the food was good, bar selection was great, and it is a cool atmosphere.","562":"Literally the best Chinese buffet in Columbus!!! Great dim sum! We went later in the evening and everything was still getting replaced with hot food! Can't beat the price!","563":"Bulla Gastrobar is a Spanish tapas restaurant and bar that opened on the ground level of the Sixty11th luxury apartment high-rise in Midtown Atlanta. Bulla is pronounced \"booya\" and refers to the chatter or noise heard in the restaurant. This is a small chain that started in the Miami area. This is Bulla's first Georgia location and it opened in September 2017.\n\nMy friends and I looked forward to trying this restaurant, but left somewhat underwhelmed. Fellow Atlanta tapas restaurants like Cooks & Soldiers and Barcelona are simply better. While the service and atmosphere at Bulla were good, the food left something to be desired.\n\nParking in the Sixty11th deck is free for 2 hours with restaurant validation. The entrance isn't far Bulla. Navigate to 60 11th St NE. There's a gate at the entrance and signs that say \"No Public Parking.\" That's where you'll want to enter. Here's a photo: https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bulla-gastrobar-atlanta-2?select=U4eMtkIcu-4-ICsSr48ZPA&userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg. Validation for 2 hours is nice, especially in this part of town, but I think it would be better if parking was validated for 3 hours instead. Our dinner lasted a little over 2 hours which is easy to do at a tapas bar when you're ordering small plates and cocktails and chatting throughout the evening. We ended up being charged $10 for parking (parking costs $30 after 1 hour; Bulla validation will knock $20 off).\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful. It's modern, spacious, and stylish with warm tones and a lively vibe. There's an open kitchen, a square wraparound bar, private dining upstairs (with its own separate bar), and a sizeable covered patio situated at the corner of 11th and Crescent. Tables and seats are placed closely together so you're rather snug with the folks around you. The place can get loud so Bulla is true to its name. Restrooms are located on the 2nd floor, next to the private dining room, which is both stair and elevator-accessible.\n\nBulla serves lunch Monday-Friday, brunch on Saturday and Sunday, and dinner 7 nights a week. We visited for dinner with reservations booked through OpenTable. Book your reservation for free using OpenTable and collect dining points which you can use towards future discounts at select OpenTable restaurants or an Amazon gift card.\n\nAt dinnertime, Bulla serves a variety of cured meats and cheeses, most of which are from Spain. Examples include Paleta Iberica de Bellota Fermin (acorn-fed Iberian ham, $15) and Idiazabal (firm sheep's milk, lightly smoked from Basque country, $6.50). Aside from the acorn-fed ham, the meats and cheeses are $6.50 each with bread separate. There are about 20 small plates ($7.00-15.50 each), a half-dozen large plates ($24-39 each; some designed to be shared), and seasonal dishes like Galician soup ($9), slow-roasted pig ($23), and lamb chops ($24.50). Sadly, compared to the prices at Barcelona, the value at Bulla pales in comparison.\n\nHere's what we went with:\n\nSmall plates:\n* Albondigas ($9) - veal and pork meatballs, manchego, tomate frito\n* Tequenos ($9) - tetilla cheese, Sriracha aioli, tomato marmalade\n* Patatas bravas ($6.50) - crispy potato cubes, spicy brava sauce, aioli\n* Croquetas de jamon ($7) - ham croquettes. Serrano ham, fig jelly\n* Grilled octopus ($15.50) - corn puree, mojo verde, cracked pepper\n* Huevos Bulla ($10.50) - eggs, homemade potato chips, serrano ham, potato foam, truffle oil\n* Pintxo moruno ($9) - cumin-marinated pork loin skewers, mojo verde, Greek yogurt\n\nLarge plate:\n* Arroz caldoso ($25) - seafood, chicken, Valencia-style rice, red sofrito, saffron\n\nCocktails:\n* White Russian ($10)\n* Virgin sangria ($6)\n\nOverall, we (4 of us) independently agreed that the food was just OK. No single item really stood out to me so I didn't have a favorite, but if I had to pick one, it would probably be the tequenos which were essentially breaded cheese sticks. Both the breading and cheese were thick with the cheese being not too melty nor velvety. The albondigas were tasty though the sauce reminded me of Chef Boyardee. I wish the dish had come with more than just 3 meatballs. The portion size seemed a bit small. The patatas bravas were fine though not very memorable. The ham croquettes were good, but they were overly delicate. Each piece immediately fell apart\/disintegrated when we tried to pick them up.\n\nThe octopus was average. I much prefer Barcelona's version which is more tender, tastier, and less expensive ($9.50 vs. $15.50). You do get more octopus meat at Bulla, but it's more rubbery and not as flavorful. The signature \"Huevos Bulla\" are finished off (mixed) at your table. This dish is a messy mishmash of various ingredients, sort of like a plate of loaded nachos. I wasn't a big fan. The pork loin skewers were dry and tough and didn't seem to have a whole lot of flavor. The arroz caldoso, which means \"brothy rice,\" was like a seafood rice stew. It was decent, packed with all sorts of seafood and a savory broth.\n\nService was good.","564":"This place was honestly just okay. It's pretty chic on the inside, with the entire wall behind the bar being a giant aquarium with jellyfish and a sprawling dining room. Granted, coming from NYC, everything seems sprawling by comparison. \n\nI ordered a couple of items from the menu. Tapas are mostly in the $10-$20 range and I was worried they'd be really small at that price point but they weren't bad. I wasn't starving, so just ordered the shrimp ceviche ($11) and the gaucho bread (basically a charred pita served with chimichurri - $8). \n\nGaucho bread was good, possibly great with the chimichurri, but the ceviche was mehh. Honestly tasted more like shrimp swimming in mayo. It didn't have the finesse or acidity of regular ceviche with the delicious Leche de tigre. \n\nHad a couple of margaritas too, which were good and priced well at $9. However, I wish the drink menu had been larger and the food menu had been smaller. \n\nAll in all, decent place, but didn't blow me away.","565":"Good food. Fast service. Expensive.","566":"Food was a long wait!!!!!! Came out burnt and dry.. both times i went there was a black out. So we were quickly required to pay for our meals before it even came out.","567":"Worst sushi I've had in Vancouver. Rice is always overcooked and the vegetarian selection, even for noodles, is poor.","568":"Good German food in an endearingly silly faux-old-country setting.  Hard not to like.","569":"This is a kiddy pool, not a soaking pool. For those who think this might be a relaxing place to soak without chlorine in the water, you need to know this is not the case. Although the water has salt in it, it also obviously contains chlorine. The first part of my visit was accompanied by what sounded like a construction-grade vacuum going a few yards away which helped block out the din of screaming children with pool toys. There was quite a bit of debris on the bottom of the pool. The outdoor shower was too cold to use. The changing room is unisex with three changing stalls and wooden lockers where you can store your gear and lock it with a padlock. I would choose to sit in my own bathtub before visiting this pool again.","570":"This Round Table location is nothing like the one up on Mill Plain. Service was poor, pizza was ordered with extra black olives and came out with none. The server ran off so fast we had to finally go up to the register to get someone else's attention to deal with the issue. A few minutes later our pizza returned with black olives on top. Not cooked or even warm of course. \n\nThe building looks as if it hasn't been updated this century.\n\nWe won't be returning for overpriced pizza with lousy service.","571":"This place is horrible!  I have been twice and will not go back again. Aside from the massages not being very good, I hate how pushy they are about selling you their membership package. Both times I went I was told the massage would be a different price than it turned out to be. Also, although I went for an hour each time, my massage time ended up being closer to 40 minutes because they took me in late, gave me about 8 minutes to get changed, and then ended a few minutes early. The front desk staff are rude, uninformed, and incredibly pushy. Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else!","572":"Great place, shuffleboard and foosball at your dinner table. The bartender Bryan was awesome and even charged our dead phone for us behind the counter.","573":"I heard a rumor years ago that Julia Child listed this among her favorite Boston restaurants, and when I went looking for it couldn't believe I had the right place...until I stepped inside. I've saved two count 'em two special birthday dinners at the last minute for friends to whom I offered Carlo's as a last minute suggestion. \n\nNothing fancy, just fantastic food and friendly service. Anything you get you'll like. Go on. Go. Now.","574":"The short middle aged brunette hostess (idk her name) is a huge bitch. She seems to enjoy kicking people out, (just for sitting down when they say they're taking out!). We went one night when it was dead empty, and  got kicked out because we originally said we wanted our pizza to go, then changed our minds and wanted to sit and stay....the entire restaurant was literally empty. Sorry lady-change of heart. Not something worth kicking girls out for. Also, upon seating customers, she slams the menus down on the table and walks away without a word. Not a very welcoming hostess. \nThe pizza is good and the portions are large, but honestly this hostess is terrible and mean. And her dog is annoying AFl","575":"Update: They did contact me and offer a complimentary service which i really appreciate. Will update after the second service.\n\nReceived the hydrafacial from this centre and was extremely disappointed. I get facials every month or so from a different place and decided to give the hydrafacial at Lougheed Laser a try as a treat to myself. First the facial is $180 so you go in expecting a pretty damn good facial however the treatment is only 45 minutes because the hour long appointment has a 15 minute consult. They talk about how the hydrafacial cleanses the skin thorough and leaves the skin glowing...well that's a lie. Sure my skin looked shiny bc of the product they lathered on but in terms of cleaning...they didn't even do basic extractions well. When I pointed this out at the end of the appointment, the response was to tell me what I was pointing at was pigmentation, not clogged pores. Excuse me, I know my face, I look at it every single day. I went home and got rid of it myself after a hot shower. The customer is always right, especially if you're selling a $180 facial and the customer isn't happy with the result. I also mentioned I expected my skin to look more hydradrated and her response was to blame me for not drinking enough water...I am still nursing so believe me I drink A LOT of water every day. Again instead of owning up to the fact that her facial was not that great she blames me. At this point I realized it was hopeless talking to her. Would not recommend the hydrafacial, unless you like taking $180 and throwing it down the toilet.","576":"Do not buy your tickets online in advance. They are non-refundable! Moreover they are not even transferrable. So if anything goes wrong with your trip they are worthless unless you plan to go to Orlando again within a year.\n\nI got sick during our Florida trip and they refused to refund the tickets. After asking for a supervisor they offered to extend the validity of the tickets but I have no desire visiting a place that once they have your money they don't care anymore.","577":"I go to Fin's Sushi & Grill all of the time for both dine-in and carry-out. They have great service, great prices, and even better food. I tend to get the spicy scallop roll, which is an intense special roll and some of the best sushi I have ever had. Definitely recommend!!!","578":"Terrible terrible service. Food was not that great either. Wings were mediocre even though they were supposed to be the best thing there. Took forever to flag our server down. I wouldn't return.","579":"Yeah, not that good.  Nice people that work there, they threw in some wings to our big order but have to say we just didn't enjoy it that much.\nThe moo shu pork was the best of the bunch (at average), the medium spicy chicken in garlic sauce was a tad undercooked and flavorless - except for grease, the med spicy mongolian beef was ok  but under flavored, the shrimp sczewuan was just ok too.  \nLots of veggies in each dish which was nice and a tad more authentic but just a little too greasy and lacking flavor.  Skip the egg rolls but the crab won tons were alright.\nWe were hoping to find some great take out and this wasn't it.  It wasn't terrible but it sure wasn't good.  Portions were generous (but remember very heavy on the veggies).","580":"Amazing little salon! Th people, the product, the atmosphere, location and services are all on-point. Janet have me exactly what I asked for and an awesome scalp massage with my wash.... \n\nPerfect place to get a much-needed cut and spend a Saturday morning! I highly recommend. \n\nThis product line is unbelievable and you probably can't find it anywhere else in Boston.","581":"Only came here for my kid for the cheap price and get the job done. \nStaff not friendly. Came twice. Different person each time. Minimal English.","582":"Kaju Tofu House is always packed, which makes sense espcially in the winter when all you need is some hot soondubuchigae (spicy Korean soft tofu stew) to warm up your insides. Personally, I think Kaju does the job well enough but I still prefer BCD Tofu House in New York. The stew at Kaju is still a little thin and the spices lack a certain depth.","583":"The store is beautifully designed and can provide great inspiration. Unfortunately, the service is lacking. I've been in the store several times and whether or not someone has actually spoken to me is hit or miss. The one time I actually felt like someone genuinely was interested in helping me- she seemed to walk away after I inquired about the return policy. I only asked because we had bought a new house and I was concerned about a piece working for the space I was considering. I continued to take a few trips back to Trove but the lack of service prompted me to take my business elsewhere. Loss for them as I was certainly ready to shop!","584":"I Iove this place. Great prices, friendly people who can ask for more. Super cute little second hand store which great furniture options.","585":"Ricardo's was recommended to me by long time locals, and I must say, they were right! It's an exceptional restaurant. The restaurant is casually elegant with great parking and I love that the acoustics are well done to keep it from being excessively noisy. The food was great, and prices fair. Service (or waiter was Walter) was exceptional. We are very glad we live close by. This will be our go-to place for a romantic dinner. Highly recommended.","586":"The Pub proves to be a less than desirable experience. I went there when it first opened and remember paying about $14 for 2 small peices of fish and a handful of fries, served with a small cup of slaw. The Food took forever (about an hour)  and the server couldn't describe any of the beers or food. Over this past weekend me and my girlfriend went shopping at Polaris and started getting pretty hungry. She wanted to try the Pub since she had never been there. I agreed , thinking they might have been trying to work out some the kinks during my last visit around the opening. I ordered a pint of Harp that was hardly cold, and we split the spring roll appetizer. The spring rolls tasted freezer burnt, and you only get two (about 4 inches long) served with some taco bell guacamole that was way too salty and it was over garnished with pickled jalapenos. I thought to myself this is all you get for $6.95? They need to spend a little more money on the food and less on all the distracting decor. The bartender was a replica of the server I had last time, more interested in chatting it up with co workers than making the rounds to ensure that the guests were satisfied. If it were not a convenient stop for hungry shoppers I do not see why you would make this a destination for any occasion.","587":"Clean and nice salon. Very accommodating for a large group (5 of us). However, two of the group were unsatisfied with the hair and no efforts were made to fix them. One of the girls wanted to add a braid and the stylist brushed it off and said no it won't look good with that outfit. Overall wasn't a great experience as I was hoping.","588":"Always so delicious! The Irish (eggs Benedict with hash) is to die for! To be honest, when I ordered it I thought I was getting normal potato hash, but it ended up being corn beef hash, which I had always told myself I didn't like (I'm very picky). Well the egg was perfectly poached, delicious hollandaise sauce, and the corn beef hash- amazing!!! I don't know that I'm going to trust most restaurants to provide me with great corn beef hash, but I will always trust the breakfast club for a fantastic meal! Also, the people are genuinely great people- I remember the winter of 2015 seeing this place on the news because they were one of the only restaurants to stay open to serve emergency personnel! Thank you breakfast club!!!","589":"I had high hopes for this place because I had heard great things about it, but I have to say, given my expectations and compared to other brunch places I've tried recently, I was very disappointed. \n\nI had the omelette of the day, which had spinach, potatoes and cheddar. It was tasty but not great, and seemed quite small to me  - I've had much better recently at other places. I also asked if the server could bring me a salad or fruit instead of ciabatta. He was very nice about it but when my meal arrived, the \"fruit\" substitute was literally a couple of grapes and a few tiny pieces of fruit, all of which fit into a very tiny cup about half the size of a normal teacup. I appreciate that they tried to be accommodating but just tell me if you can't substitute something; don't insult me by bringing me (literally) not even a handful of fruit!\n \nOn the positive side, the atmosphere and service were great, and my fellow diner raved about her cassoulet. Apparently I also missed the boat by not trying the amazing lattes. \n\nI may go back and try something else on the menu if the opportunity arises (ie. if a friend chooses to celebrate an event there), but given the other amazing brunch places downtown, I'm in absolutely no hurry to return.","590":"Everybody has a story about a guy they knew whose dorm room was all black lights and liquor bottles after dark.  Remember him?  He hosted the after hours events that featured furtive drinking and uncomfortable sexual undertones.  You sat in his room and marveled at how the Dark Side of the Moon\/Wizard of Oz combination could be so life-altering?  Yeah.  Him.\n\nThat guy grew up and opened Dot's Cafe.\n\nAfter passing by Dot's on many a night, my hunny and I decided to grab a bite and a drink after our early engagement at a nearby bar. The atmosphere was immediately intriguing: low light, crazy wallpaper and velvet artwork made for a pretty trippy experience. The staff was very friendly, and even the moderate wait for a seat on a Friday evening was not particularly onerous.\n\nMy beef with Dot's was... uh... the chicken.  We tried the Pollo Platter, and that was a BAD idea.  I'm pretty sure the chicken came from a can, which is never a good thing.  As soon as the plate showed up, we were looking for the exits. Our friend ate a burger with fries, and she was as happy as she could be.\n\nBad chicken aside, the beer came cold, the service was solid, and the old-school ATM was more fun than Q-Bert on the Atari 2600.\n\nThe takeaway from this review?  Go to Dot's.  You really must experience the cool vibe.  I can't recommend it enough as a destination for drinks and conversation.  If you're looking for a solid meal before a night of drinking, just do yourself a favor and think twice about straying from the basics on the menu.  \n\nI'll now leave each of you to wonder why this particular reviewer chose to order (and then bitch about) Mexican food at a place called Dot's.  \n\nI'm still trying to figure it out myself.","591":"Jalape\u00f1o cheddar bagel with cream cheese was good, but the bagel was hardly toasted. Great ratio of cream cheese to bagel, but the lack of toasting doesn't allow for premium pliability. Next time I will ask for it extra toasty..","592":"Advertised as 'Gujarati Thali', this testaurant offers a 'Mediocre' food served in thali. However, it is NOWHERE CLOSE to Gujarati food. The basics of Gujarati food ar missing - no dhokla, no pattra bhajji, no kadhi. Also, they serve you with tortillas and name it rotis. Anyone who loves Gujarati food should never ever visit this place. You would come out with mere dissatisfaction and lack of taste. To top it further, service is too slow. You would need to wait for 5-10 mins before getting the Thali refilled, no matter how much rush is there in the restaurant. I would never recommend this place to a gujarati food craver.","593":"Came here for afternoon matinee because the movie I wanted to see wasn't playing at a closer location. I've been to Silvercity Metrotown once before in the evening and I don't really recommend it unless your idea of fun is feeling like an overdressed piece of meat surrounded by many other overdressed pieces of meat half your age.Luckily it wasn't very packed this early in the day.\n\n I was half hour early but since the Mall level food isn't readily accessible and I'd not had lunch, leaving the place to grab a quick bite to eat wasn't really an option. Scanning the lobby, apparently grabbing anything other than popcorn or soda wasn't an option either. They have a few other options for food that are stand alone off the concession but they weren't really \" open for business \" yet. Tsk. I figure if the place is open for the shows, they ought to staff all the available food options. Grabbed a hotdog. I've tasted better free hotdogs at charity functions.\n\nWent in to catch the flick. Floors were as sticky as an 80's gay bar. The cinema was in need of a good vacuum too because it looked like most of the previous night's popcorn was still on carpet. Wait a minute, was this not the first show of the day ... ?\n\nCan't complain about the show itself; I picked it and had been dying to see it for months. For the premium price of $ 15 though, I really expected more in the way of basic amenities like half assed decent food and some semblance of cleanliness. Next time I think I'll try Silvercity International Village instead.","594":"My friend works really close to Sage.  We decided to meet here for dinner and drinks.  However, I wasn't in a drinking mood.  Bummer because the drink options looked great.  \n\nI ordered the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tartare.  It was delicious but there wasn't any \"spicy\" in it.  Should've been called plain ol' Ahi Tuna Tartare.  My friend ordered a few glasses of wine, an app, and an entree.  She really enjoyed it and ended up taking half her entree home.\n\nThe ambience was fabulous.  All dark and moody, which is how I like restaurants.  The ladies room was clean and the hostesses were nice.  Our server was nice too.  Nothing really stood out but I may be back again.","595":"Tried this place out for the first time last Friday and from the looks of the reviews, it's hit or miss. My experience falls closer to the \"miss\" side unfortunately. Service was good and food was decent, but it was not great. I was in a party of 5 and the best dinner on the table was for the person who ordered the Salmon! Go figure...\n\nMy son's steak was so over cooked it was obvious before even cutting into it. The waitress noticed it and quickly offered to make him another one. He declined, but they did take if off the check. \n\nDeserts were huge, but again...nothing earth shattering. All same old same old  -cheesecake, brownie sundaes, etcs. No creme brulee or sorbets....which I prefer. Who wants a heavy desert after steak? \n\nI'm not running back anytime soon....","596":"Great food! Great ambiance. Staff seem young, inexperienced for a classy place. Slow service. It took 20 for each glass of wine to arrive. Also about 25 minutes for the food. Only the valet asked how dinner was. If you want to sit outside, request in advance.","597":"Do yourself a favor and hire someone that is mature enough, organized enough and actually knows how to run a business!!!\nThat is NOT AND I REPEAT NOT THIS COMPANY!!!!\nI was in the room when my husband scheduled the unloading moving help. And Joshua is so incompetent at running a company that he lost the appointment information ( I mean all the information!)so of course he pulled a no show. Then blamed my husband for his incompetence. So my 60 something husband and the crippled woman were left to unload a 20' truck by ourselves. I should sue his incompetent butt for punitive damages for the health issues he has caused us. \nYou would do better by hiring a couple of drug addicts.  I would be embarrassed and ashamed if he was my son or husband by his unprofessional behavior.","598":"The wings are not particularly amazing, just ok, they charged us for celery, we like extra celery which most places give us without charging us. This place charged for any celery. The ranch could have been better, and the hot sauce wings could have had a little more sauce.","599":"F*ck.  \n\nWow.\n\nSo THESE are what donuts are supposed to taste like.  \n\nYa know, if they called this place Union Square Pastries, people wouldn't be bitching about the prices.  They are just so used to spending $1 on what dunkin is pushing, they somehow think that is reasonable.  Ya know, a hamburger at McDonalds is $1 too.  You don't then order a $15 burger at Craigie Street Bistro and complain about it.  The two are related in name only.\n\nThese donuts are amazing.  I think Kane's is excellent though way too sweet and somewhat bland.  But Kane's is nonetheless the standard, and this place blows them out of the water.\n\nJust a couple of random notes.  I have tried a bunch now and the vanilla frosting is by far the best.  The donuts are the yeast kind and taste like they are baked, not fried.  They could stand to offer a wider variety, such as apple fritters for example.  Or different doughs.  For example, kane's has yeast kind and cake types - both vanilla and chocolate.   Hmm... Maybe i do like kane's more.  Much more variety.  But Union Square Donuts are amazing and $3 for a PASTRY of this quality is more than reasonable.","600":"I absolutely adore everything about Wolf's Ridge. \n\n1) First of all, it's not lost on me that this place is super accessible - lots of good street parking, and right up a really easy street. \n2) Secondly, I've never had to wait for a table. That's not to say this place isn't hopping - there's always a really solid crowd, but the space is large enough to accommodate. \n3) I am in love with community style seating. The benefit of Wolf's Ridge is that I don't have to sit with strangers if we don't want to. But the option is there, and it's really conducive to either huge groups or getting to know new people.\n4) BEERMOSAS and a fabulous brunch vibe - 'buff said.\n5) The food is really fantastic. I wish they'd change the menu up a bit more frequently, but we've always had a really good experience.\n\nI'm not a huge fan, ironically, of their beer, but I've grown accustomed to other tastes. I'm sure it's tasty, but I just choose to drink other options.\n\nThis is someplace I recommend to people coming in from out of town - especially those having to entertain clients or other big groups. Really fantastic.","601":"I'm so surprised at the bad reviews! \n\nI just went there for lunch the other day with a large group of people and the service was amazing. Drinks were always being refilled, our orders were all correct, our food all came out at the same time and hot, and the servers were very kind and accommodating. \n\nThe food was tasty! It wasn't heavy or greasy, and everything tasted great. I felt I got a lot of food for 8 bucks, and there was a great selection on the lunch specials menu. I really cannot say enough about this place. It was clean, yummy, and had a decent atmosphere. I didn't drink, but was impressed by the selection of taps and wines offered. \n\nThe only downsides: our waiter told us the \"Spicy Edamame\" was mild. It was very hot! I loved it, although it overwhelmed my palate a bit, but just be forewarned their definition of \"mild\" is not the norm. Also, I felt it was rather loud in there.","602":"He didn't fix my washing machine, instead of making a service call he told me how to do it myself over the phone.  I will be calling him next time something breaks.","603":"This place is more atmosphere than substance; but as far as sushi goes in Austin, you could definitely do much worse.","604":"The staff here is amazing! It's the cleanest facility I've ever seen. We were there for about two hours and they kept us up to date every step of the way. Just the nicest people you will ever meet!","605":"This is is one of the better Cafe located in the Richmond area.\n\nI came here on a cold rainy night with my friend and the setting are quite cozy.  Actually reminded me of the coffee shops prior to Starbucks invasion in Asia.\n\nWe ordered few drinks and snacks.  The drinks are of course, very Taiwanese style.  The Taro milkshake was quite delicious.  Silky smooth with the hint of taro . I like the overall texture of the milkshake.\n\nTheir mixed fried dish were just okay.  Not enough seasoning but still better than most of the cafes in Richmond that I have been to prior to my yelp days.\n\nTheir sandwich are the bomb!  The mayo is true to Taiwan flavor.  Simple yet good.  However, I wish they can shove off the side of the bread makes more \"Taiwanese\" Sandwich style\n\nAll in all, this is still not a place to be missed if you want authentic Taiwanese coffee\/cafe experience in Richmond.","606":"As much as I love the burger.. it's a burger.  I'm always surprised how many people are pouring out the door lined up to get one.  They are good -- very good.  Is it better than something you could put together in your backyard with a litte effort?  I'm not sure.  \n\nThey do have some interesting combinations & some interesting .  Their draught beer selection and mixed drinks are always interesting and poured\/mixed with proper care & attention to detail.  Also the shakes are awesome.","607":"Phenomenal product, everything I've tried is fantastic.  This is a charcuterie worthy of the best restaurants in Manhattan.","608":"Love it here. I've been a nail salon connoisseur for a very long time and once I had a mani and pedi here, I've never looked back. All the girls are awesome and friendly, and the pedi is the best I've had - so thorough. The place is clean and well ventilated and decorated very stylishly. Not to mention the prices are very reasonable compared to the service and prices that you get to other salons. Book your appointments early, they fill up quickly, especially on weekends!","609":"A small, cute place. Staff are friendly and attentive; food is super cheap especially considering the generous, tasty portions. The sandwich are okay but I would recommend the breakfast foods instead! It's a casual place you could bring a friend to for some cheap, good grub and an atmosphere for conversation.","610":"My first 2-star! \n\nThe interior is beautiful with the marble countertops and I loved sitting at the bar; however, the lobster roll is 1) served cold (yuck) and 2) nowhere on par with Neptune Oyster.\n\nDelicious, fresh selection of oysters from around the nation and great service.\n\nI really wish I could give it a 4 but I've been spoiled by Neptune and it can never compare.","611":"Fantastic.  Best burger I ever had.  Ambience was great and service was exceptional.  Went for magical dining but ordered off the regular menu. It's a must try.","612":"Didn't realize this place existed for the longest time, but glad I found out! I like their food a lot, but it's a bit expensive at regular pricing compared to similarly tasty offerings elsewhere. Definitely a top contender for happy hours though! \n\nBeers are varied and great. Definitely one of the more impressive tap lists on the west side and it keeps me coming back. \n\nAtmosphere inside is a little bit more 'Pearl' than I'd normally tolerate but for all its appearances it ends up being a pretty laid back place.","613":"Delicious, made-to-order pizzas on a perfect, fire-grilled crust. So many choices in sauces, veggies, meats and cheeses! I ordered a mini pizza with white sauce, spinach, basil, 3 kinds of cheeses, grilled chicken, bacon, mushroom, and asparagus. So good! Loved it so much that I regretted not ordering the 11\" size!\nTheir Marion-Blackberry lemonade was wonderful! The pizza selection process was a bit rushed and fast-paced, as it was at a busy hour, and the work area was a bit messy, but the end result was a perfect pizza.","614":"Probably the best brunch food I have ever had. Staff is amazing and really love there jobs.\n\nGreat service!\n\nEric behind the bar was awesome!","615":"Dependably good Thai restaurant in a small shopping center in Hillsdale, south of downtown and near medical center.  Quick friendly service.  We've eaten here many times now and we are always pleased.","616":"3 stars because there is no weekend service!!  \n\nRode it the Friday after Thanksgiving and the train was packed.  They should consider adding hand rails since it was standing room only. The train was nice and clean. It was a smooth ride.  Got on at the Church St. location (no parking-you will have to pay a meter or lot-defeats the purpose IMHO), but there is parking available at several of the other locations.  Got off at the Sanford location (took about an hour-there are about 7 stops in between).  There is a shuttle (seats like 6-8) that will take you to downtown Sanford free of charge and takes about 10-15 mins. If not then you will have to cab it (not sure of the $$) or take Lynx which will cost $2 each way.  Rail was timely and runs about every 30 mins or so. Round trip cost of the ticket was $5.50.  You can pay by cash, credit, debit.  Please also remember that you have to \"tap on and tap off\" at your stops.","617":"Great dinner tonight at Yak& Yeti.  Food was excellent, service outstanding, now the favorite at AK","618":"More than a coffee shop with a good selection of breakfast , lunch and snacks that can work with a keto or Paleo diet. The friendly staff was helpful to customized the Sweet & Spicy chix melt with more veggies and less carbs. Value priced, good portions, clean and efficient. The melt had a good kick and is recommended.","619":"I needed a suitcase for a trip the next day. It needed to be a certain size (carry on but still big), have certain features (pockets, not silly looking, rolley wheels, a sturdy handle) and be less than $50. I found several types with good brand names at Marshalls and picked out one for $35 and I love it. \nI think if you know specifically what you want and want it to be cheap Marshall's is a good bet for clothing and housewares.","620":"This is a cute little coffee shop with a real local, home grown feel. Reminds me of a \"coffee's on\" but less cluttered and more charming.\n\nWould be a great place for small gatherings. Just needs a sandwich shop next door and it'd be set!","621":"Terrific experience. Best part ? The joint was hoppin'! There was a diverse crowd that reflects the city - young, old, black, white. Yeah! Food was great. Wine wonderful, if limited choices. Our waiter was green, but attentive and eager to please. The complaints about the menu are completely unfounded. Where do you ppl dine?? There was a great bar menu - something for everyone, high and low - plus steak, pork, chicken, seafood, salads, sandwiches - great selection. I had chicken kebobs - wd order again. My companion had grilled cheese and fries, which she loved (a throwback to what she used to get at the Diner!). The space is lovely. Bar was roomy and bright. I sensed some were coming for the bar atmosphere, with others seeking more of a dining experience. I'm sure any kinks will be ironed out as they hit their stride. Only complaint is that it got a bit loud, but frankly it sounded more like enthusiasm than rowdiness. I hope the powers that be in Medford - who, from the stories I hear, are far better at chasing business off than attracting it - take note. Welcome back Carroll's - well done!","622":"The food was decent. We didn't wait very long for our food. Our server Omar was very attentive and helpful. The bathrooms, however, where in desperate need of help. After going to the bathroom I told my family I wasn't sure about eating her. All in all, not a bad experience.","623":"I had such high hopes when trying Burtucci's on Derby Street. I ordered the baked chicken gratinati and when it arrived it looked promising. Two bites in, I found two raviolis that were stuck together and the middles of the two were frozen solid. As for the \"chicken\", well I'm not sure it was chicken. The mysterious and identical strips of meat were tasteless and whiter than a vampire's legs in winter. The chicken was definitely not cooked anywhere near an oven or stovetop. Glad that I paid 14 dollars for a microwave dinner. Then to top it all off, the waitress ran the debit card for the table next to us, who had a bill that was triple ours. I would recommend finding yourself a different restaurant altogether.","624":"Came in with my fiance and future in-laws for a joint birthday dinner for us.  I thought it was fine but it didn't blow me away.  There were also a few inconsistencies with service.  My future mother-in-law had looked at the menu online and had picked out an entree which was not on the menu at the restaurant.  When she asked the waitress about it, the waitress insisted they had never had that menu item and even went as far as to ask her if she was thinking of another restaurant.  Just checked the online menu myself and my MIL was right.  They should probably correlate the two menus.\n\nI ordered the salmon with risotto, mostly for the risotto.  The risotto itself was heavy but very good.  The salmon, on the other hand, was a little overcooked and flavorless.  It had no seasoning on it.  In a way, I enjoyed that it wasn't weighed down with oil and butter, but on the other hand a little flavor of some sort would have been nice.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice and the bar seemed to be busy for a suburban bar.  It could be fun to hang out here again, but I'll definitely be ordering something different.  And I'll disregard the online menu.","625":"The bread at this place was fine, but the bespectacled Asian guy behind the counter really needs some lessons in customer service...management, this guy is doing nothing to enhance your brand. \n\nI walked up to the counter and the guy didn't say anything, just tilted his head in a questioning way as though to say \"what do you want\".   I asked for a loaf of rye.  \"Sliced?\"   he said.   \"yes, if you would\" I replied.   While he sliced I noticed the croissant, ham and cheese sandwiches in the case.  \"are those something that you can warm up for me?\" I asked.   The guy said nothing, just shook his head.  No \"oh, sorry we don't have a toaster\" no nothing.   Then I checked out, he didn't ask me if he could get me anything else, he didn't thank me, smile, or say another word.   The whole experience was like I was some kind of imposition on his time. \n\nOh, and if you're going to offer Croissant sandwiches with ham and cheese hours after you make them, get a frickin toaster oven.   The sandwich as it was was pretty lame.\n\nDude, you are not cut out for a career that involves interacting with clients of any kind.","626":"You don't really go to The Barking Crab for the food, now, do you?  I mean, lobsters and crabs and various other crustaceans are widely available at fishmongers and seafood counters throughout our fair city, and I'm willing to bet you have a stove, a large pot, and a vessel in which to melt copious amounts of butter.  But I'm guessing you probably don't have a large covered deck extending out over the waterfront and overlooking downtown Boston, and your home is probably not a tourist attraction nor does it have a certain piratey appeal.  The point is not the food.  The point is the atmosphere.  And the Harpoon-brewed Barking Crab White Ale.  But more on that later.\n\nMy pen-pal with benefits (oh, just kidding...my darling boyfriend) was visiting from San Francisco and since traditional beachfront clambakes are pretty thin on the ground on Tuesday nights in downtown Boston, The Barking Crab seemed to offer the most promising interpretation of the quintessential coastal New England seafood feast.  We were seated immediately at a crowded picnic table next to another party, which wasn't a problem apart from the fact that straddling the table leg was not optimal in a short dress, and from our exceptionally enthusiastic redheaded waiter ordered a pitcher of the aforementioned beer, and after some commisseration among the three of us over how many pounds of shellfish is too many pounds (or more accurately how many pounds of shellfish is just too much money for something that's half shell and will be gone in 10 minutes), a \"Venus\" platter of king crab and lobster (although, not to get too dorky on you but I would argue that if one is going to name a platter after the Roman goddess of love and beauty it should at least involve SOMETHING on a half-shell) and a clambake to split.\n\nThe lobster was perfectly serviceable.  The crab was not the greatest crab ever.  What should have been steamers were mussels and though they were open they had a worring texture that suggested they could have been cooked a minute or two longer.  The corn was what we would have disparagingly referred to in my family as \"May corn\", the potato was a potato - like, what are you going to do to a potato - and neither of us ate the coleslaw, because while in general I have grown out of the low opinion of coleslaw that led friends and I to refer to unfortunate people we knew as \"coleslaw\" (\"because nobody likes coleslaw!\" *uproarious laughter*), this was the sort of stuff that led to that opinion in the first place.  The beer, though, was delightful - wheaty and crisp.  As a pirate might say, it really slakes your thirst on a hot summer's day, arrgh.\n\nSo yeah.  It wasn't that good from an objective perspective but that wasn't really the point.  Three stars for location, location, location (and beer) and an extra one because I seem to have made it out of one of the grosser restrooms I've been in without contracting any communicable diseases.  I hope.","627":"Mango strawberry habanero infused tequila.\n\nCarne asada fork and knife burrito.\n\nHot salsa that was so delicious, I asked for a to-go container. \n\nAwesome manager that put on the Patriots pre-season game for our table.\n\nHappy girl.","628":"\"Looks aren't everything\" kinda sums up my impression of this particular confectionery establishment. While the glass windows and panes encapsulate some of the most delicious looking desserts your cavity-filled teeth may desire, the end results just were not that great. The baked items were decent, just a bit overpriced for their quality =\/","629":"Took a client out to eat here after a day of research. The food was good and there was certainly plenty of dishes to choose from so we all were able to get stuff we liked and try some new things. Sangria was ok, but not super.\n\nThe atmosphere was more like a club than a place to eat. Be prepared to yell across the table as it was so loud...and that was before the live entertainment started... I would go here to drinkl and graze with friends but not with anyone I really expected to have a conversation with. It was just too loud for any kind of table talk at all.","630":"Is it wrong to downgrade a place because breeders bring their spawn in?\n\nProbably. And I DID go to Sellwood.\n\nMy bennies were WAY sour. Far too much lemon juice in the Hollandaise. The potatoes (people, just serve hashbrowns! WTF) were undercooked.\n\nThey didn't have any problem splitting the check, but made us wait forever after they dropped the check. Do we seem not very bright? And they dropped the toast and stuff well before they brought the food. Really weird. Servers were friendly and otherwise attentive. They seemed to have a dedicated coffee pourer, too. Smart move.","631":"Excellent service and caring physicians. Got in quickly and was given valuable information during my visit. Highly recommend.","632":"i ordered les boulettes (lamb and beef meatballs with poached eggs) and tried my friends' duck sandwich and paella, and was not impressed by any of the dishes. the only thing i liked was the belgian waffle with white chocolate pistachio rosewater sauce. i don't think this place is worth the wait. or maybe we just ordered the wrong things?","633":"So I have had a problem 2xs here and only 1 good experience....so my most recent was on a Monday night when they run the special on large pizzas...I expect a hour to hour and a half wait expecially on special nights like this, especially since I have worked in restaurants for most of my life. However , this night I waited over two hours for my pizza and I live two streets over. Yes I wish I could of walked over but doing homework with my daughter and being a single mom I had no choice but delivery.I was originally quoted 50-60 mins...ok fine. After 90 mins I called and the young man who answered the phone Informed me that my pizzas were just in the oven, when I asked about an estimate on time he said I don't know when we get it out to you...I was a little shocked and just hung up...finally 2hours and 28 mins later he gets there...the delivery guys says he has worked doing deliveries for 10 years ad has never seen this kind of issue...so now the quality of the pizza....OMG I think they ran out of sauce because the sauce or tomato paste I should say tasted just that...it was smeared onto a piece of dough that def wasn't ready to be used cuz the crust was horrible.   Prob frozen when thrown in the oven,and the cheese was also gross...the heart burn the next day was almost unbearable...I loved there food before but high doubt I will be ordering from There again","634":"Great vegan food at a hole in the wall. Don't miss this place. The Shrimp PoBoy, Fried Fish sandwich and kale salad were all so well prepared and perfectly seasoned. I truly think these faux dishes could pass for real seafood. They took care to remove the seeds in the beautiful tomato chunks. You dont get that kind of attention to detail in many places. Hubby had the Rueben sandwich and was equally thrilled.  I got to taste the dill fries and sweet potato waffle fries too. Fantastic.  Friendly staff. Lots of folks getting carry out. Few tables but we were able to sit and visit and chow down for well over an hour.","635":"We stayed here for work and got a great rate!!! \n\nAs a Diamond Hilton member I am accustomed to being treated well...I like the Double Tree chain as they are infusing millions into bringing things up to current standard through-out the chain...and I am a cookie monster. Love their cookies!\n\nLocation--4 stars\nRoom size--5 stars\nBeds--5 stars\nBreakfast--2 stars\nParking--2 stars\n\nI rented a meeting room for our group for two days at $300\/day...that was bad enough until I got wacked a 22% SERVICE FEE TOO. All I asked for was water service and I have to ante up $66 for that? nope!! They graciously wiped it off my bill\nso I was a happy camper!\n\nEverything was clean and neat...some of the breakfast staff were really attentive (Carol) and the others were really bad...teeter-totter.\n\nThe parking is not owned by the hotel so there is no \"comp\" for Diamond members...the entrance is not intuitive to the hotel entrance and a bit pricey for Columbus.\n\nOne observation I had was that this hotel is centrally located to all the government offices and corporate offices in the downtown area but yet it doesn't have the appropriate higher-end feel that it should have. Its just a tad off the mark...\n\nI would stay here again until the new Hilton opens later this year!","636":"By far the best hotel\/resort\/vacation\/work-cation experience ever  what they advertised on the website is exactly what you can expect to get AND THAN SOME.  This is one of those rare occasions where the experience is actually better than what was advertised.  The location, the services, the staff, and the amenities are A++.\nThe hotel is a destination in it self.  Be sure to have at least one day to just enjoy this place before heading out to where you want to go. \nThe food is great, tried every restaurant in the hotel resort.  I don't know how the hiring process is at this place, but they have only good looking staff all around the facility... some are more model looking than a server.  Diverse nationality to service people from different countries. Very accommodating.  For the price you are paying for this is what you should expect.  Be sure to check out the SPA, it has a wondering out door jacuzzi with warm water coming down as a water fall, split gender you you can enjoy total relaxation. Everything is provided for.\n\nOnly thing I can suggest would be the coffee...\nFor a place where everything was A++, please raise the standard for its coffee.  Use better beans, and trust me on this; people who can afford to love there for a week will NOT care if you charge higher price for an actually good cup of latte.","637":"I had 4 other people in my party and they vouch for review left here.  I could see how miserable they staff felt that they had to up sell the specials that day and they chef and his team couldn't follow through.  You personally came to the table and said food will be served in 5 mins, and arrived 30 mins later.  We had waited for quite some time already with out even the appetizer arriving.\n\nTo admit and apologize makes you human,  looking at your other reviews this appears to be a recurring pattern.  Interestingly you respond the same defensive way","638":"I must say the consistency in service & quality of food is what makes BarTaco a goto for me. Just had a casual lunch and was introduced to the head chef Estabon which he was so dope. Made us feel welcoming and right at home. And no matter if it was our server Chyanne who had the brightest smile, the theme for their employees seem to be consistent. They were knowledgeable and happy and full of so much personality.","639":"After a morning of campaign work including walking in the rain to knock on doors, this was the perfect place for lunch - we showed up with about 35 or 40 volunteers and they took great care of us. I'm doing the low-carb thing right now, so no pizza for me, but they made me an antipasto salad that was delicious and just what the doctor ordered. Very friendly staff, and great food! Definitely recommend!","640":"Been coming here for years, going back to when this location was Warehouse Pools.  Yes, it's often more expensive than online, but when I need something I usually need it immediately.  If I needed some work done on my Polaris, I could always count on coming in and Casey would fix it up while I waited.  Unfortunately, I dropped off my Polaris on Sunday for what I thought would be a minor repair.  I should have suspected something when they told me it might take a few days, but I figured they were just backed up.   On Wednesday I called to ask about the status and was told they're still waiting for somebody to come in and do repairs.  When I asked what's taking so long compared to previous times I've come in for repairs, they told me that Casey isn't there anymore.   That's really too bad.  Will I still come here to purchase supplies?  Sure, it's still the closest place to my house.  But unless something changes, I probably won't come back for repairs.","641":"Some time ago one man turned to the next with the following thought: what if we could build a bento box big enough for people to walk inside? His companion gazed back with yen signs in his eyes, and thus was Sushi Yamato born - and that pretty much describes its size: about as big as an oversized bento box.\n\nFortunately for Yamato - and as people have been whispering to each other with tongue firmly planted in cheek since time immemorial - size is irrelevant, it's what you do with it that really matters. And what Yamato does with their tiny space is pack one half of it with sushi chefs and the other with hungry customers, and serve some of the freshest sushi in town.\n\nI've never had a bad dish here - they always have the freshest cuts available, and they know how to put them together in a wide variety of maki, some very much more creative than others. Fortunately, in typical style, the walls of the room are covered in full-colour photos of all the goodies so it's easier to pick. It's cheap, too.\n\nThe downside is, of course, the size - it's tiny, with only a handful of tables and bar seats. Often the remaining space is filled by hopefuls watching you eat, and willing you to do so quickly and vacate. Sometimes there's a lineup of people ordering or collecting takeout, too, and with servers bustling about among it all, the place is total chaos at rush hour.\n\nGreat sushi though, just pick your time carefully, unless you don't mind a wait, or eating in the middle of a crowd.","642":"Probably the best place you could possibly every go for ribs (if you're never planning to come to China, of course). They also do other meat-based dishes, naturally accompanied by some sort of fried potato and fried salad, all coated in sugar and biscuits. Overly-friendly service and a cheap bill = lots of fat people leaving very happy.","643":"This was our first stop during our visit in Portland. My husband ordered a coffee, and I ordered an extra dry cappuccino. Both drinks were exactly what we expected, and perfect for the cold rainy weather. The baristas were incredibly friendly and gave great recommendations regarding food, breweries, and parks for us to hit up while we were in Portland. This is a must stop if you are visiting Portland!","644":"Ok let me start by saying the fresh pasta is probably what most people love about this place, and I don't disagree the pasta is on point. The owners are very friendly, hospitable and are actually Italian which is what probably makes this place attractive. \n    Now maybe I'm being a bit persnickety but other than the pasta being fresh and the service being so great the dish as a whole had no flavor, particularly the sauce. I was a little disappointed and I feel so bad saying this because once again if my review was about hospitality I'd give it five stars. Although as someone who wants to give an honest opinion I won't just judge the food on the ability to make fresh pasta and speak Italian. There are other food trucks  like Patrizzis on manor that make fresh pasta as well and have tastier more flavorful sauces in my opinion. To each his own ,all I got was creamy tomato sauce and a hint of cheese in the Bolognese and unless the beef was completely pureed I didn't even really taste or see any, although the written menu and even the picture clearly shows beef and herbs in it. I know what your thinking everyone does it different and they are from Italy and so on ! I will give this place one more try then update my review accordingly but as for now I'm not that impressed. The bland flavorless sauce was a huge let down. When I think Italian I think big flavor like herbs and garlic but got none of that. Maybe I got the wrong dish cause everyone else seems to say this place is awesome.","645":"Unfortunately, I am unable to give a proper review based on my experiences in one of these cabs because the man who was arranging my ride on the phone was so rude to me that I told him to shove it and hung up. If I could give zero stars, I would.","646":"I really really dig this place.. you have to try the pizza here, super authentic, really great consistency and awesome flavor. I've had the marghertia and sorrentina and they were both fantastic. \nMy girlfriend once got the risotto and it was perfect.\nIt's so clear when chefs take real pride in their food.. and you can tell that's what's happening here. \nGran Gusto is one of my favorite Italian spots in Boston, along with Amelia's Trattoria and Emma's for some great pizza. \nI'm encouraging all of my favorite places to look into the green restaurant association and their green restaurant certification..it's a great way for restaurants to become more sustainable and make it really easy for consumers to see exactly what steps they've taken.","647":"This is the 3rd time in one month that I have come here for an unsweetened iced tea and they are out.  Today was 4:30p, the last time I came was at 2:30.  They close at 7.  Why is no one making more?  They don't even offer to.  Disappointing location.","648":"Celeste was an excellent bartender.  Great customer service!  While the tortilla soup was delicious, it was served on a plate, which didn't make sense.  This soup should really be served in a bowl.  The portion size was also a little skimpy.\n\nHowever, I liked the live music and it's nice to have a full bar next to the Deep Eddy Cabaret!","649":"Overall great service! Nice little thing they got going here. I had the Korean tacos: beef, shrimp, and chicken. Beef and shrimp were amazing! The chicken was a little disappointing but the awesome side of dumplings and sweet potatoes were my favorite! Haha I highly recommend :)","650":"Came here based on solid reviews for a young place. Apparently I was not the only one that caught on. The host said when I called earlier that the worst wait they have had on a Friday was 15 minutes - tonight it was an hour. The host and entire staff were very welcoming and within minutes of taking a stool at the bar we had drinks in our hands - very good original death inspired cocktails (to go with the theme).\n\nEven though it seems like a dark motif, the light lodge style decor mixed with artistic hanging leg sculptures, great lighting, and ravens perched all around gave it a kinda warm playful feel on a dark concept. \n\nDespite the estimated wait, we were seated within ten minutes (maybe they knew I was a Yelp elite haha). The menu was cool and modern - it reminded me of The Butcher Shop (On Tremont) only with more options and less expense.  \n\nWe were hungry and wanted to try everything. To start, tried the Scotch egg which was a duck egg wrapped in a fried duck sausage -weird but pretty good. We also made our own custom plate with a few good cheeses and deli meats. One of the cheese selections was not what we ordered so our waitress gave us that for free and a complementary order of the scallops for our trouble -nice touch. The Poutin special of the day was a buffalo chicken topping so I had to try that --excellent individually, but not so much piled on top of each other. The mussels were also very good in a light tomato broth. \n\nService was good, cocktails better, and food was original and interesting. Oh and after a full meal (plus leftovers) multiple cocktails and a bottle of wine the bill was not much over $100 - not bad.","651":"I really like the customization available here for the chashu amounts, noodle thickness and hardness, broth, spiciness, etc., but the flavor was just okay and the noodles too hard (I selected standard firmness). The portions were also a bit small. Service was very good. Overall, not bad but not spectacular.","652":"I had heard good things about this place, so I tried it out. As soon as we parked, I smelled smoke. Hmm, that is a good sign. We Order up pork plates and ended getting fat plates. Yeah, a very generous portion of soupy white fat with a little pork here and there. This is no exaggeration, it was awful. The sweet potatoes and corn were good, so at least I could eat that, but the \"pork\" was a total loss. I'll never go back, and do not recommend.","653":"What can I say? it's Starbucks! It's like the New York Yankees of coffee. It's absolutely amazing, the lifeblood that fuels champions. I don't think anyone on yelp needs a review from me to know Starbucks is awesome.","654":"We tried this place on a whim for my birthday last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Parking was an issue - there were valet spots outside but no valet. My honey dropped us (me and his son) off and went to park the car. The dinner ambiance was nice - they carried the candle to the table as they sat you (I like that). There is a gorgeous blown glass sculpture over the bar. \n\nThe menu had a good selection (chicken, lamb, beef, fish, and veg) and even the pickiest of eaters (my bf's son) was pleased with his meal.  I had the Greek Sampler. HUGE portion...excellent for getting a feel for this establishment's food. The guys had the kebab trio (something like that) and they enjoyed it as well. \n\nMy BF informed the waiter it was my birthday. He brought out baklava and ice cream with a honey-cinnamon topping - SO GOOD... \n\nI've heard good things about their lunch and am tempted to go check it out even though its a little out of my way.","655":"Went there for lunch today. We ordered the chop salad as well as a Pizza Margarita. The food was OK NOTHING extraordenary. I certainly expected the pizza to be a little more authentic.\nIf you are looking for good service and you live in the sandy springs area- go for it. Atlanta (in my opinion) has a lot of much better pizza places to offer.","656":"Sorry Milo's. We really, *really* wanted to like you! \n\nWe live in the neighborhood so we thought we'd break from the usual fare and support a new upstart as well. Milo's is located in the old Subway location in the spot just South of Boulder Valley Credit Union. First off, everyone who works there is very friendly. Super nice people. That's about all I have to say in the positive area...\n\nWe each had a \"Willie Dixon\" from the signature sandwich menu. For $9.50 per sandwich, we expected FAR better! There was nothing here I couldn't do at home for a third of the price. Generally, I feel that if I'm paying a premium at a restaurant, I should be getting something that exceeds what I can do as a home cook.\nThe best part about the sandwich is the relish (which has a special name that I can't remember, and I can't find their website in a search engine, although the shop does have a website)... otherwise everything else was sub-par. \n\nPros:\n- Very nice people.\n- The sweet relish is tasty.\n- The swiss cheese was pretty good, but then again - when you melt swiss, it's pretty hard for it to taste bad.\n- The bread wasn't bad.\n\nCons:\n- Not enough relish. We didn't even realize it was there until the last few bites.\n- The lettuce is shredded. For $9.50 you can't spring for some whole leaves? Maybe a leaf of Romaine?\n- The shrimp is of poor quality. It wasn't quite mini-salad shrimp, but it was not of any general quality either. When we took shrimp off the sandwich and ate it alone, it smelled and tasted \"shrimpy\" ... not good for $9.50. \n- The pickles are basic run-of-the-mill sandwich pickles. \n- Again on the shrimp -- they were just cooked -- for a \"signature\" sandwich, I would think you'd season them or marinate them or something, but nope. Just shrimp. \n\nTo summarize, this would be a pretty good $4 sandwich. But for $9.50 per sandwich -- all we did while we ate was talk about what we could have had instead for $9.50 each.\n\nSorry MIlo's! We won't be back. Best of luck to you.","657":"Went here with about ten other people for dinner and the overall experience left a lot to be desired. We ordered entrees for the table to share instead of ordering individually- including the lo mein, sesame chicken, chicken schezwan, crispy fish and fried rice... And all the food was mediocre at best. The clear winner for the night was the sesame chicken and everything else was nothing to write home about. Slightly disappointing considering that we heard such great things... On the bright side the service is relatively fast... And they seemed to be accommodating to large groups which made the experience slightly better!","658":"We had this delivered through Postmates, probably the worst ribs I've ever had. Only 3 pork ribs and 3 beef ribs per order. Both were severely over cooked. Charred to a crisp, dry, and chewy. The beef ribs were more like jerky than ribs. Good ribs should melt in you mouth. The potato salad was an unrecognizable pur\u00e9e and the mac was mushy and flavorless. $42 later and I'm still hungry. The bbq sauce was decent , but the rest was basically inedible. Hopefully I just caught them on a bad day, but I doubt I would give them a second chance.","659":"Dee-li-shus. And no, I didn't get clam chowder, I'm not a fan. \n\nI didn't want to leave my 3-day vacation in Boston without trying a lobster roll from somewhere. Just thinking about it makes me salivate even now. I've had lobster rolls in NY and other places before, but none came close to matching this cozy little food court glory. \n\nThe roll was warm, toasted, lightly buttered; the meat was fresh, cold and pure (I know imitation seafood when I taste it) like they'd ripped it straight from the lobster in the back. And it was huge. Well worth the $12-$14. It was clear they used an entire lobster, the way it's supposed to be, and it couldn't be more delicious. I will never get another lobster roll from Unos or a supermarket again.","660":"world famous? never heard of gus. never again...\nonly difference of gus fried chicken and kfc is spicy, yeah, i like spicy, but any world famous?? and beans and piece of bread, aahrrr... it's no worth a try","661":"Just moved to Quincy and had my 1st experience at the star market.   The parking lot can be a bit dicey, but inside is large and clean.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Although the lack of self-checkout can add to the wait time, the cashier I had couldn't have been more friendly or speedy.   My only true complaint about my experience here is their produce wasn't the most fresh.  Although nothing outdated, most of what I wanted to buy were starting to wilt.  All things considered, if a large supermarket chain is your thing, you won't be disappointed here.","662":"Stumbled in here with the family a few weeks ago and was happily surprised by the friendly service and very fast and tasty diner food. Nothing to write home about but sometimes you want a greasy plate of eggs and bacon with cheap coffee and your kids want some blueberry pancakes and you don't want to pay a fortune and it is nice to know this place exists.","663":"Like any dealership or contract negotiation you need to be prepared before you arrive and don't step into any car dealership with a NEED to get a new car right that moment.\nThese guys were ok and the car purchased was a good deal. I would always suggest not shopping alone and pass on any of the extra warranty and maintenance perks. You should understand what the car you are buying is worth, what they paid for it and what perks they get for selling it. You need to also understand how a dealership works and you can research that. Once you have a good idea of this THEN you are ready to start looking.","664":"I'm still not a fan but I wanted to give it another try.  \n\nFOOD: For dinner, I got their Flouder grilled which was ok.  It was a little bland and full of bones.  We came before the dinner rush so service was attentive.","665":"Called them for a short cab ride (CVS to home). They said 15 minute wait. 40 mins and 2 more calls later, they still hadn't come -- finally a stranger took pity on me and drove me home. I think they didn't think the short ride was worth it -- would have walked but I have pneumonia!!!!!! Why would I give them my business for a longer, more lucrative ride if they treat people like this!","666":"Good for the area but for ramen overal: meh. Michi, Daruma, and Ramen tatsuya are much better. The place is very chain like when you walk in, I didn't love the atmosphere despite having a super nice waitress.\n\nGranted, I enjoy this place more than Paul quis domain restaurant. I'll be back again if I'm in rockrose,  but the soup was bland and didn't love the noodles and add on choices were limited compared to other places even though they do have Brussel sprouts for an add on. Plus side: we ordered fried cauliflower and it was the best.thing.ever--- best part of the meal! It's lightly pan fried and so so so good. I don't know how they make it that good, it's way better than other fried cauliflower I've had before. And fried cauliflower is the new avocado #thanksamerica","667":"One of my all time fav food carts. Cheap and absolutely fabulous. Gruyere and ham on my waffle? Yes, please.","668":"I would expect more from this restaurant since it shares the same owner with Flour. However, all we got from the fixed menu were noodle and rice. The noodle was too oil that you can see your reflection in it Lol. It's so bad!","669":"I've been to Viva La Vegan 3 times now and I've been thoroughly impressed with the service, freshness and quality of food each time. The philly combo and shrimp poboy will make you slap your mama, but if you live through that slap, you'll be back wanting more viva la vegan soon after.  Note, both have a little kick. \n\nNo bells or whistles here. Back home in NC we call this \"a little hole in the wall\" which usually has the BEST food. Viva La Vegan did NOT disappoint.\n\nI love where this place is located because it is a testament to the fact that everyone deserves access to fresh food and healthy options. If that makes you uncomfortable then do some soul searching. \n\nThe restaurant is small and mainly a walk up to the window, sit while you wait and roll out type of place. There are 4 tables which are 1st come 1st serve, but heck, everyone is so friendly why not politely ask if you can share a table with someone who appears to be eating alone and make a new friend? \n\nI'm impressed by the service regardless of the wait. I've watched how the staff interacts with customers and they're always friendly, respectful and calm even when the restaurant is super busy. I drive all the way from Smyrna to grab something from here and will continue to do so! Can't wait to come back and try something else from the menu. \n\nNote: there's a wait because everything is made to order. Tip: be patient.","670":"The Wine Bistro has been a staple in my life for many years now; the patio is fantastic!  Over the past year or so they have added seasonal menus that never disappoint!  Last evening, unfortunately was a disappointing experience.  Our party of two ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes featured on the seasonal menu and a soup to accompany our meals.  Those came out super quick and as usual were fantastic.  Our main courses were another story; we both ordered entree salads, something that should be relatively easy to prepare.  However, they took forever!  When our food was finally delivered to the table our waitress indicated that she \"didn't want to return to the table without having our food.\"  A statement that is understandable as it wasn't her fault the kitchen was on a delay; however when she expressed that the delay was a result of a bigger party and their food was delivered it was clear that they only had flatbreads which one would assume doesn't affect the kitchens ability to prepare salads. As for the food, the Caesar with salon was prepared well.  The grilled vegetables and steak salad was another thing; one would expect a salad advertised with grilled veggies to actually HAVE grilled veggies.  It didn't.  The steak was fine but the salad was swimming in dressing....  Overall very underwhelming.  In addition to the underwhelming food, our waitress seemed overwhelmed and never offered additional drinks. Will this deter me from returning?  Probably not. But it will change my decision to eat an entire meal here.  Appetizers are always quick to come and reasonably priced but for a $17 salad with only half the advertised ingredients, I don't know that I'll be eating an entire meal here again.  And if I do, it will be a lunch or early dinner as they don't seem equipped to handle big crowds that dinner brings.","671":"Oh, my hair. I've pretty much let it go since my disappointing Keratin treatment last summer. I got sick of my highlights and started growing out the color, hoping that my natural hair would be some beautiful, never-before-seen-in-nature hue that I could flaunt without ever having to suffer the foils of the salon again. I grew out about 10 inches and soon realized that my natural color is a sort of dull, too-dark, sorta-brown blah and that I do really need some lighter color mixed in to help bring out the red that's hiding in there and to make my curls pop a bit. \n\nAlso, I'd been avoiding a haircut. I like my hair rlllll long, but I was kind of starting to feel like when people said, \"Holy crap, you have a TON of hair,\" that was more 'mystified & a little scared' than 'admiring' in their tone.\n\nANYWHO, enter Tania at Keldara! I picked Keldara because of good Yelp reviews and location and because the girl who did my updo for my birthday at 1604 (Hancock St, Quincy) couldn't squeeze me in before this wedding I have tomorrow. Tania, in short, was confident, helpful, quick, and understanding. She wasn't scared of my hair and she didn't complain about having to deal with it. She gave me great color and chopped off a good 8-10 inches of hair without making me flinch, once.  She didn't try to sell me anything, and she let me RELAX while she was working on me. \n\nWhile this place is upscale--beautiful spa, spacious waiting areas, comfortable chairs, coffee, tea, water, bakery counter, changing rooms, jewelry & products for sale in a large front room--the prices were far from outrageous. I paid $125 for a partial highlight & cut, which is what I pay at every place I've ever gone--various Dellaria's, Newbury St., whatever--but I think the spa prices are on the higher end.\n\nI'll be back. :)","672":"TL;DR - Pros: great room for the price. Cons: transportation costs to get to and from Boston. \n\nI came to Boston for the weekend and couldn't afford the outrageous downtown prices. So, this hotel (about 10 miles from downtown) was a good option at $120 a night for my room including breakfast. The room was nicer than expected. It wasn't exactly what was described (it only had one window, not two, but that wasn't a big deal). The room is modern and seemed clean and was better than other hotels I've used at a similar price. \n\nThe biggest downfall is that it's not super easy to get to downtown Boston and if you're not expecting this, it may be disappointing. There is limited shuttle service to the nearest commuter rail (Dedham Corps Center), but it's only M-F and it's not all day. So, you may have to take an Uber to and from the commuter rail station, for me this ended up being around $7 each way. It's also possible to walk to Dedham Corps, but if you're visiting Boston you'll be walking a lot, and starting and ending your day with another mile of walking might be tough. \n\nFrom the Dedham Corps Center, you'll go inbound to Boston into South Station which costs $6.75. It takes about 25 minutes. From there, you can continue on to the Red Line and you can use the T, which is a base fare of $2.25 for the subway (if you have a Charlie Card; it's $2.75 without). \n\nJust important to keep in mind you may be spending a little extra on transportation!","673":"If anyone has read my other reviews, you might know that I generally only like to talk about how great I am, but if I am going to take the time to review someone else, it is because they too, are great.  David is great.\n\nDavid is exactly what I want from a professional. He explained everything I needed explaining. He solved my problem fast. I was out a hot water heater and would have had to wait a week to get one but David figured out a way to get me one within the hour and install it. He did and I was able to take a hot shower! \n\nPros\nHigh Quality\nFaster than fast\nPolite\nDigital receipts\nStrong Communication\nSmall, local company - which is what Austin is about. \nReally knows plumbing\n\nCons\nOther plumbers are not David","674":"This place ROCKS!  The food is totally authentic and outrageously delicious.  I had the best pad thai I have ever had.  The waitress explained that the full buffet is M-W-F and they have an appetizer and salad buffet T-Th for anyone that ordered an entree from the menu. \n\nI ordered the hot jasmine tea that came in a beautiful little glass teapot.\n\nI left very stuffed and happy.","675":"Worst service. Dirty tables. Long waits with open tables everywhere. 5 people behind the hostess stand just flirting and not helping customers. \nFinally got the food. The one star is for the options on the menu. \nOrders were wrong. Never got my second drink. \nThis is the 3rd chance we have it. \nThey need to change the management to people that actually care.","676":"This is a cute little space right in the middle of the Harvard street buzz. great coffee, great ice cream, great people...odd use of space.","677":"I've been going to ranch 616 even before I called Austin home. It was our launching point on 6th. Dinner there and then throw caution to the wind on the rest of the night.\nNow that I reside here we had been going every other week. That ended last Friday.\n\nFor the second Friday in a row my group had an act so disastrously enacted on us I was awestruck. We were told that, even though we had been drinking enough fire in the holes to put many jalape\u00f1o  farms out of business, we would have to move tables because another group was coming that needed our table. I'm sorry what? Yes. With a tab over 200 dollars I was told that I wasn't welcome at the table I reserved and had been seated at. And this by their GM. He did it both time with a smug, I am-above-thee attitude. \nI'm sorry but this is not how you run a restaurant and certainly not the hospitality you find throughout the rest of Austin.\n\nI now have dubbed it Ranch 666 and will be taking my money elsewhere. Which is sad because I really like the food and drinks.","678":"We just got back from seeing Fall Out Boy, and I'm so glad we had also seen them at the Cynthia Mitchell Pavilion two days prior, because I did not like this venue at all. \n\n1. It is way too far from the actual city of Austin to be associated with Austin. We took Uber, and it cost about $40 to reach the venue. At least we didn't have to deal with the parking, because the staff that we did have to deal with were very rude.\n\n2. Ten dollars per beer is just too much. \n\n3. Ten dollars per beer and having to drink it in the burning sun is way too much. Seriously, haven't they heard of shade in Austin? We got there at 4 p.m. to meet the band and waited two hours in the heat and sun before we got to actually see them. We were pretty ripe. And then afterward there was nowhere to sit unless we wanted to sit in the sun, which I absolutely did not. Finally we found some bleachers and climbed into those and sat on the stairs. My butt is still angry about that.\n\n4. My boyfriend bought a Texas cheesesteak and threw it away, it was so awful.\n\n5. If I pay for front-row seats, I do expect to be in the same zip code as the band when I'm in said seats. Seriously, the pit area is so vast, the seats start about 100 yards away from the stage. I could've dealt with the rest of the negatives, but this was really a deal-breaker for me. I would not go back unless it was absolutely the only choice.","679":"This review is a bit late, my husband and I were here I think 2 weeks ago? My husband had the farmers omelette and I had the farmers potatoes,  we shared our dishes and both of us agreed the farmers potatoes are the best, the omelette was good but the farmers potatoes won us over.\n    It was my first time here so I gave them 4 stars I would return the food is awesome, the portions for the price could be a little bigger.","680":"This is now my go to shop for all my spices. I was given a package of spices as a gift and loved them,  now I'm hooked. They have a large variety of quality spices to choose from, prices are very reasonable. They also carry a quality local olive oil that I was looking for. Wonderful customer service!","681":"Hotpot! Come here for the sichuan hotpot, not the sushi. \n\nIf you are up for a spicy meal, order the sichuan spicy soup and have them make it with the extra spice. You have a choice of either a pot split in half or split into nine sections. \n\nA large variety of hotpot items are available, including rarely seen ingredients shown only in chinese like pig's throat and duck's intestines. \n\nPrice is closer to $$$ than $$. Soup itself was $20 and pushed our bill for 5 people to $210. Also note that they only take up to 3 cards, so if you have to split for the 3 ways bring cash. \n\nThey do not take reservations so it's first come first serve. Parking is available in the back and on the street (free after 6pm).","682":"My two year old dog LOVES this place, and is always exhausted and happy when I pick her up after her play days.  I'll happily drive across town to let her run and wiggle with all the other dogs.\n\nThe staff are really friendly and seem to love the dogs, and are sweet with my little pup. Its run by the same people who own Raining Cats and Dogs in uber-bougie Huron Village, so they stock hippy-bourgeoise holistic dog food and toys, etc. They also have an in-house groomer who is really sweet and did a great job when she groomed my dog. \n\nThe per-hour rate might be on the pricey side, but a whole day is only $30, which is completely worth it to me.","683":"I was looking forward to trying this place. All my friends rave about it and it looked interesting. I really wanted to like their stuff. \nThe location is really good, right in the center of the Common which ideally makes it a great place to grab a bite or have a snack. \nI ordered a chicken sandwich that arrived cold. I don't like my chicken cold. Terrible! The sauce was fine but the sandwich in all was mediocre. Such a disappointment.","684":"This place is a one stop shop for all things nutrition and supplement.\nThey make protein smoothies, they sell food already prepped and measured and ready for those who want\/need it.\nAmerica needs a place like this. FOR REAL.\nALL your nutrition and supplements, vitamins and then some, but also get your drink\/juice\/smoothie\/protein shake and a meal.\nI was really surprised when I came in here.\nI wasn't expecting something like this. The guys that worked there seem to know their stuff!!\nNext time I am in Vancouver, this is a MUST STOP shop for all things health and nutrition! :)","685":"Wandered over to give this spot a try as it gets decent feedback on Yelp. \n\nPerhaps because it was a Sunday but the latte just wasn't good. I guess I'm a latte snob of some sort because when I see them available in multiple sizes I just cringe. \n\nIt was explained to me ages ago that lattes should only come in one size in order to maximize the flavour of the espresso and so when faced with a spot that offers multiple sizes I aim for the second smallest one in the hopes it will meet my expectations. \n\nThis one did not. \n\nI prefer Kafka's and Matchstick for this very reason, but if anyone has any other spots that meet my requirements please let me know.","686":"I wish 0 stars was possible. I just waited 30 minutes for a fry and milk shake. Get to the window the fries were cold and the milk shake was melted. Then the girl in the window had the audacity to have an attitude because I asked for a new one. This McDonald's needs to shut down!","687":"Great place to grab a bite. I had a chicken Enchilada and it was exactly what I was looking for! The service was great but the road near by is pretty busy. After I ate at Flavia's I was not worried about desert because the portion was very filling. All in all if there's a taco truck I'm looking forward to visiting it's definitely Flavia's","688":"I've been to many massage therapists. I have never had what I would consider a BAD massage... But this was, by far, one of the best massages I've ever experienced! Jasmine is not only very well trained, she's one of those rare therapists who just has a knack, an innate sense, of where you're hurting and how best to work out those sore spots. She listened to me describe where I was hurting, but also addressed areas I was completely unaware were sore until she worked her magic! She'll adjust her pressure, but I didn't need to ask her to, as it was perfect from the get-go. There have been times, more often than not, where the therapist will make me secretly wince. I've always just dealt with it, as I've assumed that it was the only way to get the deep tissue tightness addressed. I didn't secretly wince with Jasmine... And it's a week later, and I've never felt so good a week out from a massage! \n\nGive her a shot! I promise, you will NOT be disappointed! And I'd place bets that if you try her out and you're someone who likes to have massage work done regularly, she'll become your go-to massage therapist!","689":"The food here was amazing, everything has a very strong, delicious flavor and is nicely presented. I also enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was very good. I got the carpaccio, tempura, and kakuni--all of which I recommend. I can't wait to go back and try more!","690":"The food was soso. Prices were very good and I like the new furniture compared to the old Cronos. The lamb was a somewhat dry but the owner will never know since they never asked me how my meal was.  Roast potatoes were plentiful but bland. I asked for butter...waiter replied \"No butter.. olive oil\". Guess he got a little pssst at me since he came back 10 minutes later \"I found butter for you\" Plopped it down and  turned away before I could say \"screw you\". The greek salad was delicious. Will I go back? Sure,  but I'll take my own butter with me.","691":"I ordered something at the beginning of April. Here we are at the END of April and not one update since Newgistics took possession on April 11, 2020. They have no way, other than a phone number, to contact them to find merchandise. Someone else I know ordered the same merchandise on the same day and they haven't heard anything either. How do companies get away with this and how are they still in business?","692":"We caught these guys in Denver on their cross-country trek.  Not only do they make gourmet grilled cheeses, they're hella cool as well. \n\nIt turns out they had a foie gras, port salut with walnuts and cherry compote I believe - a sandwhich they \"threw\" together just for Denver.  This was probably the best grilled cheese I've had.  Absolutely butt-smackingly delicious.  The Mrs. and I also split the duck prosciutto, goat cheese and fig, and unfortunately I just didn't care for the goat cheese.  I don't think goat cheese makes for a very good grilled cheese, so sorry guys.\n\nBTW, day 2 they didn't have the foie gras anymore.  Thank goodness we got to them on the first day!\n\nStay cheesey my friends.","693":"This place is awful. Don't waste your time. There's a sweet chicken dish and a spicy chicken dish. I got the spicy chicken dish that's supposed to be topped with spicy Korean BBQ sauce. Nothing about the sauce tastes Korean. It was basically some watered down red sauce and then a bunch of sriracha on top. There were only about 5 tiny pieces of chicken in the dish, some onions and bell peppers, and it was 85% white rice. The white rice didn't even taste good. Probably one of the worst food stands I've experienced in Austin.","694":"If you are black stay away, I was standing in line were i was next to be help, sales associate look away from me ask person in back of me can she help him, seeing I was only person of color in line. Even the customer laughed at me. WATCH YOURSELF HERE THEY ARE JUST PLAN RUDE RACISTS PEOPLE WORKING COUNTERS. The fact that I reported it and heard nothing proves my point Hell the can even watch the secuirty montiors to see that I was not lying. BLACKS STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!","695":"I have been here twice with my coworkers ever since I started working near the area. My coworkers rave about this place and come at least once and up to three times a week which in this industry is deemed \"a regular.\" They are usually in and out within 40 minutes.\n\nThe first time I got Pad Kee Mao with chicken which was good but a little too spicy for my taste. The next time I got Pad See Ew with chicken which was decent but not the best I've had. It's not the lunch specials that make it so good in my opinion, it's the all you can eat complimentary salad bar that comes with dining in (and specifically not for togo customers). They change it every day. It typically includes 2 soups, various fried foods (e.g., eggrolls, tempura, dumplings), spring rolls, salad, and dessert. So for $7.95 (price noodle dishes I have eaten there), it's a great deal.\n\nI don't expect great service from Asian restaurants but just the bare minimal from here. The service is typically pretty average, not the best but not terrible. But when I went the second time with my coworkers during our 1 hour (from 1pm to 2pm) lunch break, I was very disappointed with our service. My coworkers usually order their food around 1:15pm, receive their food by 1:30pm, but today it arrived fairly late. We do understand sometimes it may take a little longer to make food especially if the house is full (which it was not), so it wasn't that big of a deal. Everyone else's food arrived a little before 1:40, but mine did not. The server \"confirmed\" what I ordered after everyone already received their food, which I would assume she placed the order wrong. So I waited another 5-7 minutes to receive it. During that time, since we were in a rush to get back to work by 2pm, we asked to get togo boxes and our checks so we could prepare to leave in case we could not finish the food before 1:50. The manager\/owner then comes up and tells us that they usually don't give big togo boxes but they'll let it go this time but then went on to warn us that next time they would not allow us to do that...\n\nFirst of all, my coworkers come every week and dine there. They should not have assumed we were freeloading off the salad bar ESPECIALLY if they dine there every week. Honestly if they don't even know their faces by now, shame on them. Second of all, it was THEIR fault that the food came out slower, and they messed up my order. To have the nerve to warn us that next time we can't do that was highly offensive. If they could have just asked us why we needed togo boxes instead of assuming we were just eating the salad bar and leaving, we would have been on our merry way. But to accuse us of something we've never done and know we're not supposed to do, made us all pretty angry.\n\nIf the food is amazing and service is bad I will go back. The food here is alright and service was bad. Needless to say, we will probably never come here during our lunch hour again.","696":"I tried working with interent sales at this dealership. I attempted to upload some photos of my trade in car as I live 120 miles away and didnt want to drive over if I knew their trade in amt wouldnt be serious. There system would not accept any photos and their system also did not allow them to access any outside websites. This is an INTERNET dept? I dont think they were interested in working with me and I would have to wonder about folks who buy here..........Price  must not b e an object.","697":"I'll start this with saying I'm only reviewing the event space attached to the dealership. The space is really big, has nice bathrooms, though only one toilet per room, no stalls. For an event this is a problem. There is a food area to bring in your food prep and serve as well as some high stools and tables to sit at. There is a lounge area and seating there as well with big screen tvs. \nParking is a huge problem.  All the overflow cars from the dealership are in the lot behind the event room. This leaves you with street parking which for us ended up being on the other side of the dealership 3 blocks away! \n\nI wouldn't be back for another event here, especially the fashion event that was the reason for me going there to begin with. That was a complete waste of time and money. Who goes to an event that starts 2 hours late!","698":"Really cute place but everything was so salty! Saltiest hollandaise sauce I've ever had (I got the Paris Texas Benedict) and saltiest breakfast potatoes. My girlfriend had the same compliant about her meal (she got the Austin American Classic). Seems to be a theme in Austin that hotel restaurants are lackluster. Service was good, but probably won't be coming back.","699":"Ok, had I the possibility to rate and review this 12 yrs ago, this would have been different. It \"Used\" to be a great spot for Latin food.  Anymore, the place has just disappointed my wife and I. She used to go there before we even met, 15 yrs ago. We've been there four times since we've been married, 13 yrs, and each time has been worse than the time before, the food has lost it's merit, the owners are not the same and this may be the reason for the lack of care taken in the kitchen. If anyone can or should be able to make a Cuban sandwich, a restaurant calling themselves, \"Cuban', should be able to pull it off...it saddens me, as we live around here and love Latin food. Officially, they really should rename their restaurant to, 'Numero Dos'.","700":"I'm giving them 2 stars because of the food and the fact that there was a major safety hazard that they've been alerted to numerous times. I broke my foot this morning and am currently wearing a boot. Their floors are different from typical floors and when water gets on it, it is very slippery. Wearing a boot made my balance even worse. There was water on a good 6 ft area at least and the servers were aware of this. They've also gotten several other reviews from people that have slipped and fallen. This needs to be addressed by management. \n\nOn to the rest of the review. The servers were nice and attentive to us, but the food took a ridiculously long time to arrive. We watched tables that were seated after us receive their food first as well. Portion sizes are small, so my son and spouse left feeling hungry after a $17 hamburger\/fries. They felt that the hamburgers were ok, but not special. My daughter loved the vegetarian orange chicken with spicy rice. She felt that it was really spicy, but still enjoyed it (the only reason I didn't give them 1 star). I ordered the Lobster garlic noodle dish and was very disappointed. It actually comes with crab and shrimp as well, but the shrimp was overcooked & rubbery. There were several shells in the dish and it was flavorless & very greasy. I ended up bringing 80% back home and am going to try to add cheese and some spices to the edible parts of it. \n\nSo, if you don't mind overpaying to wait 45 minutes, falling on your rump and feeling disatisified with your meal...then this is the place for you. We will personally never return.","701":"CorrectMed should be ashamed!  Let me start by saying what other reviewers have; Dr. Doyle and Dr. Goo are amazing practicioners who go above and beyond to serve their patients and their community.  They originally contracted with CorrectMed with the understanding that it would take some time to build a pediatric clientele, and Correctmed was on board.  That was until correct med decided that money was more important than quality of care.  They fired Doyle and Goo when they voiced their concerns that switching to an all ages Urgent Care was not in the best interest of the practice or their patients. We did not find this out until our 6 month appointment, when we arrived to find that Dr. Doyle was no longer there. No one had contacted us to let us know prior to this.  Even worse, they still claim to be a pediatric facility eventhough THEY HAVE NO PEDIATRICIAN ON STAFF.  The nurse practioner that we saw had no idea about the names of the vaccines that my son was to receive.  She also had no idea that one vaccine was given in oral form, and multiple times stated that my son needed vaccines that were not on the normal schedule.  CorrectMed is now a scary place to take your children!  \n\nFor those looking for Dr. Doyle, we will be following her to Pediatric Health Center of Conyers.  We are willing to drive 30 min. each way to remain patients of this amazing physician.  It is our understanding that Dr. Doyle would like to open a practice in the Oakhurst\/Kirkwood Area, but is not able to because CorrectMed is holding her to a 2 year non-compete.  How do the owners of CorrectMed sleep at night knowing about the quality of care now received by their Decatur patrons?","702":"I learned about Modern Pilates through a Gilt City offer, and was really glad to find it.  I did Power Pilates in NYC for 6-7 years & loved it, but when I moved to Boston, I was not able to find a studio where I got as good of a workout.  I've now taken 7 Tower classes with Shelley, and she is amazing.  Her classes are really tough, but so focused on form, that you know you aren't going to do anything that hurts your body. The classes are always small, so you get lots of private attention.  My only complaint is that there are not a lot of classes offered (3 tower classes a week I think), so it's not super convenient but it is by far the best studio I have found in the area.  I highly recommend.","703":"What can I say that, I'm sure, hasn't already been said?  When you're entertaining out-of-towners looking for a \"real\" Boston experience (or when you want a sit-down meal a stones-throw from the Children's Museum) this will definitely fit the bill.  \n\nI don't know that I've had any complaints about anything I've had - it's all been perfectly adequate.  The crabcakes I had at last visit were probably the tastiest thing I've had there - a shame, considering they were almost absurdly small.  But the servers are game to teach crustacean virgins how to eat a lobster... hands on.  And isn't that what you're looking for when you're bringing your extended, distant family out on the town in Boston?","704":"Visiting Salem & looking for good lunch eatery. I read the reviews for the art museum cafe & we decided to try it. Hubby had his  backpack searched & couldn't bring it in the museum even tho we were only going to the cafe, which is ok in light of recent events. I had the salad special: spinach, prosciutto & melon & piece of cornbread. Hubby had a basic Chicken Caesar. Both salads had to have been made DAYS earlier. The melon in my salad was mushy. Mushy melon! The cornbread was awful. Husband's salad wasn't all that great either. Really expensive for the food we ate. I don't know who gave this cafe such great reviews. It was awful.","705":"Ok, I know...most people are going to say why am I giving 4 stars to republic.  \n\nWell...it's because i like it.  Let's look at your typical club atmosphere.\n\n1.)  Long Line ups where you might not get in\n2.)  Unfriendly bouncers that don't smile or acknowledge you (hey they have a large crowd of rowdy people to control so maybe they have to look tough.)\n3.)  Not enough girls (if you're a guy) and a lot of douchebag aggressive guys that think they can get sex for the price of a drink (if you're a girl)\n4.)  LOUD Music\n\nWell, here's my analysis of Republic.\n\n1.)  Long line ups only exist on the weekend.  I'm usually here Sunday to Thursday and there usually is no line or a very short line.    \n2.)  I can't agree with unfriendly bouncers because, well, after going here so many times you get to meet them and most of them are pretty friendly if you get to know them.  Sebastian and Tazer are really good guys at the front and so is Johnny, Derek, Quinn and Cam.  All the bouncers are usually dressed well (have you seen the bouncers at other clubs?  They are dressed in muscle shirts to look intimidating.  Here the bouncers are dressed..actually very professionally and are friendly when you get to know them.) \n3.)  As for the girls and guys, well...it's a club.  There's always enough women around and I'm apologizing for most of the guys because that's how some guys are in the club.  It's only a few bad apples that cause the whole bunch to have that rep.  But women with their protection shields usually do a good job of weeding them out.  I guess depending on the night the girl to guy ratio might have more guys to girls, but I find its generally even most nights.\n4.)  Actually, the volume is not that bad I find.  I've left this club to go to other places and Republic's level is actually still loud enough to dance to and quiet enough to have an intimate conversation with someone.  \n\nWhat I like about this club the most is that you have two rooms and two different vibes.  Sure sometimes it might take awhile to get into the Hip Hop room (AKA the Annex) on Friday and Saturday but the fact is you'll eventually get there and if you don't, the main room still is playing pretty good music and there is a different vibe between being downstairs and upstairs in the main room too.  \n\nRepublic is like two or three night clubs in one that way.  Instead of bouncing and paying cover at another bar or club, you can just move rooms and get into a different vibe.  The drinks are cheap from Sunday (except on long weekends) to Wednesday with most high balls under $4.  \n\nThey try a lot of different things to make this club work.  One time they hired the Vancouver Circus School to perform at the club and it was like being at Cirque du Soleil with performers falling and climbing up ribbons in the bar, a dancer inside a hoop suspended from the ceiling and a guy walking on stilts.  That was magical.\n\nI love watching the bartenders work here, especially on the ground floor.  See my photo of one of the bartenders lighting the bar on fire and blowing fire.  Tommy is also a good bar tender watching him juggle liquor bottles and cups that guy actually loves his job and it shows.  I'm very impressed.\n\nMost of the bartenders are nice to talk to  and same with the coat check ladies when it's not busy.  \n\nOnce in awhile you can find free cover tickets from promoters on the street or at least discount tickets.  \n\nI guess the one caveat you have to be aware of if you are a guy is to never bring a girl here unless you have her locked down.  \n\nI one brought these three girls I met to Republic here from another bar on a Friday night.  It was cool except for when we went into the hip hop room and the bouncer there crept up from behind and pulled her away from me when I went to buy them drinks at the bar.   And she was holding me around my waist when I was leaning against the bar too.  I turned for a second to buy a few drinks and the bouncer pulled her off me.  After I'm standing with her friend looking at the, with one extra drink while he gets her number and I'm thinking WTF?    (Hey, he's a bouncer and I'm just a patron but wow, seriously?)   Ever since then, I tend to avoid bringing girls to this bar.  That's the only bad thing I have to say about this club.  \n\nBut then, another time another bouncer actually helped me pick up a girl and this other time I was really glad that there was a bouncer around when some jealous guy tried to pick a fight with me for talking to his \"girl\" (she never mentioned that she had a boyfriend!)\n\nI could keep writing on and on, but I would say just to check it out.  Especially on the weekdays (you'd be surprised how busy it gets on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.  I like the music here better on Wednesday's but it typically doesn't get busy until real  late Wednesday.)","706":"Food 3 stars. Service not even one. Worst service ever in a Korean restaurant. No smile at all kimchi comes later than main dish. Will never come back.","707":"We have been here before and it was moderately acceptable. I can only imagine that something very very bad has befallen the kitchen staff since that time. Our poached eggs were hard, not runny. My ricotta toast was completely unseasoned. Even our server seemed confused - as if she had stumbled into a room and given an apron without any instructions as to what she was expected to do. I can only assume she is an unpaid volunteer that thinks she's at a soup kitchen. Don't come here unless you really love the concept of a bread line.","708":"This place was disgusting. If I could give it 0 stars I would. My friend and I got lunch here and my hibachi was just okay, nothing I would order again, and my friend's sushi was absolutely gross. She was served the wrong rolls at first (but she ate one piece), after the food runner was told about the mistake we witnessed him get his ass chewed out by the (who I am assuming is the) manager, then the manager ran the food that my friend ate off of. When she got her right order the rolls had bad avocado and brown stuff in the rice. Needless to say she got her money back.","709":"It's a dive bar, the only thing sweet about this place is the location cause it's right on the river. Other than that. I have a hard time returning to this place. I've now been here a handful of times to be able to judge that everything especially the service SUCKS. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is the sweet location with an outdoor patio. The other time that was memorable for me was when I got all excited to come here for brunch with family that was in town and getting breakfast burritos and French toast took 55min... The handful of times that I've been, it's been a disappointment. The food is okay, but service man, they need to care a little more. Try to maybe have more than 1 person working on a Friday night, it was so bad this last visit, I saw a guy bussing his own tables, yikes  ..","710":"This place is such a mess!!! \n\n1. The workers claim they \"do not work there\", or for a different location and act like they are so confused with ringing up your clothes-very unprofessional and lacking integrity \n2. The workers BAD MOUTH the owners-even more unprofessional and unethical \n3. I dropped off clothes at 8:30 am, meaning they would be ready that same day by 5:30-which is a lie, and my clothes were not ready until AFTER they were supposed to be closed for the day-by boyfriend went to go pick them up and was treated with so much attitude \n4. Two shirts were missing and the workers are trying to blame my boyfriend for not knowing where the shirts were, when they had no idea where the shirts were-YOU WORK THERE. Luckily, they found the shirts much later-yes, after they were supposed to be closed.\n5. For the attitude and trouble we went through, never going back and paying SO MUCH for dry cleaning","711":"OH MY GOODNESS. So good.\n\nI am never a huge fan of pancakes... BUT their pancakes were AMAZING.\n\nMy friends got a berry cobbler pancake, and the white chocolate and both were just heavenly. Fluffy, and there was granola mixed into the batter which gave it a nice crunch every now and then for texture. WOWZA.\n\nThe Mimosas, and Bloody Marys were good obviously. But they had a special called 'summer...' (something like that) with egg whites. It sounded disgusting... but tasted so good!!! It was basically a very smooth tasting mint mojito. Definitely try that.\n\nI had the spanish scramble which was good, nothing to write about. But decent. Long wait, but honestly worth it.","712":"Once I saw my hair in the mirror under the sunlight... Oh my, how did I end up like this?","713":"This is one of the better locations however the whole company has gone down the drain. They use to have an iced tea cart that the hostess would push around refilling your tea, Now they have these people that call themselves servers that pander for tips... Let me get this right, I pay for my own food, i bring my own food to the table, I place my own order, these people do nothing but harass me... \n\nThe food is also now over priced I paid $12 for a piece of fried fish some instant potatoes and scoop of corn w tea... Way overpriced... \n\nThe Food Server issue really pisses me off so much so that I do not ever eat there unless my Grandmother drags me into the place. \n\nThis must be what prison food tastes like, They dump Bacon into the green beans!!! How can vegetables be healthy with dead pigs floating around in your green beans!!! \n\nThis place is sooo screwed up!!! They need to get rid of the useless servers and go back to the ice tea cart stop pandering for tips and start paying your employees a decent wage you are way overcharging for your food do you expect us to pay your employees for you to??? \n\nOh yeah and when I called to complain they only have a recorded voicemail, no real person to speak with... This company has fallen apart!!!","714":"This place is not run efficiently.\n\nThey aren't open when they post they will be, or even if the \"Opened\" sign is street-facing. This causes issues with picking up clothes in a timely manner. \n\nThey forgot about my order. OK, things happen. They told me to come back on a Saturday to pick up a pair of pants. I came in and she had no idea what I was talking about, couldn't find my clothes. Ultimately I ended u seeing them on a shelf in the back and pointing them out. They hadn't been touched. \n\nWhen I went back to pick them up again, one out of the four pairs of pants I dropped to get hemmed hadn't been touched. I went back the next day to show them, and get them hemmed, and they were closed - even though it was during posted hours!\n\nFind somewhere else. It's not efficiently run.","715":"I don't understand these positive reviews.  Maybe it is better for dinner, but twice now, we went for lunch.  There were just a few people in the dining room and the rest in the bar.  This was a Saturday.  We ordered French toast and a salad.  Salad came, no French toast.  Then the French toast came and it was raw in the middle and very little pieces of bread.  It then was suggested I get one pancake as a substitute and it came very dry.  Very dissatisfied we paid for something that we were not satisfied with.  I will say the French toast was taken off my bill.  This is not the first time I was not happy with the food here, but thought I would give it another try.  We won't be coming back.","716":"This place doesn't look like it is child-friendly -- the high chairs and booster seats are hidden behind the scenes -- but within a minute of sitting down the server brought us a high chair, whisked the chair it replaced away, and brought us a large plastic bucket full of toys.\n\nThe caveat to this place is - either go during off-peak hours or count on a very leisurely pace.  The server was quick, efficient and friendly, but clearly overworked as the place began to fill up for the lunch hour crowd.  Similarly, I suspect the kitchen is short-staffed for peak hours.  However, the food is good and they have a decent selection of teas, chai (dragon fly brand, I think, 3 types), and espresso (which I haven't had).  If you need something quick, ask for a scone, pastry or similar item until the main order gets there.","717":"Three of us stopped in for dinner around 7ish on a Friday night. We expected it to be packed considering the day and time, but we were seated in just a minute or two. The decor is nice, but a little strange to me. It's a mix between an Italian restaurant and a sports bar. Don't get me wrong, it's very nice inside, just a weird combo.\n\nAnyway, the menu has a lot of options to choose from; from traditional Italian dishes, to burgers, to pizza & calzones.  I had the pizza burger, and an order of fries. The burger was good, not mind blowing, but pretty tasty. But those fries though!! The fries are more of a fair style. They seemed to be fresh cut, and were absolutely delicious.\n\nSo, you've read this far, and you're probably wondering why I'm only giving it 3 stars?! The service...oh boy...the service. Look, I try to give servers the benefit of the doubt most of the time, especially on a Friday evening, but I can't do it this time. I'm pretty sure our server was new, but still. It took every bit of 10 minutes or so to get 2 beers after taking our drink order. Then, probably another 10-15 minutes to order. I'm thinking it was close to 40 minutes after that when we finally got our food. The server did stop by once during that time to tell us that the \"kitchen was slammed\", even though there were still open tables and plenty of open seats at the bar. I'm not sure what the delay was, but at least our food was hot and good when we finally did receive it.\n\nIf not for the service, I'd say 3.5, maybe 4 stars. I'm sure we'll give it another go at some point. The fries alone are worth coming back for!","718":"Really rude employee. I asked this girl if I could use this coupon and starting getting angry at me. I had never used dd perks before and was confused because there was no barcode. She pulled up the price and it was $3 but the coupon is for $1.29 coffee so I ask why. Rude, she says \"just scan your gift card\" I did. Later she asks another employee to accuse me of taking banana without paying. It was a really bruised banana that I had dropped a couple of times and looked nothing like the bananas they would sell.  Just angered me how rude she was. The employees no longer working there were much better.","719":"We stopped by here as a large group late at night and were seated after a short wait. A server helped us once we were ready to order. Service was fast. We received all our food and drinks within 15 minutes. However, our server did not understand the term \"no greens\" for the beef noodle soup and punched in no pickled veggies and forgot to punch in thick noodles for the same order. That was the only order out of seven that was incorrectly entered. She seemed very sincere at rectifying her mistake and offered a new bowl of noodles to be made or bring out a bowl of thick noodles. My other half declined the offer as he did not want to wait for the food after everyone else had received their orders.\n\nThe food was fairly decent. I think their strong point is the Taiwanese items. The rest are a hit or miss like the xiao long bao. The soup dumplings had skin too thick and not enough soup. I was impressed the dipping sauce contained slivers of ginger as even more authentic places do not always offer that. I was content with my snack size portion of marinated minced pork and rice. If only there was a marinated egg to accompany my rice and it would have been perfect. The drinks are solid. My milk tea could be customized like most drink places for sweetness and ice. \n\nLastly, we were surprised the staff removed the beef noodle soup from the bill. I would not expect this type of service at any Asian restaurant. Service was great. The fact the staff actually tried to make up for their mistakes mean that they found some returning customers. As this restaurant is advertised as Asian fusion, I recommend ordering Taiwanese items first and then decide on the other items accordingly and adjust your expectations.","720":"We've been to Cha Ba Thai a few times now.  The food is the reason we come back.  It is quite good.  Every plate comes to the table sizzling and hot.  It's worth going for the food.\n\nThe reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service.  They are not rude or anything but simply no smile and no greetings.  I am not sure why that is but that seems to be the case every time for some unknown reasons.\n\nHighly recommended for the food. :)","721":"I'm a technology supplier Helped them out with drives and more they chapter 13 after the 5th order and refused to pay me  I not a good Idea to do any type of business\nwait untill a new company takes them over I'll kiss 25,000 good bye","722":"My family frequently visits Green Apple, and it is a great experience for the price- \nI would like more fresh fruit, but they generally have strawberries and blueberries.\n\nIt is always clean, and the people are friendly.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that they now only have one size of cup, which makes it easy to get more than you planned, especially for the kids. I likes the smaller size cups that they used to have.","723":"All I have to say is, LOL what the fuq! Went here with a brunch of friends because I was pumped about chicken and waffles. What a mistake. Firstly, the food. The waffles were pretty good, fluffy and sweet, but very thin. The chicken was black, humongous (like, seriously, radioactively big), and unbelievably bland. Instead of butter, we were served a crapload of margarine. We ordered habanero peppers but got jalapeno poppers instead. You know, whatever, we didn't complain and just order another order of habanero poppers. Both of which were disgusting. Spicy, yes, which was good, but the overfilled cream cheese and burnt flour coating was just nasty. I got my order fairly quickly (20 minutes) for it being fried chicken (I'm being generous here) while my friends were another story. And here is where the insanity of service comes in.\n\nOK, so bro had a bad day\/week\/life so we listened compassionately while he was talking about the fuqed up misadventures around the cart and how he was going to quit after tonight -- which was sad because he seemed cool and kind of funny. But this was only moments before he acted cracked the eff out. Needless to say, he forgot many a orders, confused them and then passively aggressively blame us for not getting what we ordered. Walking on eggshells the whole time because knowing that he was going through tough times, it was just awkwaarrrd.\n\nAll things considered, I should have just gotten some grub from Pine State biscuits and defrosted an eggo waffle or something. Jesus.","724":"Excellent for the summer heat.  Fresh sliced fruit atop a freezing cold acai-ice smoothie thing.  The owners are great and friendly.   Even the small is more of a meal than a dessert, though you could split one for the latter.   Expect to spend $8-10 each.","725":"Can't bring cake even for birthdays it's not like we're not eating & drinking their food. I've never heard such a thing, charge $2 per head, it's retarded! We splurge & we are very generous when we tip. It's called a gesture if they're smart they would know what it means!\nIt was nice they gave us wine tasting, I give them that! The food was good & the waitress was accommodating, patient & helpful.","726":"We had food delivered on a Tuesday night.  It took over an hour and tasted really bland.  Orange chicken didn't have any orange flavor.  Beef with broccoli was mushy and flavorless.  Pork fried rice was actually pretty alright.  Crab rangoon had almost nothing stuffed inside and the wontons were too thick and hard and they didn't taste like anything at all.  \nVery disappointing :(","727":"Honestly, I don't understand the big deal.\n\nService is great, I will say. Our waiter was the best part of the meal. Bread was the second best part--hot, crusty and salty.\n\nMussels were ok--must have been a bad one in there because I was ill that night. \"Kale salad\" was not exactly kale salad...more \"salad that includes kale among other lettuces\". Flavor was good, but just was not what I was expecting. So much of the experience is based upon expectation. If it will be a mixed lettuce salad, just let me know up front.\n\nI'll be back because it is a hub for business, but never for a special occasion.","728":"Took my husband and his comment \"why did they have a 3 1\/2, this is a 5!\". He enjoyed the sweet tea, his eggs, grits, and the Sweet Cinnamon Bun!!! (Better get there early, Buns run out) I guess whoever rated it lower isn't really from the South?","729":"Good was good but the service wasn't. They had one girl working the mid afternoon shift and I felt bad for her. They need to work on a better schedule for the customers.","730":"This place had decent reviews so decided to try it out .  Cute interior and close to Disney Springs area.  You walk up and order then take number to table to wait fir your food.  I was really excited to get my Cuban sandwich only to realize half way in that I didn't get a Cuban sandwich.  Apparently I was given the pork sandwich , which if I'm honest was bland.  I was able to add the garlic cilantro sauce we asked for and that helped with the flavor .  But really disappointed I didn't get what I ordered .  My son got the special chicken Milanese, he said it was good but more rice than chicken .  My husband got the ham and cheese arepa.  He said it was just ok.   Perhaps you will get luckier than us if you try.  Check your order before you dive in, for sure !!!","731":"Mint was fun random little stop on a recent trip to Portland. Where the place is located feels a little like out in the middle of nowhere. At one point I came to wonder whether Portlander's go out to drink at all - my mistake in that was missing the infamous microbrews. \nWe came in on the Saturday night, peak drinking hours, and we're able to land ourselves some private seating. The food selection is a bit small, but I was able to at least score something of the healthy\/vegetarian end: Hummus plate. My boyfriend got the cheese platter, which wasn't really a platter since there were only about 2 cheeses, one crudite, and loads of bread. \nThe cocktails had good selection but came out weak in the end. I had a gin based drink with grapefruit and rosemary and yielded no flavor at all. The atmosphere will make up for the lacking in eats\/drinks. There are two rooms to the bar, one which lets you have a more intimate time without the loudness  going on next door. \nNot bad, but I think we can certainly do better next time.","732":"My boyfriend and I came to the springs while on vacation. It cost us 13 dollars for the day...3 to park 10 to rent tubes from rock springs bar and grill.  It was crowded, but everyone was fairly nice. It was clean and really pretty. All in all it was a really enjoyable Friday afternoon.","733":"We stayed here for 3 nights in May 2012.  It was homey and comfortable.  The staff at the front desk was so nice.  The staff in the dinning room were a bid rude.  The suite was large and comfortable.  It had everything we needed.  It was easy to get to Boston, Salem and Rockport from this location.  The free parking was a treat!","734":"As a donut fanatic and someone who could easily down three or more in one sitting I was really looking forward to trying their donuts the first time I went. Unfortunately I was really disappointed. First of all they are kind of expensive for donuts and I was on the fence with just about every flavor they had available. In an attempt to be more than just a donut shop they go over the top with their ingredients, flavor choices and the amount of toppings they put on so I wound up settling for what I felt would be the least offensive. I forget what flavor I got but it had a funny aftertaste to it and I couldn't even finish it. I think it was the oil or something but I really wanted to like it and I didn't. \nSo not to be deterred I went back a second time a few months later and this time I remember I settled on a malt chocolate donut because I didn't feel like eating the tofu, vegan or flax seed ones they were selling (just kidding about the tofu and flax seed..they didn't have those). Again I was on the fence with the whole \"malt\" part of the deal but I thought I could not go wrong with chocolate. Well apparently I did because I couldn't eat that one either (again...the aftertaste was nasty). Sorry guys but I'm not going to pay 3 bucks or whatever it is for a donut that I really didn't want to begin with. I'm glad people are trying to bring unique shops into the area but I'm just not a fan of their donuts. Try offering a couple more traditional types like milk chocolate frosted, powered or plain and I may be tempted to give you one more shot.","735":"I'm on the fence about this one. On one hand the crowd is good most of the time and the prices are fair. On the other hand sometimes its too crowded or you just end up with a bad crowd. I like it though.","736":"Seriously I don't get the hype. Not to be racist but it felt like I was in Mexico in a cheap bar with really bad food and drunk people. and that's my two cents.","737":"It has been 14 years since our wedding at this quaint little Inn, and the only good thing I can say is that the location is beautiful. We managed to make it a beautiful day, despite the efforts of the owner to ruin it. \n\nFirst of all, she double booked rooms, and we were relegated to an odd room over a garage. We had the whole Inn reserved, but she managed to allow other people to book rooms that were not in our party. Remember this, because it comes up later...\n\nThe location fee included tables, chairs and linens. Everything was dirty. A dear friend cleaned everything and made them find linens without stains. Thankfully we had an evening ceremony. \n\nJill refused to set up the ceremony the way we wanted, so no one could see anything. \n\nThe ceremony ended, and it took her staff way too long to switch over to the reception. Our guests were hanging out forever while they slowly moved chairs from the driveway to the deck. 30 minutes to move 100 chairs? My guests started helping after 25 minutes or else it never would've happened. \n\nTowards the middle of the reception, I realized that Jill was apparently attending our wedding AND SHE HAD INVITED THE OTHER PEOPLE STAYING THERE. The very same people who were able to get rooms even though we had reserved the whole place. \n\nThe \"breakfast\" the next morning was mediocre at best. \n\nThankfully we only used them as a location and refused all other services for our wedding. \n\nI wonder if she still owns this place. I hope not. She was terrible","738":"Good, fast, friendly service. Tasty hot bowls of ramen. People waiting in line to eat - I take that as a sign of quality. All that Asian stuff, with Led Zeppelin and Stevie Ray Vaughn playing in the background on the radio. It was a good experience, and we hope to go again.","739":"They have a pretty basic happy hour. $5 glasses of wine and $4 well drinks. \n\nA friend and I split the salmon and fish tacos. The salmon was pretty standard. It came with something like rice which was okay. \n\nI really liked the fish tacos, mostly because there was a super yummy sauce on it. Overall it was an okay experience. Too pricey for the quality of food you get","740":"We were in the UBC area enjoying the weather so decided to stop in with the wife for a meal and see what all the buzz was about. \n\nOur server seated us on the patio which had a gorgeous 270 degree view of the water and mountains but I believe they have a bar, lounge and dining area as well. Couldn't beat a cheap glass of house wine with the sun full out on a Saturday afternoon. \n\nMy wife ordered the Potato & Corn soup and I ordered the Scallop Waldorf salad as my starter. I usually don't like waldorf salads as the mix of sweet and savory usually isn't my cup of tea but this dish was really well balanced substituting scallops instead of chicken which was a nice, light starter. The soup however was out of this world and was served table side with the broth being poured separately (I'm a sucker for that) over a medley of fresh corn and what looked to be fried onions. The broth was rich without being heavy and the onions provided a nice contrast in texture and flavor. That's definitely something I'll be having again. \n\nFor mains, the missus had the pan roasted trout with leeks and potatoes while I had the smoked duck leg with lentils and pickled radishes. \n\nOf the fish that my wife was willing to share with me, it was moist with a really nice creamy mustardy kind of sauce that complimented all the veg and potatoes. It gave me a bit of a German vibe and was just a great all around dish. Luckily the portion was so large she couldn't finish and I ended up having a bit more at the end. \n\nAs for my entree, the duck was AMAZING! and honestly a steal at $18?!? There really aren't many places you can get a meat entree for under $20 bucks these days and you get a full thigh and leg portion here. It was smokey and tender and crispy and had a separate jus\/gravy which you could pour over the meal (again nice to be able to control that aspect of the meal as some like it drenched in sauce while I like it portioned out) and mix with the lentils. The radishes were nice and sharp and sour which provided a nice balance to the rich duck meat. \n\nDespite being close to stuffed, we decided to gamble on dessert as well and we were not disappointed. We ordered a chocolate earl grey cake and lemon meringue pie expecting your run of the mill slice of each but what came out looked like a work of art. Both came deconstructed with different components but when eaten together came together to create a delicious flavour profile. \n\nThe chocolate cake had a moist chocolate cake base with a creamy panna cotta, early grey jelly and the most delicious orange sorbet that I've ever had in my life. The missus remarked that it was like eating 'pure orange' melting in your mouth. I'm not normally a fan of the chocolate\/orange combination but this changed all that. This is honestly up there compared to any dessert that I've had in any restaurant in Vancouver, no lie. \n\nAs for the lemon meringue pie, it came out with two kinds of meringue (dehydrated and charred), blueberries, lemon curd, thin cookies for the crust, lemon\/lime sorbet which all honestly looked like a painting. I was a little worried as sometimes these types of desserts look better than they taste but honestly all the different components again only enhanced the experience.\n\nAll in all, it was a fantastic meal with really great service throughout. It felt like fancy restaurant with the decor, the service and the presentation of the food but it was still extremely affordable with the price range closer to an earl's\/cactus club type level. I'd come back here for special occasions, dinner or even just a coffee and dessert to watch the sunset. \n\nI'll definitely be back and look forward to what they come up with from season to season.","741":"Professional?  They are anything but.   The previous reviews pretty much cover it all, DO NOT waste your time.","742":"I've tried Titaya's multiple times because I wanted to love it, many people do. But I was never really satisfied. The lighting in the restaurant is a bit harsh & the booths are just wooden & pretty uncomfortable. The food is so so, nothing amazing, the service is really good however. I still am a madam Mams kind of gal & coat & Thai trailer is up there with my for sure favorites.","743":"Great find!  They accommodated our big group and we enjoyed some of the best pizza. Not your basic toppings and now I have to figure out how to make the cauliflower pizza. Our waitress was amazing and was a promoter for the city and gave us a list of places to go.","744":"First, this park is awesome and beautiful and quiet and a lovely place to go running. I can't have a dog because I'm not at home enough, so this is a great place for me to catch up on much-needed canine time.\n\nSecondly, for all those out of-town twits: There's \"discrimination\" against other people because Cambridge residents pay for the upkeep of the park in many ways - utilities bills, municipal taxes, property taxes (higher than other places because rent\/house prices are more expensive here because of the better facilities, like Fresh Pond), car registration, parking permits, and dog licenses. I don't understand how this is complicated - we contribute our hard-earned money to keep the park lush, safe, peaceful, clean, comfortable, and poop-free - so we get preferential treatment. The out-of-towners saving money on their rent and taxes are basically expecting generous public services without paying anything.\n\nThirdly, this is a reservoir - that's the water I drink, cook with, bathe in. So there better be a fence around the water. And yeah, because I also pay for this water, I'm happy if there's incentives to limit the number of people and dogs near my drinking water supply. If there's any complaints, how about this - on the hottest day of the year, after a nice long run through the mud, I and my family and my unwashed doggy friends go and take a little swim in the Watertown\/Somerville\/South Boston Reservoir?","745":"Came here with a Groupon. Even though the website nor Groupon said so, the owner informed us that the dishes don't come with naan when using the Groupon. Sounds a bit fishy.\n\nWe got the garlic naan, palak paneer, and the Kadai chicken. The garlic naan was alright. Was basically normal naan with minced garlic on top. Needed some garlic butter brushed on it. The palak paneer was flavorless. Basically pur\u00e9ed spinach with small pieces of cheese. No real spices added it seems. The Kadai chicken was good, but there weren't many pieces of chicken in it. Unfortunately it was no better than a store bought sauce. The rice was normal.\n\nI was hopeful for this place as I want restaurants to succeed. But there isn't anything to get me to come back unfortunately. The menu is overpriced as well, even factoring in the free rice and naan.","746":"Nah. Never no more. \n\nOrdered for the first time today because I was craving hot dogs, and they popped up on the GrubHub search as delivering to my work in Cambridge.\n\nThese nuts can't follow directions. How hard is it to cut something in half? To put condiments ON the food, instead of giving me PACKETS inside the bag? Wth? I asked for cheese on the hot dogs, WHERE the heck is it? \n\nMaybe this works for the NU kids, but I'm a grown-up. Thanks.\n\nI am SO angry about this that I'm not even going to bother to call. Now, that's mad.","747":"Now accepting credit cards!  Awesome sandwich spot with a good vibe.  Had the pulled pork and it was fantastic.","748":"Ordered Greek salad yesterday. It was awful! Dedham House of Pizza does not practicing proper hygiene and food safety techniques. Green lettuce turned to brown. Rotten tomatoes, looked like a week old. Had to return salad. Will never stop at this place ever. View my posted pictures.","749":"This place was a joke compared to the escape places we have been. It was disorganized. We were able to open and get clues out of order. The young girl working there was disengaged and just basically gave us answers.  We were the last group so all she cared about was closing and leaving... she didn't offer picture we had to ask. I highly recommend that you go to any other escape room in the area over this place.","750":"In Boston visiting and we were looking for something on the north end stumbled on Locale and we were really impressed!  The service was fantastic and the pizza was some of the best I have ever had.   ordered the Brussel sprout pizza and the tartufo everything was wonderful and I don't even like Brussel sprouts.","751":"This little spot used to be owned by my partner's great aunt and uncle, when they were still around. Back then it used to be just a simple market. Things have since changed, and now this is a brewery and \"family\" restaurant. Whatever the hell thats supposed to mean. They have an assortment of beers, but even at happy hour (2-5) it was 5.25 a pint. Try the Bombay IPA- flat, but guaranteed to get you shnuckered if you have more than a couple. Maybe the local brews weren't on happy hour at all for that price. Try the Heart Attack Burger (house ground 50% bacon and 50% chuck- $12) or the Big Gyro (50% lamb, 50% beef) but upgrade your side. They serve everything with Tim's chips that look like they fell out of the bottom of the bag. Stale, too! No bueno!","752":"We were surprised at how disappointing the sushi was given the relatively positive Yelp reviews. 2 of us came here for dinner on a Saturday evening. We ordered the Montreal tuna to start which was the only bright spot in our dinner. The rolls were tasty but the tempura inside was somewhat firm and chewy giving them an odd texture. They were passable however and would have given a 3 star rating had we stopped there. The sashimi on the other hand was not up to our standards - the salmon and tuna were delicious but the mackerel and another white fish were thick and firm and tasted bad. We didn't finish the sashimi which I've never done before.","753":"Our favorite place to bring friends and family when they visit Atlanta. Dined again over the weekend and thought why have I not rated them yet. So here it is a 5 star rating for a 5 star pizza joint. Food\/Service\/Ambiance all 5 star. Keep it up !!","754":"This is tough because I really, really wanted to love this place.  Been wanting to try it since it opened, but I live over an hour a way so it took us until yesterday to finally get down there.  Paul seems like a great guy (based on the TV show and what I've heard otherwise) and I'm pulling for him to be successful, but in my opinion, if he expands now, this place will get stomped by 5 Guys, Smashburger, UBurger and other such places. \n\nFor starters we went there on a Saturday and got there around 2.  There was a long line and we were told it would be a 2 1\/2 wait (my wife reserved a table for 4 and said we'd need a high chair).  The wait was not a problem for us as we were planning to have dinner there.  After killing time kicking around Hingham, I received a text from them a little after 4:30 saying our table was ready.  We went inside and were told to wait a bit longer while they prepared our table.  Waiting was not easy as we have a 2 year old who was pretty restless and the restaurant was packed (there's not a lot of seating and were plenty of people waiting inside, spilling into the tiny dining area).  Not too long after we got in, they told a guy with his wife and infant son that the high table with the tall chairs was available for them.  Needless to say he was pretty ticked by this as he, like us, had requested a high chair.  It clearly wouldn't fit at the high table and was he expected to hold his son while he ate dinner? According to him, the hostess basically told him \"take it or leave it.\"  As you'd imagine, he got the manager and let him have it.  I'll say this, the manager and what appeared to be the assistant manager handle the situation well and were extremely patient and apologetic.  Not moments after the dust up, the same hostess asked us if we wanted that table.  I was shocked.  We too had requested a high chair.  She knows this table isn't going to work for us either, why even ask??  So, I had my chat with the assistant manager and manager.  Again, super nice.  They said they had a new app they were using this weekend for the first time and it didn't have a way to denote a high chair was needed, otherwise they would not have asked us if we wanted that table.  I accept that reasoning, but only to a point.  Why did the hostess ask us while we were standing there, with a two year old, if we wanted the high table?  Come on with that.\n\nBecause we didn't take the high table, we then waited for another hour before we got seated.  A full hour with a 2 year-old in an overly crowded, cramped restaurant.  If you have kids, you can feel our pain here.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our meal, I went to the bathroom and walked by the table of the other couple with the infant.  I asked the wife it was worth the wait and she said it was.  I then asked the husband and he said \"no way.\"  He told me the food wasn't great and that his burger was basically a sloppy joe.  I didn't know what he meant by that, but I soon found out...\n\nAs for the meal, I was surprised by two things right away.  First, the menu was small and lacked variety.  Second, they didn't have appetizers.  Then it hit me, it's just a burger joint.  I think I came in with higher expectations.  On TV it seems like a Red Robin.  Bar, full menu, plenty of seats.  Aside from the bar, if you are going here for the first time, think fast food (or not so fast) food.\n\nMy wife and I ordered the OFD burger (I don't recall exactly what was on it and it's not on their website menu for reference).  I do know it was supposed to come with a special sauce.  My wife asked for hers on the side...we'll get back to this in a minute.  We also ordered the sweet potato tots, french fries, and I got Alma's pasta salad.\n\nOur burgers arrived and when I grabbed mine to pick it up, half of my burger slide out and fell on my plate. Apparently it had been sliced in half.  My wife's, well, hers was all chopped up (ah, the sloppy joe comment makes sense now!).  It was literally in pieces!  \n\nSo aside from that weirdness, how did they taste?  Mine was dry and tastewise, I give it a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  It wasn't until I was nearly done with my burger that I realized they didn't put the sauce on it.  They did provide it on the side for my wife's so I used some of hers.  The sauce wasn't spectacular (some sauces really make the burger), but it did taste better with the sauce.  My wife said her burger was also so so with regards to taste and that it too was dry.  She did say the bun tasted good.  I didn't even notice that myself.  \n\nThe sweet potato tots were great at first, but the more I ate them, the less I liked them.  Not sure why that is.\n\nFries, nothing special at all.  I've had better fries at most other places.\n\nAlma's pasta salad was awesome.  Only issue I had with that is, they give you cheap plastic forks to eat with and you can't stab the pasta with them.\n\nWe also got milk shakes and those weren't anything to write home about either...and I'm out of characters...","755":"Had the chicken it was great and had a nice display but person I was got the swordfish and wasnt really impressed not very flavorfull.  But nice place with a great environment.  It is a little hidden and in a bad spot right next to a motel six but worth making it out.","756":"I brought my Mum here for afternoon tea, and we were very impressed. The decor of the Boston Harbor Hotel is gorgeous - so well designed, and both homey and classic.\n\nWe showed up right at the start of tea time, 2:30pm I believe, and there was already a queue. And although we checked in, they sat people that stepped up to the desk after us before us - I know I'm a snob and my expectations can be too high, but that rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nWhen they sat us - our table was covered in fresh rose petals, which was a beautiful and considerate touch. \n\nThe tea selection was delightful - I didn't even need milk or sugar to accompany the tea, it was aromatic and tasty. \n\nThe tiers of small bites were delectable and filled with a wonderful variety. Mum was pleased (and she is a really really REALLY tough woman to impress), and we felt very posh. \n\nWould absolutely bring a friend from out of town here, or a special person for a special occasion. Taking just one star off because for the price, I feel like we should have been catered to just a little bit more (but again, I recognize that I'm a bit of a prig.","757":"Worst customer service!  This used to be the only airline I'd fly.  Never again.  I  had to get my credit card company involved because they have zero common sense.  Alaska sent me an email a few days prior to me booking a flight, because they track your research on their page.  The \"you forgot something \" email had a book now link in it.  When I followed the link it was prefilled with my desired departure and return cities and my desired dates.  A couple days later, I made the purchase on the app instead on my phone.  3 days later, I get another marketing email from Alaska that encourages adding a hotel or car etc.  This is when I noticed the return date on my reservation was wrong.  It was one week shorter of a trip. They refused to adjust the return date even though it was an obvious error because the small calendar on the app selected the number that is directly above my desired date.  I didn't  notice the error  until after the 24 hour period.  There is proof from their emails to me, they know from my 10 prior visits over the last couple months, what my search dates have been.  They remained the same during each search.  Because of the saver rates they implemented like 3 days prior  to my purchase they were totally unreasonable and shockingly cold.   The FTC specifically  says you have the right to dispute wrong dates.  They are my next point of contact if Alaska refused my credit card company's request for a charge back refund.  Now they've  lost this fare and two loyal customers.  Funny, I always thought customer service was their primary focus. Disappointing to say the least.\n\nAlso, New \"Saver\" Rate was the same Main Cabin rate  a few days prior.  So instead of lowering the rate , they just slapped a bunch of restrictions and crappy seating onto the existing rate and increased the main cabin rate....during Black Friday weekend no less!  You aren't saving anything.  Pound foolish and penny wise never served a company well.","758":"The staff was extremely nice and amazing I'm giving three stars because I went in for the teeth whitening special and was informed \"you might feel some sensitivity but only on your teeth\" that wasn't bad I could handle that. However, the protective layer on the bottom of my gums wasn't on fully and my gums got burnt. The dental technician did the bottom layer and you could tell it was her first time. I'm very upset because I spent a couple hundred dollars just to get my gums burnt and only go through one session, there are three in total and I could've done them all if my gums didn't burn. I'm very upset because I feel like I wasted money and couldn't finish my sessions for something that wasn't even my fault. Amazing staff but not a good experience. They didn't even offer anything like come back to finish my other two sessions. I left very upset. I even bought the take home kit and spent more money and all I was told was \"well those will make it whiter eventually\".","759":"Masala Fart - that is the more suitable name for this place considering the pathetic service they  provide.\n\nI walked in at least an hour before the lunch buffet's closing time ,the already limited spread was almost empty and there was no one replenishing the empty food for almost 20 minutes.\n\nThe only difference between the weekend buffet (of 16$) and the daily lunch buffet (of 14$) as per their website is vegetarian crepes and Live Chana Bhathura. There was no live chana bhathura  counter and you have to give multiple reminders to the waiters for the veg crepes ,I left it it after 2 reminders. Clearing used plates and getting a second serving of the naans too took ages.\n\nSadly the food (whatever we managed to get) was delicious, so my sympathies with the cooking staff for being stuck with an incompetent management.","760":"Got the scallops and they were not good... very oily and bland. Also got a kale Caesar and it was overdressed. Based on other reviews, I'm thinking I ordered wrong. The ambiance was nice and the staff was very friendly. My 3 stars is solely reviewing the food.","761":"Excellent food and service! We had mushroom bread pudding for the first time, and I'm sure we are now ruined for others- it was amazing! We also enjoyed the steak Diane, which was not only delicious but prepared by a humorously skilled lady. Daniel D was so attentive, and even the host swung by a few times. Well worth it- we will definitely be returning!","762":"I think this place is cool.  It makes for a cool venue, and when it is packed it is like being at a much bigger show.  I always go here to see my boys Welcome to Florida and it is always fun, but they have all different acts and they have not disappointed yet.  The location is great since there are cool other bars right around the way.  Plus a liquor store so if you are on a budget you can do a little back alley pregame.  (not that I ever have or anything)  the covers are cheap but the drinks are about average for Boston.  Cool bar tenders, and generally cool clientele.  Good times check it out.","763":"Every part of our meal was amazing. We started with crusty bread and maple butter- so good! We then got Lobster tacos. They were delicious. If I could offer just one piece of constructive criticism, it would be that I wish it was a corn tortilla instead of flour. But otherwise they were perfect. So much flavor! For entrees, my husband got the hanger steak and I got the sea bass special. Both entrees were so good. And to top it off, the service was great. Our server Lindsey was so friendly and so helpful. I would highly recommend the Blue Ox!","764":"My brother and I went to Duffy's for lunch. The service was good and the food was ok. However this is one of the most overpriced restaurants for the quality of food you get I have ever seen. They charged top dollar for a very small portion of food. We left here $45.00 poorer and was still hungry. We will not go back here. If your looking for value for your money go elsewhere.","765":"I just want to dispel one myth....\nTreadwells is NOT homemade ice cream.\nThey actually use Puritan Ice cream out of Roslindale Massachusetts.\nDecide for yourself on the quality\nPersonally?....I prefer Giffords, Shains of Maine or Richardson's.......in that order","766":"I love this Cartier. From the first time I stepped into this store, I felt very welcomed. They go out of their way to greet you and help you. Jeanette has helped me out and I purchase my ring from her. It was a very great experience and everyone there is very knowledgeable and gives you advice and input. They also educate you on diamonds and I find that to be a big plus since I did not know anything about that before!! You will not be disappointed.","767":"Oh my, I really dislike writing unsavory reviews, but my experience here was just not great at all. I'll spare you the details and just say that all was subpar about my visit. I liked the homey feel of the place and maybe folks were just having a bad day but I probably won't be back anytime soon. I'd be happy to support a local and long-running breakfast spot if food and service aren't lacking.","768":"I originally found this location through the insider on Facebook. They featured the homemade choco tacos and I knew immediately I needed to go there. I went on my birthday after eating at high noon( amazing!). I loved the fact that it's inside as it was cold out that night. It's located inside a indoor food cart\/market place. The selection of ice cream would not what you would call \"original\" which can usually be quite the treat. This time it fell flat for me. I, of course, got a ice cream taco. I found the chocolate shell too rich\/bitter and wasn't expecting the filling to be spiced with cinnamon\/chile. Service was fast and friendly and I'm sure the ice cream by itself is good. I think I just made the wrong choice for my personal taste.","769":"The saus is really saucy! If you like good fries and\/or poutine this place is for you! Fries are super good and the 10+ options for sauces are even better!","770":"Lackluster job. Suspect attention to detail. I had to bring things to my barbers' attention and even still the experience wasn't great.","771":"A very small and quaint cafe which you can easily walk by if you are not paying attention but that you should not as it will never disappoint and will always leave you feeling happy physically with delicious, inexpensive and interesting food as well as emotionally for it's cute Japanese-style etiquette and decor along with friendly, fast and gregarious service.  Serving both Western style (think eggs Benny, sandwiches, etc.) and Japanese-inspired food (miso, rice balls, ome-rice, noodles), this cafe has it all. You will be pleasantly surprised at the variety of items offered (even an eclectic array of desserts, teas, smoothies, bakery items, etc.) and at the very affordable price which is a real treat especially given the location that usually lacks affordable venues for nutritious and affordable restaurants.","772":"This place is weird. It was pretty empty with BLARING music on the Saturday night I was there, and the few people who were getting their groove on upstairs were completely blasted. One girl actually fell over a couple times, and used my boyfriend's leg to pull herself off the floor. CLASSY LADY.\n\nDrink prices were typical Faneuil Hall, but drinks must have been strong if the clientele is any exception. I might have considered giving The Point a second chance, if not for one tiny detail: The owner's daughter was featured on an episode of \"My Super Sweet Sixteen,\" and you can bet that spoiled little bitch isn't going to benefit from my $5 cover ever again.","773":"The best $12 you will ever spend in and around Boston. Boris , our guide, was funny , informative and gave us the sense of what it's like to be a Harvard student. I highly recommend this tour over walking aimlessly.","774":"This was an interesting place. First off, the address is 4001 Parmer Rd, yet it sits way back off the street (behind a strip mall and a pharmacy). The place is very big and spacious with very high ceilings. I can't believe that this was built as is for the current restaurant so I wonder what was there before. In the bar area, a huge screen showing 3 different shows, ESPN, some other game and Music videos. In between the bar and the restaurant sits a large cigar bar where evidently you can smoke (something you can't do in California).\n\nThe upside - \nThe food was very good. The special was a NY Strip with Blue Cheese over garlic mashed potatoes. The potatoes were right on, you could taste the garlic but it wasn't over powering. The steak was cooked perfectly. Too many times I get a medium steak coming out looking like it had just come out of the butcher shop. Dessert was a Maker's Mark Whiskey Bread pudding which as pretty good (better than average, but I have had better). Service - some of the best. The crew that took care of us reminded me of the service you get at Carvers in Rancho Bernardo - top notch all the way. This would certainly qualify for the 4 stars range\n\nDownside - price. One Beer, dinner and dessert was over $70 (tip was included since there was a large group of us). The beers were $7.95 for a pint which is a bit much, especially considering the selection. Take a 1\/2 point deduction right there. 1\/4 point deduction comes from the combination of the noise factor (the high ceilings just seemed to create an echo) and the chairs were not that comfortable. Since I can't give it anything other than 3 or 4, I am left with giving it just the 3 stars.\n\nThat said - I would certainly go back if I get back to Austin.","775":"Landed in Orlando for a week for work.  Stopped in for a late dinner.  Ordered the JUMBO seared scallop with carrot puree.  The 4 scallops sat lonely on top of what looks like baby food with green peas and bacon bits mixed in, topped with green oil.  As the dish indicated on the menu as Jumbo, the quarter size scallops were far from jumbo.  The mush of carrots and peas and bacon bits mixed with diced turnip was sweet and salty without any performance or taste.  The actual scallop itself was soaked in salt as well.  I told the waiter and he says, yeah that is one of the dish he would not recommend....then why have it on the bloody menu?   Needless to say, if you like to have over priced nasty baby food, go ahead and order this for $24.99.  The upside was the caesar side salad was good. \n\nService was good.  Not worth coming back for okay service.","776":"I arrived at Mr. Tire before 8:00 AM with a nail in my driver's-side rear tire.  I made this clear to the fellow at the front desk.  \"Driver's-side rear tire.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, my car is up on a lift.  One of the technicians enters the  waiting room and asks me where exactly the puncture is, because they can't find one on the passenger's-side rear.  Okay.  A miscommunication.  Good Morning America is on, and I'll have time to make it to work by nine.  Right?\n\nAn entire HOUR goes by until the technician pulls my car out of the garage.  We're deep into LIVE with Kelly and Ryan.  The technician pulls away with my car (a Mustang) and low-key gooses it down Dunwoody Village Parkway and around the block.  I've had plenty of punctures repaired in the past, and not one of them required an unauthorized joyride to clear the TPMS code, or whatever.  Nor did they take a whole hour to complete from the time my car was pulled into the garage.  Or an hour and a half from the time I arrived.","777":"Today I had an amazing Aromatherapy massage with Jane. I made an appt. to use a gift certificate I received a few years ago. I can't say enough good things about Jane. Although I don't live close by I definitely plan on returning for another appointment. I haven't felt this relaxed in years. Carlene was wonderful and she and Nicholas helped with a small problem redeeming the GC. I can't thank you enough. I've read good and bad reviews of this spa, but I can say 100% that my experience was a 10.","778":"I am a fan! I do love donuts and I loved the variety that blue star had. i wish the location was easier to park and the inside had more seating room. But all in all, if you are looking for a delicious on-the-go donut this is your place!","779":"I'm not 100% sure how I feel about axe throwing as a leisure activity. There's an element of safety along with an element of unfamiliarity with hatchet handling that seems like a recipe for calamity to me. And to be fair, the instructors and coaches at the facility put safety and awareness at the forefront. They go to the furthest extent to instruct safety first. But what they don't know is that John in lane 6 had 3 shots of tequila and a bump of blow before tossing. Then John takes his axe and tosses it in the wrong direction and then Friday the 13th poor Sammy in lane 5. So because of my own trepidation, I can't really say I had the best time. But here are some takeaways from my visit:\n\n- you can BYOB and food too\n- great for large groups and parties\n- plenty of lanes\n- good instructors\n- parking can scarce on peak days\n- we paid about $35 for an hour of hatchet hurling\n\nOverall I say 3-stars. I'm just too nervous to ever do it again. But Bad Axe can be a good time for the most part.","780":"Very friendly place! The only thing is that the cooks look unclean. Great service nice chill spot overall ok but not 5star","781":"Not the most authentic or delicious Mexican food I've ever had, but a good option downtown. My special enchiladas verdes plate was quite good, and service was speedy. Nice decor (southwest-y but not too tacky) and not too loud. They have burritos, tacos, and nachos also. This is more of a burrito assembly line place (like Anna's) than an authentic Mexican experience, but, again, no complaints when they have cheap Mexican food downtown. I'll be back.","782":"I'd give them a zero if I could. My package was originally shipped on June 8, it's now June 23 and the tracking info hasn't been updated in 12 days. On June 11 it arrived in Bloomington CA and has been sitting there since. It's terrible how such an expensive company like Good American uses the worst shipping service out there. Will never order from them again bc it takes over a month to receive the product.","783":"my last meal here was so gross it made my friend sick just watching me eat it (i'm not kidding).  i've been dragged here a handful of times, every time i forget to leave my picture (in case they want to see me again).  ugh!  wtf why this place so popular?","784":"**BEWARE** Before you spend your money here, please know one thing: they do not stand behind their products! After the untold amount of money I have spent at this shop, things got shady quick when they sold me a defective product. I needed a new battery, so I drove out of my way to go to my favorite vape shop, cool. The manager and owner were both there, and I took my time finding the right apparatus to suit my needs, cool. As soon as I got home, I assembled the piece (i.e. filled the tank, screwed in coil); it wouldn't turn on. I thought maybe it needed to charge, so I plugged it in, but after 6 hours it still wouldn't work. I took it back today and the same manager that sold it to me told me that, \"about half of the shipment didn't work.\" wanting reliability, I asked to trade up to a better constructed model and I was told no. Because I, \"used half of it\" meaning I simply filled the tank, I couldn't trade up, I couldn't get my money back, and all they would give me is $30 in-store credit or another one of their shoddy products that has a 50% chance of working, not cool. I will NEVER spend another dime in this store, as there is plenty of competition out there and shops that will stand by their loyal customers.","785":"I hired CJL Management to manage my property when my job moved me to Texas in October 2014.  I had previously not rented my property out to tenants and Carleen was a perfect match for this \"first timer\".  She is knowledgeable about everything from leasing contracts to who to hire for odd jobs around the house.  I can call\/text her for anything and she is quick to respond.  I have been both pleased with her professionalism and impressed by her commitment to manage my property as if it is her own.  She comes highly recommended!","786":"Finally the first Starbucks I have found in Texas that has the same customer service and as fast as the ones back in Seattle. I love green tea frappuccino WITHOUT the whip and for some reason since I've left my hometown no Starbucks has made this order right. But this one did so that just made my day!!","787":"Amazing quality for donuts. The price is a little steep but its worth it. Voodoo is all hype but the quality is meh. \n\nRemember that not all people who eat donuts are fat, but all fat people eat donuts...","788":"Stopped in for lunch. For 31.00, I expected a bit more. The Rueben was on small square bread, had little meat, and honestly, was thoroughly underwhelming. The bbq pulled pork was a bit better perhaps in size at least, but still no wow factor for sure. I'm no cheapskate, but I felt pretty ripped off for what was served.","789":"We are 6:30 am regulars and love OTF! The trainers always challenge you and I love that the workout is different every day. I've seen huge improvements in my speed and strength since coming to OTF. If you are looking for a fun, challenging workout definitely come try it out! Your first session is free!","790":"The first time, the technician showed up without any of the replacement parts even though the company was given serial and model numbers so that there would not have to be a second appointment.\nThe second time, the technician accused me of making the adjustments that he had made that caused additional problems. I had not touched any of the controls.\n My freezer is now at 10 degrees and the refrigerator at 28 degrees! Time to call someone else.","791":"First time for us and we both found it underwhelming. Starting with a beer that should've been colder to a cocktail that was mostly ice, and moving though a nothing special app of fried green tomatoes, to a sad succotash, tasteless but for an abundance of what tasted like Liquid Smoke, to the one thing that was good, fried chicken. Even the sides, green beans and corn bread, should have been better. Ending on the positive, our server was very friendly.","792":"Not the worst, but, definitely not the best.  They very rarely have what I need, the deli is rarely open when I go, and when it is, the workers ignore me and what little bit of food they have is dried up.  Yuck!  Plus, their restrooms are filthy.  I hate having to use them.  I just hold it, if I can.  This Winn-Dixie has been in the same spot since 1958, and it shows.  Very small, dirty, leaks, cracks in many of the tiles.  I don't think any remodeling was ever done, aside from maybe a paint job 20 years ago.  \n\nThe reason I give it 2 stars instead of just one is for the friendliness and the fact that's it's never crowded.  I can be in and out, without having to wait in a line.","793":"Finding a good pizza place is the single most important task ahead of you in a new apartment, and i dearly wanted College Pizza to be it.  More so after finding that they had a flag of a Turkish soccer team hanging, which is cool and obscure (the owner is a Fenerbah\u00e7e fan).  Unfortunately, the pizza is mediocre, the toppings are insufficient and of poor quality, and the overall result is predictably weak.  The only good news is that it's pretty cheap for pizza.  So the search continues.","794":"My friends held their wedding reception at The Foundry and it proved to be an excellent venue for their 120-person guest list.\n\nThe food was top-notch, with a tasty buffet of flank steak and salmon and excellent sides. The servers were attentive, pleasant and blended into the background. The central dance floor allowed most of the guests to see the first dance and the large outdoor porch provided a breath of fresh air and good views of the Willamette River.\n\nThe bride's room is downstairs and provided her (and the groom too) with lots of space to relax and get ready before the festivities began. There is also a pier extending into the Willamette open to guests.\n\nThe few drawbacks to the venue are: The stairs to the top level hall reveal a bit too much to the people in the lower lobby for anyone wearing a dress. The four, large columns block some views of the dance floor. The only decent wall for projecting a slide show cannot be seen by all guests at once.","795":"There is only one thing I don't like about this place. Too many know how good it is. So it's likely to be crowded. Not always but usually. Beyond that this meat market butcher shop is the best I know in Portland. Always friendy service. Finest quality. Made or cut to order. True old school. Sure you hate to wait but in this case it's worth it.","796":"$10 YOGA. $10 YOGA. $10 YOGA.\n\nIt's a deal. And it'll only last til the end of 2015 as they're closing up shop. Find the daily schedule on their facebook (here: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YogaConAmor).  I sincerely hope that they go out with as many full classes as possible.","797":"This pizza from Austin is by far the best frozen pizza ever. Crust is superb. It passed My husband Billy Howard 's critical palate. I would totally serve that at a party! Can't wait to check out the other 4 flavors.","798":"Overpriced, small plates, mediocre food, crowded, loud. The home fries were spiced with cyan pepper. Well, that's not indicated on the menu. Home fries don't usually come spiced with cyan pepper. Plus, even if you like cyan pepper, they came way to spicy. I felt like I was having breakfast in a college dorm. Not a place for a family with kids.","799":"Uhhh..... what is wrong with JetBlue and this airport? There's a huge long line just for bag drop and a 25 minute wait for security. At their JFK terminal there were no lines. Visiting Orlando was nice but everything about this airport from arrival to departure was an unacceptably disappointing mess.","800":"Drank here in college years ago. Was known as a popular Southie hangout. The occasional fight. The occasional Bruin dropping in. \nNow? I wouldn't eat there but would return for some nostalgic drinks!!!!","801":"This place has a great atmosphere. The prices are a bit high, it is downtown Vancouver after all. The service is fine. The big BUT in this place is the owner, or partner, or whomever she is. Short Sandy hair, never cracks a smile, makes you feel like you are taking up space, even though you just brought in 10 people to the place and we are all having drinks. We all felt she was rude, so after one drink, we went elsewhere and spent our money there! \nSo, yes I will be back but if that woman is working or gives us the sour look, we will go elsewhere. Service industry, hospitality, customer service... study those terms!","802":"Went there today with a dining companion for the lunch buffet. Admittedly we arrived towards the later end of the buffet. Still we were surprised to see the bill on our table before we had even sat down to take a bite. They apologized and said they were not trying to hurry us. \nThis was a lie. Our service was poor and shorty after we had started eating we were told that they were getting ready to close, and for us to please make our final trip to the buffet to acquire whatever we wanted to finish our meal. Not that there were that many options to choose from on the mostly empty buffet station but  we acquiesced and finished our meal to the sound of the restaurant staff tearing down the buffet and cleaning the restaurant. Our bill was returned a short ten minutes after is was removed. \nNever before had I felt under such pressure to leave a place that I clearly was not wanted in. We finished our food amid the noise and clatter of the workers, left a minimum tip and made a hasty exit.\nThis in one place I will avoid at all costs in the future and urge others to do so as well. Stay away from this place. They have a lot to learn about customer service.","803":"I received a call at the time that my appointment was supposed to start, saying she was stuck in traffic and would be 20 minutes late. 50 minutes later she finally showed up.\n\nOn 3 occasions she asked me if I has things that she could use to help her clean. Isn't that her job, to bring these things??\n\nI was supposed to have a 2 hour cleaning and after 1.5 hours she said she was finished. And overall the job was underwhelming. As in, she didn't do anything that I couldn't do. My whole reason for hiring a cleaner was so that someone would clean things that I wouldn't think to clean! There was no vacuuming done. Just a dry sweep and then a semi-wet 'mop.' And after she left, I vacuumed the entire place myself because the floors still weren't clean. \n\nNext time I hire a cleaner, I'll try a different company.","804":"We came here after a show at the Ohio Theater. It was an easy walk. The food here was excellent. I had the spring chefs tasting menu and my husband ordered a few things off the menu. The beef tartare, goat cheese croquette and spinach gnocchi were among my favorites. The tasting menu came with duck and it was fabulous. My husband had the tomahawk pork chop which was very good (not my favorite in the city though). The waitress was excellent as well. My only \"complaint\" was how big the tasting menu portions were.  The waitress joked that they had been working with the chef to reduce the portion sizes and I agree. I basically could only have a bite of the dessert.","805":"Fantastic idea. It's my go-to when pulling my own lettuce and veggies out of the crisper is much too much to deal with. I would like to see a little more variety in the menu, but I'm pretty happy with the homegrown healthy fast food joint, and I never tire of fresh Cobb Salad.","806":"We had a great birthday party thanks to Tiny Tails!  The whole process was very organized and the kids all had a fantastic time holding all the animals.  If you have an animal over I'm sure they would love this party!!","807":"Expect to lose money and time.\n\nThis is the only laundry available to many people in the neighborhood. Most of the machines (washers, dryers, and coin machine) are broken frequently. Every time I am there, I see at least one person waste money and soap on a broken washer. I have lost 4 loads in the past 2 days. There is NO way to contact the owners of the business. No number, name, or address. Customers leave notes stuck to the walls and washers asking for repair or refund. Usually the signs are removed within 24 hours, but the machines are still broken. On any given day, at least 3 washers are broken with no indication. The broken washers \"rotate\" however - often one that worked previously steals money and a broken one is working again. Several customers have complained about receiving nickels from the quarter dispenser. Using this laundry is a gamble. Customers should expect to spend more than the stated price, as it is impossible to guess which machine will work.\n\nIt seems as though this business operates as a purposeful scam to take money without providing service.","808":"Classically Boston pizza, from the preposterously pretentious box (essentially, a toolish bourgeois \"mission statement\" declaring their claim to being \"quite extraordinary pizza\") to the grossly excessive price and the deficient quality.  I'll grant that they have a wide variety of options in terms of toppings, sauces, etc, and that they're good about reeling you in with coupons and such, but otherwise, it's thoroughly mediocre.  Delivery isn't particularly fast, either.","809":"What makes this place so great? I thought this place was average at best. The price is a bit high for ok food. \n\nThe wait staff is terrible, they dissapear for the longest time and show up for a few seconds. We sat upstairs and for a party of 6 we were placed in an area were you can't really move at all. There were already two tables of 6 upstairs and a smaller table. It's very crowded up there and you have to climb over your family and friends when you need to go to the restroom. \n\nSmall portions for what you feel is overpriced. The minute you leave this place you'll likely be hungry again for something else.","810":"This is a combined review of ordering deliver from this restaurant using Grub Hub-\n\n2hrs and 15 minutes after placing a simple order of 1 entree and some bread (that indicated a 60 minute wait on the app), I finally was able to try the food.  It was good.\n\nDuring that 135 min wait for dinner, the driver misinformed me with a false eta, a grub hub support rep lied to me about getting a 2nd discount, and when delivering the driver didn't apologize for the delay.\u00a0 He only said \"here's your food\" and then turned away and left.\n\nI understand delays happen in your industry, but a $10 credit from Grub Hub isn't enough to risk using the service for ordering from this restaurant.\n\n$10 app credit on a order I tipped $8 for.\n\nThanks, but no thanks.\n\nNever again!","811":"I ordered sun kiss ($8.95) but the rice was stale. The avocado, imitation crab and mango was okay but the mango sauce was really artificially flavoured. There were 3 sushi chefs but we had to wait about 15 minutes for our order, the place wasn't busy. Average sushi, customer service was okay. Probably won't come again.","812":"Horrible!! Awful!! Go someplace else!!! I would give ZERO stars if i could. We tried this place when it first opened and it wasn't great, but figured we'd give it another try.  I ordered something as simple as a cheeseburger sub....i think the burgers were made three days before they made the sub!! So rubbery and tough that an alligator couldn't chew it!! There are PLENTY of good sub\/pizza shops in Lynn. I hope this one doesn't last long!!!","813":"Prices do seem a bit stiff for what you get.  I agree with some reviewers that the pizza is a bit greasy.  They seem to get a fair amount of business from the bargoers next door at Woodrow's because they don't serve their own food.\n\nSometimes the pie is good and sometimes not.  They do use quality ingredients it seems, but the execution is inconsistent which is disappointing because there is definitely potential here.  I work down the street so I would definitely support them again, but without grand expectations.","814":"Same pluses and minuses as others mentioned.  Great sales rack, unhelpful staff.  All but ignored me until I approached the registers (I could jump to a host of conclusions here, but I won't.) The clothes fit great, though.  I will probably shop online before going into the store again.","815":"I've been doing advanced research to help a friend prep for an upcoming move and Steve was great about answering questions. He replied to my email within 20 minutes, which seems unheard of these days. I appreciated that! He answered my specific questions and even offered alternatives to save me money on moving boxes. I'd be happy to use this company when the time comes.","816":"If you ever feel bad about drinking during the day, Cactus Club is most certainly the place to hang out amongst your people. Sit next to college kids just waking up and husbands\/boyfriends entangled in Newbury Street shopping bags. Good times. \n\nI feel like the drinks here are more of the girly variety than the down and durty margarita variety.. aka.. light on the alkie. They're good, but they taste more like smoothies (frozen margs). Food is so so, but I think it'd be better if I didn't feel like I was being slightly robbed. The service.. however..  can be impossible! Make sure to bring along a good friend to help you endure the wait. I mean, the waiters\/waitresses are nice enough.. just make sure you don't come here ravenous. No matter how busy or empty it is.. Cactus Club always seems to be the same amount of slowwwwww.\n\nAnd although I do love a good patio.. a patio next to a busy intersection, not so much. It's so cramped that you or your dining companion will most likely bump chairs with another table at least thrice in one sitting. AND you'll have to endure such passive aggressive moves as the loud sigh.. and the \"Man I wish there was more room\" shout.. not directed to you specifically, but meant for you to overhear. \n\nMeh.. you never really choose to go here. You just end up in front of it and mistakenly walk in. A couple times a year.","817":"Went for a Google event and got to try a couple of the drinks and several of the appetizers. The first thing I got was the mini taco variety. I didn't really like any of the 4 that were given. I also tried the quesadillas, nachos, ceviche, and queso. The queso was definitely the highlight. I've never had a queso that tasted quite like theirs. For drinks, I had the Fresco which was pretty good and the Cherry Limeade which had just a bit of that mediciny taste which I don't like. Overall, everything was decent but overpriced. It's a nice location, but either better or cheaper Mexican food can be found in Austin without too much trouble.","818":"I was impressed with everything about my room here. The size, comfort, cleanliness, amenities, decor--everything was top notch. In fact, it was everything i expect at a Westin, Hyatt Regency or Renaissance hotel (and even better than some of those I've been to).\nI'm not giving 5 stars because I did not have a chance to go to the restaurant, lounge or health club. My rating is for just the room and staff and those were absolutely terrific!","819":"Disaster upon return.  Texted our ticket number and heard driver radio it in three times.  Yet......no car.  My wife went inside where three people were just sitting around and when asked tried to blame the driver.  Poor!","820":"I'd rate this a 3.5 but, since Yelp only works in whole numbers, I'm bumping it up to a 4. And that's pretty much solely due to a damn tasty sauce that I couldn't stop eating. \n\nIt was a busy night in Chuy's last night. Although, since there was only 2 of us, we were seated right away at a small table in the dining room overlooking Whole Foods. The decor is sort of Car lovers chic, we had a velvet painting overlooking us. Our waitress was super helpful walking us through the variety of sauces and dishes. We both ordered margaritas; the hubs had a classic margarita and I had \"Grand Ma's Rockin' Rita\" which is basically a classic margarita with extra orange liqueur. I made the better choice, the rockin' rita was very tasty. The classic margarita is lime heavy and not very sweet but it is pretty good. I look forward to trying the blood orange variety another time. \n\nWhile we were deciding on what to order, our waitress came back with a dish of \"her favorite sauce\". It was the creamy jalapeno sauce. Holy crap, this stuff was tasty. They say it is a medium spiced sauce but I didn't get any heat at all... all I got was lovely, lovely flavor. You should ask for a side of this sauce and dip stuff in it. We settled on a 1\/2 order of the chile con queso for an appetizer which was pretty awesome. I had the chicka chicka boom boom enchilada and the hubs had the steak burrito for dinner. My enchilada was fabulous... it was pretty spicy last night (they make everything in-house so it can vary in heat slightly) and the burrito was HUGE and tasty. We were both stuffed to gills when we left (in addition to our meals, we plowed through 2 baskets of chips). The price is on par with an Abuelo's but not overly ridiculous for the food. $9.50 for my margarita was a bit much though. The food is solid and the sauces are great, I think they can adjust things to your needs so if you have a food issue (gluten-free, etc...) you should be able to find something here to enjoy.","821":"So I totally printed off their website's 10% coupon. Times 20. In the month of August. heh\n\nI didn't have any gear for the big Long Beach walk this summer.. so.. I pretty much made my rounds to every City Sports in the greater Boston area with that coupon a few days in August. I went to this store the most  since it's in my hood. Don't expect the kind of sports shoe knowledge that you'd get at Marathon Sports. Although, I did appreciate the appropriate amount of hovering that the salesman did when I was trying to figure out what kind of walking shoes I wanted to get. Not too pressing, he remained available while I bounced, walked, and did the Charlie Brown to make sure the shoes fit well. \n\nThe store isn't that big, but it's comparable to any big sports chain that I'm used to like Modell's or Sports Authority. I've purchased weights as well as walking\/running, tennis, swim, and basketball gear from this store. Not to mention clothing (usually on sale). The price is usually right (or right now right) and they run sales frequently. Clothes as well as shoes (they have a lot of 'buy one, get a 2nd pair half off' sales). Other stores do have a better sales section though.","822":"I've been here three times. The food and drink are very good as is the atmosphere. The service? It sucks. \n\nI was there in 2016 with a friend who has celiac disease. He must eat gluten free or it comes back to bite him seriously.  He let the waiter know and asked about GF options as they were not marked on the menu. The waiter picked some out, my friend ordered one, and figured out after eating a fourth of it that it wasn't, in fact, gluten free but had a fair amount of grain in it. They offered to not charge him for the meal only after he protested his terrible service.\n\nWas there for a going away party for work over lunch. Had a good time. No problems.  \n\nThis week I went back with some good friends for happy hour. We wanted to stay and have a good time. Had plenty of money to spend. We didn't stand out in terms of being just like any other customers. A few engineers out to talk about work. Yet after only 30 minutes our waiter cleared our table after two drinks and didn't offer us anything additional before the check arrived. No explanation. Very rude. It's too bad. The menu is pretty good. It's just that that alone isn't enough now days to be able compete with better alternative venues.","823":"The barista looked upon us with loathing as we walked in out of the rain after a cold Sunday morning ride...at least the coffees were reasonably agreeable.","824":"Typical dive bar right in the city. It was understandably pretty quiet at 2pm New Year's Day, there were a few patrons sitting at the bar when we arrived. \n\nWe ordered a couple drinks, a basket of onion rings, and two bowls of clam chowda. The clam chowda came out immediately. Unfortunately it was barely warm. There wasn't a lot of clams in it, and it was slightly runny. \n\nThe onion rings were better, they were hot and tender. We didn't expect gourmet soup, but it would have been much better if it was hot.","825":"My hubs and I very much have drank the Voodoo Doughnut koolaid but we decided to try out Blue Star Donuts on our most recent trip to PDX. We went to the Hawthorne neighborhood location and I had the buttermilk old fashioned. It was good. I am a simple donut fan - if you're not doing the classics right, you're failing. And I think both Voodoo and Blue Star are doing the classics right, even if they are known for their funkier flavors.","826":"Ok disclaimer--I do not own any metal, leather, fishnets or red lipstick. So this is not a place I would go, however, it was on my bus tour and as a true yelper I have to yelp about it, right?\n\nIf you are into any of the above things that I am not this place is effing cool as hell. It's dark, they show movies on the wall of a building next door, a grip of outside seating for those who smoke (and lots of folks were). The decor is very unique and goth and creepy, but pulled off very well. They have a stage inside for their local metal bands and that is very nice of them. \n\nAlas, this not being a \"Jenn\" place is not the reason for the two stars. No no, I do not judge or roll the way of snarky bitch. The two stars is for this...If you know that you are hosting the last ever concert of Portland Rock demi-gods, which will draw a HUGE crowd--AND--you're a stop on a bus tour with 60 lushes you better have some booze to keep the masses happy.\n\nUtilizing my Yelp ap I thought I'd see what was good here--beyond the Hamm's and PBR that were obvious choices in the hands of almost everyone. Mojito a fellow yelper suggests--ok, I can get on board with that...No mint?! Ok...how about an Alabama Slammer for our bride-to-be...no slow gin?! Ok, now i'm getting angrier than the screaming from the stage. No PBR? No Hamm's left? WTF?! Ok, fine I'll resort to my normal microbrew and get my homegirl over here a kamikaze. \n\nDid we leave because we were clearly in the wrong joint? No we left because the wrong joint ran dry.","827":"Have been here on multiple occasions and have come to the conclusion that it's rather hit or miss in terms of what dishes you order.\n\nA safe bet is always the green beans and the Xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). I've had their dan dan mian \/ dan dan noodles and it was far too peanuty, and I was left bummed out because I had really been craving a good dan dan noodle. \n\nThey have some good dishes, some not-so-good one,  but overall I would say it's rather average.","828":"This Super Walmart is located on Rinehart Road in Sanford, FL less than 1\/2 a mile from the 417. It's the large store with large seasonal offerings, outdoor\/ammo, grocery and pharmacy sections.\n\nStore is spacious, clean and well lit. Staff has been helpful when needed. Huge parking lot, which is usually full.","829":"The pizza wasn't that good. The breadsticks were ok. The only big plus for them is that they delivered late and we were hungry from getting out of a concert late and couldn't find anything else open. The delivery guy very nice.","830":"on a day trip to Vancouver we wanted to try the Pho scene in Vancouver,BC. The place was clean, quick service. The portions were good and quality was nice as well. I'd definitely consider this as a quick stop lunch spot.","831":"Very good German restaurant and wonderful Buffett! Deserts galore. Would recommend if in the area.","832":"Food is good. Food took forever to get out, although there were maybe 2-3 other parties in the building. All staff members we're standing around in the kitchen doing nothing","833":"Myself and fellow Medfordians have been waiting for this restaurant to open.  I'll be brief...decor could use some spicing up...perhaps they went on the 'inexpensive' (lots of white walls) and will decorate as business gets better and the place gets a personality.  But that's just details...the food was really good!  Bread was warm, prices were reasonable, drinks were yummy (I like the Medford slant on them).  I got the tips sampler:  steak, pork, and chicken BBQ tips with rice.  Melt-in-your-mouth good!  Seriously, meat eaters must try the tip sampler.  I had enough for a second meal!  Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.","834":"Wings are just ok. I order crispy every time and only a few on the top seem to be crispy...almost like the oil isn't hot enough when they fry the wings so they are soggy. Wings get 2 stars. But the burgers here are GOOD!! That's why overall 3 stars. Try the burgers!","835":"This is my go-to place for brunch. I always take visitors here and I never look like an idiot for suggesting this place because it is consistently great. I may have just jinxed myself by saying that, but if you want a place to take mom and dad or your best friend from college, then run, don't walk to Babette's. \n\nN.B., I've only been here for Sunday brunch, so I can't attest to their dinner menu. However, brunch is awesome. The Babette's Benedict is amazing. I'm not an eggs benedict person, but the addition of filet mignon and sun-dried tomatoes in the hollandaise makes this perfection. They have great french toast and the omelets are the best in Atlanta. I hesitate to order omelets because they are always: 1. too big and 2. overcooked. You know how a lot of places cook your omelet and it is brown? Never at Babette's. I love their goat cheese and fine herbs omelet, which has been replaced with a spinach and feta omelet. The eggs are perfect. I really have nothing negative to say about the food because from the entree to the sides, it's all perfection. Their coffee is good too.  \n\nIt's usually crowded, so either get there when they first open (10:30) or make a reservation like I do on OpenTable. \n\nI was there at the beginning of February with a group of 7 and we did have an issue with the valet. You must valet your car. The valet rear-ended my friend's car with our other friend's car and didn't want to take responsibility for it. This wasn't a case of rolling into the car in front, he hit it pretty hard. I see that another reviewer had an issue with the valet, so just beware.","836":"The worse service I've ever experience.\n\nThese guys really truly don't care about the customer at all.\n\nBrent charged me $50 to do an estimate on a new power steering pump. He gave me the estimate and when I brought it back to get the work done, he said that he threw the paperwork away and would need to redo the estimate.\n\nHe kept my car all day and never even touched it. it just sat on his lot hile I was being charge $40 per day for a rental.\n\nThis place is terrible. I wouldn't say that they are scam artists, they just don't care about the customer at all.\n\nThe other guy who works there is Robert. He's a lot more honest than Brent, but I think Brent owns the place. \n\nThe mechanics seem to be good guys. But honestly, I would definitley pay a few dollars more and take your car somewhere else.","837":"Although the location downtown is very convenient, and the setting makes for beautiful pictures, I strongly suggest you look somewhere else for your wedding\/reception.  Planning a wedding can be stressful enough, and dealing with the owner of Austin's Inn at Pearl Street will definitely drive you over the edge!\nI fell in love with the cute bed-and-breakfast the first time I saw it.  Jill Bickford, the owner, gave me a tour and a play-by-play of what an actual wedding may look like.  She sold me immediately, but I wanted my fianc to give the okay.  So, we went for a second tour, and we got the same song and dance.  Days were filling fast, so we put down the non-refundable $850 deposit soon after our second tour.\nAfter my deposit was received, things that I was told during the first 2 tours started to change.  I tried to go with the flow and not get stressed out, but dealing with Jill was not easy.  I believe she is just very flighty and unorganized - and doesn't remember what she told you from one day to the next.  When I realized this, I chose to deal mainly with her assistant, Crystal.  Crystal, thank goodness, is very organized.  She started to put everything in writing and was consistent when either my fianc or I asked her questions.  \nUnfortunately, this all fell apart the day of my wedding.  I had booked the Inn for 4 hours (for both my wedding and reception).  I had to pay $30 per guest for the venue.  This fee was to cover the use of the entire first floor of the Inn and Bride & Groom's changing rooms, along with several other things.  I was told the week before my wedding that the normal bride's changing room was already booked, and they didn't have another option.  Thankfully, my aunt had rented a room at the B-and-B, and she agreed to allow me to change there.  I was not happy, but again, I tried to go with the flow.  When I arrived a few hours before my wedding, I was told by my aunt (I was never approached by Inn staff), that the normal bathroom and the first floor of the Inn were now booked with other guests, and they were not available for my reception (they had mistakenly overbooked the Inn).  So, my aunt was forced to give up her private bathroom for all of my guests to use!  When she complained, Jill told her that there was no other option!!!  When my pastor arrived, he needed to change.  Of course, the groom's changing room was booked as well and not available for my wedding!  To top it off, several of my wedding guests (including my mother) said that Jill and her staff were rude to them throughout the evening.\nServices that were promised to me and that I paid for were not available on the day of the event.  I was never informed of these mistakes by Inn staff - I had to find out from family and friends.  I was also never compensated for the lack of services.  \nI have filed complaints with the BBB and the Texas Attorney General.  There are so many beautiful places in Austin to have a wedding.  For the prices these venues charge, a person should not have to put up with rude, unprofessional staff.  I would definitely look elsewhere.","838":"Five stars for the games and selection, but minus 2 stars because the guy was a dick to my kid, who arrived a little ahead of me.","839":"This places service is awful. On top of the awful waitress, the management does not care. The people are rude, the food was overlooked and dry, and it took 30 minutes to get a beer. DO NOT GO THERE!","840":"Started coming here after a friend highly recommended it and have been ever since! So accommodating and friendly. Nina and Tommy always do such a great job! Acrylics, gel, anything... Very clean salon and always leave happy w\/ my nails! Definitely recommend.","841":"Absolutely delicious. Walked down Salem st and decided to stop in here. Server was extremely accommodating and knowledgable in regard to my dairy allergy. I ordered homemade pasta and a plain tomato sauce. The homemade pasta was incredible. Boyfriend ordered one of the specials, an eggplant parm\/chicken parm combo. We will absolutely come back here. A little pricy, but worth every penny. The ambiance of the restaurant is excellent as well!","842":"What can I say, too old and in a rough area. I need to start booking at newer and better locations. Been a long time customer and starting to see more and more locations getting bad.","843":"I'm back again. They're playing MGMT right now and how can that not put you in a good mood? \n\nAnyways, drinking the Honey Latte today. So delicious! Believe it or not, you can actually taste a hint of honey flavor. Mmm.","844":"Great wine, romantic atmosphere, good food, check it out!\n\nI had the grilled zucchini, roasted bell peper, and goat cheese quesadilla, which was excellent, and a glass of Malbec. They have a nice big round table in the bar with a fireplace in the middle, very cozy in the winter.\n\nThe happy hour food is also really good. I recommend the nachos.","845":"I really enjoyed the \"Armadillo\" chalupa w\/ extra added jalapenos. The Armadillo featured bison meat and traditional tostada toppings (cheese, matoes, lettuce) I was not sure what a chalupa was and was hoping it was not like the soft, flat bread filled gut bomb that Taco Bell provides.\n\nTo my gleeful surprise it was like a big curved tostada with a crunchy tortilla foundation. The bison was fresh and mild tasting and all of the other ingredients were also fresh and crunchy. The service was indeed prompt and kind and the nachos (one big tostada with melted beans, cheese and jalapenos) looked yummy. After a walk and a few hours passed, I did not feel the food clinging to my stomach---a good sign that it was light and fresh!\n\nI will definitely be back when I'm in the area again!!","846":"I went to Emma's Pizza based on its positive Yelp rating, however was very disappointed at the attitude of its hostess\/manager towards my friends and I. I had gone with a few friends of mine and we had tipped just below 15% for the service (did 14%) at the end of the meal, when the manager came out of the restaurant and told us that we needed to tip more. After respectfully telling him that this is not mandatory, he proceeded by saying that my friends and I are not welcomed to the restaurant and they would not serve us next time. The behavior that he displayed in front of my friends was very rude and I would never go to a restaurant with such an arrogant manager.","847":"Top notch service for us while visiting our daughter.  Be patient while following directions to this place with google maps or garmin, the highways and hills make it ackward to find.  Short haul\/walk  on dolleys and right at river in a few minutes.  Very friendly staff and reasonable price.  Call ahead on weekends","848":"With all the comments about the brisket, you'd think they would get it.  Boring brisket. My biggest problem was the meat was cold. Plates were cold, so the meat was cold when it hit our table. Really really like my meat warm..only complaint. Service good, people friendly. Just cold. Too many other places' in Austin to try. Why come back. Fix the brisket please.","849":"Great place and fun atmosphere for a girls night out or after work drinks! Precinct is located on the bottom floor of the Loews hotel, and has a really cool vibe to it. There's a large bar area with an attached outdoor patio, which was jam packed after work hours midweek. Off to the back, separate from the bar, is a nice dining room. The vibe is casual but city chic, and there's also a large patio off the dining room. I met some friends for apps and we chose to sit off the dining room patio, which was much quieter than the bar side, but just as nice! We enjoyed oysters, which were nice in size and served with a tasty mignonette. The Wild Mushroom Flatbread was quite large, and super tasty. The blend of mushrooms flavored with garlic and topped with a fresh farm cheese was served nice and crispy on the flatbread. The Watermelon and Feta Salad was nice and refreshing, served with large chunks of feta cheese and watermelon, served over arugula and drizzled with a balsamic glaze. The Buffalo Bleu Cheese Tater Tots were a hit, and not overwhelmingly spicy or cheesy. We also ordered a Flight of Sides, which allowed us to choose 3 sides- a complicated decision when so many of the options sound delicious! We went with the Parmesan Truffle Fries (yum!), the asparagus and the Brussel sprouts- all quite tasty. Overall a wonderful experience. There's a nice wine list, as well, with many great options.","850":"This was my first visit to this Blimpies. It was a Sunday morning. The food was really good. I will definitely be back this week. Sandwich had enough meat, but does not compare to the amount of meat that they use my home town, NYC. But that is the case with all the sandwich shops in Austin. I don't understand why that is. I will be asking for extra meat on my next visit. The restaurant is very nice. Lots of seating. The staff was great. When you visit, take your time when ordering. They have so many choices of breads, meats and fixings. Remember, you are the boss. They will make you sandwich they way you want it. \n\nThey also have Pizza at this location. I will review that on my next visit.","851":"My biggest nightmare has come true. They changed the bolognese. God help me. Why!!!???? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! They changed the noodles from these homemade wide noodles to a spaghetti\/linguini.....which I really don't think are homemade.....and it tastes different too......dear god help me.......it a sad day.......if you'll excuse me I need a minute......","852":"Pub grub and cold pint, what's not to love? Really nice staff and collection of locals as well as after work crowd","853":"I needed some additional photos so I had to place an online order months after the pictures were taken.  The good part was, the pictures were still available for purchase.  The bad part is while the pictures were $13.00, the shipping was $8.00.  Completely outrageous shipping charges.  In the future I will be sure to buy enough pictures in the initial order so I'm not charged for shipping.  There is also not a place for an online coupon or promotional code that would have helped save some money on the shipping charges.  They really screw you on shipping - so beware.","854":"Just had a 90 minute deep tissue massage by Alex. I found A-side massage with a groupon. Alex is knowledgeable & knows what he is doing. Very comfortable surroundings & excellent experience. I will be returning for sure.","855":"Hands down most unprofessional joke of a business I have ever experienced. Never eat, order or even waste your time dealing with these idiots. I can run a better pizza place out of my bathroom.","856":"We hit up this pollo about once ever week or so, it might be a while till the next visit. This past Sunday the place was packed, I expected to wait a while but waited almost 25 minutes for my meal. The place was a wreck, and our favorite mango tea was out. We asked the staff and they said they would make some, fine but 25 minutes later our food finally arrived and the tea was still not refreshed, I date directly across from it. When I asked if they had any in the back for the drive thru, they said no.  \n\nWhen it first opened it was awesome, every visit since has been slightly more disappointing. The portions get smaller, the chicken drier, and the wait longer. We will give it another chance before pollo makes the black list, the corn souffl\u00e9 and mango tea are they only thing keeping me coming back, I just hope they don't ruin those.","857":"Service is always great. Very knowledgeable workers. Never have any problems with this company whether its for plumbing, heating or a\/c. Always on time and they get the job done. Highly recommend Boston Standard for all your needs. Joe seems like a very nice and caring person who will ensure your needs are addressed and taken care of. Very efficient and organized company. Thanks and keep up the good work!","858":"My very first visit with Kyo, the sashimi was still regular sized. I have no idea what year that was, because now it's about 1\/16 of what the regular size was. The staff is still attitude is still the same from before. And I never expect much qualify from the food. If you're gonna go AYCE and expect 5\/5 food quality then don't bother going at all. Kyo is a place to go, if you just wanna get full and be satisfied. If you wanna eat sushi till you're sick of it. \nOverall, Kyo is not my favourite AYCE. But if I'm there, I know what I'm gonna receive. No more, no less.","859":"We had high hope (maybe too high) for this aquarium based on the great reviews. By far the biggest aquarium we've been to, but there's nothing special. Wouldn't come here again and probably should have done something else during our trip to Vancouver.","860":"At Riccardos. Just had the polenta tartufata with a great Sicilian red. Cinghiale stew next.\nSecond home!!!!!","861":"Their food is really good but everything else is horrible.  They quote you pick-up times and the food is never ready when you arrive.  On one visit, I got there and they hadn't even started making the pizza and another time they were just putting it in the oven so I cancelled it and they were upset with me.  Also, when you go into the store there is always a sense of confusion going on behind the counter and people are always getting testy with each other.  Tonight I called to order and the person that answered the phone made me feel like I was bothering them.  It's to bad because, like I said, their food is really good.","862":"You may find very good price cabinets but they are very busy and the shop owner have very little patient to speak with you.  They schedule way out (6 weeks or more).  And you can tell as he does not care for your business they rather deal with contractors.   The shop owner give you the sarcastic look when you are asking for question that a typical home owner would ask like can you custom order a pantry.  Yes I know this is prefrab place!   \n\nIt was funny to see a mom with 3 little kids there layout with Legos while she shops for the cabinet.\n\nThe rest of the staff seem very patient and want to help out.  But they can not make decisions.  They have to come back to the shop owner.  Our turn off was the owner yelling at a new employee he had just hired.  I don't do business with people who don't respect others.","863":"I was taken here by my Vietnamese friend, so I was tempted to give it 4 stars.  I figure he would know, right?  However, I don't think I would venture this far from home (NYers are lazy alright!) if he hadn't been driving and wanted Pho Oregon.  \nIt had pretty decent Pho (I didn't need to cover the flavor in hoisin sauce).  It lacks ambiance in the way that the Asian restaurants who have the best food are dirty and run down; but the dirt adds flavor according to my friend.  The service is fast and it's full of Asians--always a good sign!  The Pho is the same selection and price as every other pho restaurant.\nI'll be back as long as someone else is driving.","864":"Katie was an exceptional employee. Seemed to have great recommendations for my lifestyle and the fit of my foot. Made it enjoyable to be there. Good selection. Appreciated her professional input and kind demeanor!","865":"Great to work with!  Organized, fast, and very helpful with getting set up with my new wood stove.  The guys were very helpful in making sure I got everything I needed without trying to upsell me things I didn't.  Highly recommend them!","866":"This place should be renamed Market \"No\" basket. Its always packed with obnoxious people pushing, shoving and grabbing. I saw a woman throw a punch at another woman in here as the other woman accidently brushed against her trying to get through the crowded isles. I decided from then on, I would be taking my life into my own hands if I continued shopping at the market basket and really who needs that kind of stress to save a few $$$'s, I ended up being in a bad mood coming out of the pace and all I wanted was a few bread rolls and water!!","867":"For diners in Boston, it doesn't get better than this. Get ready for a high-school drama-themed menu with specials such as \"The Detention\" , \"The Princess\"  and \"The Janitor\". The Basket Case is my personal favorite and comes with generous portions of eggs, bacon, buttered toast, home fries, and french toast. Not a meal for the faint of waist.  Coffee is bottomless and the waitresses come around to check in on your cup frequently, true diner style. Thank you Emilio Estevez and Molly Ringwald for some of my fav breakfast in Boston.\n\nIf you're a first timer I would recommend arriving before 10AM on the weekends, if you would like to avoid the now loooong lines as this place is no longer a hole-in-the-wall find.","868":"Store is closing leaving everything 70% off.  This means the store is pretty much picked over already.  They have a fair amount of girls clothes left mostly infant.  Not really much in the boy department a few racks of infant clothes for boys.  There is nothing left in the area of gear toys ect.  Few bins of shoes that are almost empty.","869":"A girlfriend and I decided to check out the new oyster bar Select for a quick drink. We liked the urban feel to the small place and also the outdoor patio.  Since we just wanted a drink we grabbed two of the three empty seats at the bar. Shortly after the hostess came over and asked my friend to move a seat over to her left, which was confusing since neither side of us looked ready for the check. We moved anyway but since the seats are touching, the lady closest to my friend kept flinging her hair in my friends face. Not a very comfortable setting. We moved back to our original seats when the hostess wasn't looking.  We decided we had time. \nThe menu looked good but pricey. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked tasty but again we were just there for drinks. Ohhhh wait it's coming.......\nSo I originally wanted wine but since the cheapest red is $12 and cocktails $13.50 I decided to go with my regular grapefruit and vodka.  My friend ordered soda water and vodka. The bartender served mine in a martini glass and my friend's on the rocks in a tall glass.  That was a first. I drank maybe one - eighth of it but couldn't stomach the drink without ice and more juice. All this while my friend was almost done with her drink. So i ask the bartender to pour it on the rocks with more juice. The way I wanted it.\nTime for the bill. Ummmmmmm $13.50 for my friend's vodka soda and $13.50 plus $2.00 up charge and gratuity at 20% already included.  What the! $36 something for two drinks!  So I asked the bartender what the\"up\" charge was and she curtly responded that the \"up\" is \"industry standard\".  She asked me when I ordered if I wanted it up, not understanding I guess I said yes,  and then the bartender added ice and more juice after the fact.  Why didn't she ask my friend if she wanted her vodka soda up? I didn't order a grapefruit martini and after years of drinking this drink that's the first time I've ever had it served like that. I felt her intent was to belittle us.  I said she should've let us know what up was. And she said I could talk to the manager.  Mind you I am almost always a very happy and positive person who doesn't usually complain but when you pay for a service you should feel good about the service provided. \nI spoke to the management\/the owner who didn't make me feel any better.  She said she was sorry for the charge but she had to respect the bartender' s decision. \nI am still upset.  I feel I have been had and will never go back.  Isn't $13.50 enough for a two ingredient drink? Let alone a $2 up charge that you could clearly see I wasn't enjoying since it took me so long to take two sips? After being served our drinks we weren't asked again if we enjoyed them but isn't that industry standard?  The bar isn't even that big.  I had to flash the bartender to ask to  add ice. \nAlso,  you have to be a size four or less or super athletic to sit at the bar since the seats are touching. The guy next to us had to jump over the stool to sit. His date had to  pull the chair all the way out. This can be embarrassing on a date.\nAnd I'm sure if you order lobster you'll end up hitting the person next to you. Take my advice and skip this place. There are plenty of other fish in the sea.","870":"Solid local bar with friendly staff, good pub grub, and free trivia on Thursday nights!! Definitely a must go if you like German beer and food!! They have a back patio too which is cool. The trivia is really fun!!","871":"Stopped here on a whim. It used to be something else but I can't remember. Late lunch was well overdue by the time we stopped in. One order chicken fingers and fries, shrimp and grits, and a whiting fish sandwich, and 2 drinks almost $50 bucks, a little pricey for me. The food was good and the service was nice mainly because we were the only ones there. No complaints from the woman or the child so I won't complain either, but I will say that I don't think that this place is far enough into \"gentrified Atlanta\" to charge what they charge for everyday eats.","872":"I've been sitting on this review for a long while. La Sombra is a new, chic international bar and grill I know I should like. I know I should. I just didn't have a good experience with the appetizers we tried. So, below is my uninspired review of the appetizers. And below that is my review of the two drinks we tried. And below that is my review of the service. It's a bare bones review, but I can't seem to add any fluff to my experience. It is what it is...\n\nCebiche Hongos - Smells like gasoline. I cant even try it since I cant get over the intense, strong smell of gasoline. The bar manager said it could be the truffle oil. I've never had a problem with truffle oil. I won't go near this ceviche again, unless they decide to nix the truffle oil. IMHO cebiche doesn't need truffle oil. It's a waste on this item.\nGuacamole - Nothing special. Tastes like regular old guac.\nYuca Frita - Very good. Lightly fried yuca with cheese in the middle. The spicy mustardy dipping sauce is a wonderful compliment.\nEmpanadas (trio) - The powdered sugar sprinkled on top of the braised beef empanada is a really good twist on this empanada. A little like a salty and sweet empanada. The other two empanadas I don't care for.\n\nPisco Sour (Chilean) - Best Pisco Sour I have ever had. I've had a few in my day and always thought the flavor of Pisco was too overwhelming. Never thinking that again. This Pisco Sour was like a lemony froth of smooth sweetness. DELICIOUS!\nFig & Basil Martini- This is a great drink for someone who doesn't like an olive martini, doesn't like the sweet candy martinis, doesn't want a strong pure vodka martini, but wants to enjoy a martini. It's a natural sweetness that seems great for a mild drinking palette.\n\nThe service is grade A+.  If for no other reasons than I really liked the Pisco Sour and enjoyed the great service, I will give La Sombra another try. Next time I'll try the regular menu items and hope for the best.","873":"Excellent food, good sized protions at a great price.","874":"Kevin was my tech and he was great! He explained exactly what needed to be done, was quick, neat, knowledgable and very prompt. I highly recommend.","875":"This place has a tremendous reputation in the neighborhood. Personally, I am not into the rocker 1990's live bands with unfamiliar songs and gag props. Perhaps, it's my age or my queer sense of fun, but I much prefer the Burren to this place. Also, the cover is pretty expensive - about $10! I am no longer the poor college student, but I can't see myself handing over this much when I could be using it to get a huge JP Licks ice cream next door.\n\nIts saving grace is the Sunday night Salsa lessons and free pizza Mondays.","876":"Pretty fun place! Our waitresses were fun and helpful. I got a order of the nachos, which were ok, I've had better. The wings were hot! That's a good thing. lol and the drinks were strong.... thats a good thing too!","877":"Good grief! Is there absolutley no push for good customer service at any of the Lowe's stores?? \nI swore I would never again enter the Tigard location because of how I was treated (ignored and unable to get anyone to help me load garden pavers to my car). Now, I decide to try this Lowe's, because it was nearby and I got the same treatment. I was ignored and NO ONE would help me. I left and went to Home Depot - which was out of the way - but that I knew would be helpful. I was right. I was taken to the product I was looking for and was helped to load my truck.\nThanks for nothing.","878":"Not sure why so many people complain about the service here... I was seated moments after walking through the door, had a menu in my hand seconds after that, and the waitress came over to take my order as soon as I put the menu down. All I ordered was sushi and miso soup, but it was all very tasty. Can't speak to their Chinese food, but I will be back for the sushi.","879":"Such a historical place in Atlanta! I've been driving past this place all the time and finally made the decision to visit. There was pretty much no wait, we sat ourselves, and a waitress came by in no time. The portions were large and delicious and very well priced. I'm recommending the fried pork chops that came with biscuits, gravy, grits, and eggs. Hoping to come again to try the Ham!","880":"If your idea of fun at a concert is spending lots of time waiting in huge lines for food, drinks, and restrooms, then this is your place! Otherwise, there are so many better choices to see music in Austin. It's a real shame though that this is the place that seems to draw the big acts in Austin.","881":"I really enjoyed this place. I lived in NYC for 5 years, and this place definitely reminded me of a higher end family owned Italian restaurants in NY... Soho specifically. Not overly design\/contemporary but \"high end\" materials, etc. throughout.\n\nFood was fantastic and menu was unique and diverse. You could definitely tell that the chef was hands on with it's creation as everything had a nice twist to it. The Bruschetta was some of the best I have ever had... second maybe only to my mothers (and that is saying a lot).\n\nWhy am I only giving it a 4?... Service was above average but not great. The host was disinterested in my wife and I walking in, and (to no fault of their own), there was noisy road work\/construction going on right outside their door.\n\nWe will definitely be returning.","882":"We were here for the Patriots playoff game with a big group of people. Our server, Maia, was amazing! She was very attentive and organized and just on top of everyone's requests. I had the kale & quinoa salad with ahi tuna which was delicious. My friends had some desserts which they said were top notch (had a bite of brownie myself which was delish). It was an overall great experience on a super busy night. Thanks Maia!","883":"It's ok, but as others are saying, don't expect much.\n\nBreakfast was competent, nothing inspired. Coffee was very weak.\n\nBetter places include: \nLower wait: Gato Bizco Cafe, Ria's Bluebird, \nMedium wait: West Egg Cafe, Radial\nMore wait: Flying Biscuit, Highland Bakery, Thumbs Up","884":"After hearing good things previously about Alaska Airlines, when I was booked by the corporate office to fly direct from PDX to BUR this week I was anticipating a comfortable and pleasant ride.  Having traveled mostly on Southwest-who I love-I was looking forward to an even better experience, based on reputation.  This was not to be the case.\n\nFirst off, the baggage fee:  Southwest allows two bags no charge, but the $50 for two bags puts this out of competitive range.  Second issue is that the Embraer 175 jet is noisy and the seat backs in standard seating are hard and the seatbacks are not high enough for me to comfortably rest my head.  I am 5'10\", average height, so I wonder what demographic they designed this aircraft for?  I wound up with a backache by the end of the flight.  Due to the noisy engines (or lack of sound insulation in the aircraft) I had to wear earplugs for the entire flight.  Fortunately I had thought to put a set in my pocket prior to the flight, otherwise I am sure that I would have had a headache by the end of the flight to go along with my backache.   Next time, give me a good old Boeing or I ain't going!\n\nLast issue is that other than the flight crew, every Alaska employee that I encountered in PDX was borderline bad attitude.  Not rude people, but none of them seemed to like their jobs.  \n\nThe flight crew were great, very helpful and friendly, and are the reason that this review is two stars and not one star.\n\nOne positive item is that a variety of food items were offered for a charge, which is much better than the limited fare of peanuts and pretzels on Southwest.","885":"I'm not a cupcake conoisseur by any means, but with the plethora of little spots opened up in town in the past couple of years, it was inevitable that I'd eventually start sampling some of them! Especially since there are three shops within a half-mile of my house (Cami Cakes, Smallcake and Great Cupcake). \n\nI had occasion to try out the Great Cupcake Company at last month's Taste of Buckhead. They provided mini cakes as part of the pre-event food reception and they were pretty good. Lavendar-colored which was cute, and just a bit too sweet for me as far as icing goes. I ate half of a mini one - then again, I'm more salty than sweet, so take that for what it's worth. \n\nSince they're on my way to work (as is Smallcake) I may swing by one day to pick up some treats for the office.","886":"This place was way overhyped in my opinion. We came on a Sunday night so it was a little busy but the wait was only 20 min. As an appetizer, I got the popular steamed soup dumplings. Compared to other soup dumplings in NYC or Seattle, these weren't great. The brown inside was good but the meat was bland. As the entree, I ordered the beef knife sliced noodles. My other friends ordered the beef hand pulled noodles, one of which requested for extra thin. The extra thin noodles were better because it did make it easier to eat. The broth was okay. Not rich in flavor but not too bland either. The knife sliced noodles were very difficult to eat. I thought it would be wide flat noodles (similar to pad see ew) but they were very thick and difficult to pick. \n\nFortunately, they do give you a lot for what you pay for because barely anyone could finish their bowls. \n\nGood location, good parking, great prices, but the food (imo) was pretty mediocre.","887":"Got a recommendation from a friend so I tried it. Pizza was good but a bit overpriced for what it is. Not necessarily something I would go out of my way to get but if you're looking for good pizza in your neighborhood, it's worth it.","888":"Really great sliders. Well priced. The place is nice laid back. Good place to meet up with the buddies. I know they are known for the wings but they ran out. I will be going back. But all their food is worth the visit.","889":"Decided it was time for an update, since they've gotten their act together since my first disappointing experience (not) eating there.  \n\nChik Chak is one of many different food trucks \/ caterers \/ restaurants that set up rotating \"pop up\" lunches in the \"canteen\" at the IDB in Boston (via fooda.com\/idb).  As a frequent lunchtime customer, I've seen a lot of vendors underestimate the foot traffic at this venue (though it seems they may have been given some bad information at the start).  By now they've done this enough times to have a better handle on traffic volumes here - there are a LOT of people working in this building, with hundreds more moving in this year!\n\nSo that said, I'm sitting at my desk at work, eating my take-out lunch from Chik Chak (falafel plate with salad base and side order of baba ganoush w\/pita), and was inspired to come back and write another review.  Inspired specifically by their FALAFEL, which is easily the best I've had in years.  There are a lot of Middle East \/ Mediterranean style vendors that setup here on other days, and Chik Chak's felafel is better than all of them.  Just add grape leaves to your pop-up menu, and it would get 5-stars!\n\nTip for IDB tenants: Get there early - well worth the long lines!","890":"We went in last night for a drink and some food. Emma was our bartender and she was awesome. Came right over, friendly, and smiling. Got our drinks quick and the food came out fast and hot-which was delish!","891":"Taste is ok, there are better ones. But the chief might want to clean food better. My pork belly skin is covered with pig hairs.","892":"My boyfriend and I ate at Lucca to celebrate our 12-year anniversary on Friday evening.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by an entirely unpleasant hostess. Seriously, she needs to find another job. She never smiled (mostly she scowled). She never made eye contact. She rushed to our table and dumped the menus while I was still near the door hanging my coat, scarf and umbrella, leaving my boyfriend and me to wander back to our table by ourselves. She didn't bother to check if our table was satisfactory, which it wasn't. Because our reservation was early (5:00 pm), the restaurant was still mostly empty, but rather than seating us in the warm, convivial section of the restaurant at the front , she sat us in the back room in a dark, cold corner when there were lots of tables available elsewhere. We asked to be moved, and again, she didn't bother to accompany us to our new table. \nFortunately, the rest of our dinner experience at Lucca was top notch. I ordered the beet salad as an appetizer. Our server (Derek?) suggested cod fritters as an appetizer even though they weren't on the menu. Great suggestion! The fritters were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, not at all greasy, and came atop a perfect aoli (I think it had red peppers in it). The beet salad was light, delicate and super fresh with a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds. Yum!\nOur entrees were well prepared. I had the Maccheroni ai Funghi and my beau had the Tagliatelle Bolognese. Both pastas were well prepared and tasty. \nDessert was a scrumptious poached pear served over a pastry bed with chocolate and caramel sauce (like the fritters, it's not always on the menu hence suggested by our server).\nAfter we got past the surly hostess, the rest of our service was quite good. Derek was warm, friendly, helpful, and gave us just the right amount of attention. Even the busser was extra nice. The price was very moderate, too.\nI'd have given Lucca four stars were it not for the hostess. I hope that management sees this and gets rid of her. Lucca is far too nice a restaurant for her to be greeting your customers.","893":"Read Dannielle's S review:   exact copy of my experience.  Won't be back, and will share this story with as many locals as I can.","894":"Great Reuben, unreal rye breads and sauerkraut... this deli is going to make me convert to Judaism!!","895":"Free apples. I come here for the free apples and coffee. That's apparently the only bonus you get as a repeat customer. Every single time I've come to this dealership I walk out thousands of dollars poorer. Oy, my bank account cannot take anymore. If I can write off auto mechanic bills like medical bills on my 1040, I'd be a very rich woman.\n\nDamn you Herb Chambers!!! GRRR.\n\nIt's a nice facility, I do like the pickups\/drop-offs, getting a loaner car is easy and the mechanics are not bad, but c'mon! Can we get some competent customer service agents in here who understand a little about value!?\n\nAlrighty then, my rant of the week is over, thank you for listening :)","896":"My wife and I went to Cactus Club after getting in late to our hotel on a Thursday night. The place had a lot of traffic from the hotel, but wasn't too crowded. I had chicken fajitas, she had a wrap with sweet potato fries. Both entries were very well prepared and savory. The service, however, was a bit slow - no refills on water or beverages, or chips and salsa. The food came out extremely fast and hot, and was the high point. Atmosphere was also nice - although not overwhelmingly awesome. I'd return (in fact I will be returning for a group dinner there in a few days). Under $25 for dinner in downtown Boston isn't a bad deal either.","897":"The reason this place gets such high remarks by me and everyone else is very obvious. The shop is not a large fabric place but what Gay, the owner, has will meet the needs of anybody who appreciates good quality, beautiful pieces.  \n\nI went in for one specific decorating need but walked out thinking how I can make a \"shower curtain\" out of this piece and a \"pillow\" out of that one.  \n\nBut let's admit it, a place like this would not lose all of its wonders if the shopkeeper were pushy, disinterested or cold.  Gay is anything but.  She really loves fabric and her enthusiasm is inspiring.  She was extremly helpful and by listening to my color preferences and requirements she pulled out the perfect fabric for me.\n\nShe mentioned that she loves to teach too so she may be announcing a sewing class soon.  This is good because every now and then I think \"Wouldn't it be nice if I could hem my own pants?\"","898":"What a disappointment. I don't want to say anything too scathing because the owners of Singer Hill Gardens seem like nice people and I really believe they want to contribute to the local organic food scene. However the weekly shares were paltry, they cancelled the season after 11 weeks of the 25 promised, and there were a lot of other small problems that suggested they are inexperienced at farming and at running a business.\n\nI know a fundamental part of buying into a CSA is shared risk and I know this means that if I believe in this model I should support farmers through tough times. However the CSA model only works if the good years make up for the bad years and over the course of many years the customer gets a return on their investment that they feel is worthwhile. In the case of Singer Hill Gardens I think it's very unlikely they could deliver enough in future years to make up for this catastrophic year. I don't plan to stick around to find out. I think they're going to have a very hard time recovering.","899":"Came here for taste of yaletown with a friend I haven't seen in a while. The very first thing I noticed was how loud the music is. It was almost impossible to hear each other from across the table and throughout the night we were almost yelling at each other and perpetually leaning in to be able to have a decent conversation. Maybe this isn't such a great place to meet and catch up with old friends because of this. \n\nI got the Alberta Beef Tartare, duo of Lamb and the Peanut Butter Mascarpone Cheesecake. The portions were quite large for Taste of Yaletown so that was a pleasant surprise. The beef tartare was pretty good and came with bone marrow, which I love! The lamb dish was flavourful and hearty. And the dessert was delicious but might be too sweet for some people's liking. Overall it was an okay experience, and I think the biggest takeaway from this is that the music was a bit too loud.","900":"Don't ever order delivery from here. It's going on three hours and still no delivery. I called an they answered and just put the phone down and talked for about twenty minutes. Called back and the guy said he is waiting for the driver. Half hour later I called again and no one answers the phone. Food is good but the service sucks. The sad part is I live one block over.  Called back again and now they put the phone down so I can hang up as I listen to them just talk. This is a joke.  Now she hangs up on me. Didn't even come back to the phone.  Not sure where the manager is but this is such poor customer service. Will never order from here again.","901":"Listen folks this is a chain restaurant.  Its not a five star gourmet, nor is it a mom and pop shop working extra hard to get your repeat visits.  It is what it is.\n\nCame here last night for night out with friends.  Food was pretty good.  Nothing to complain about there.\n\nThe few things that knocked it down a bit for me:\n1. the bathroom was a disaster! toilet paper all over the place, seats wet with who knows what.  Floors sticky.  Now this was the rush hour dinner time, but my goodness someone needs to go in there and check it out a few times during their rush period.\n2. Waitress wasnt bad but not great either.  We were there for almost 3 hours so we tipped extremely well.\n3. No trivia because no other teams, this was the whole pooint of coming to this particular place.\n\nwe def will be back, because the food was good.  Drinks were good too.","902":"People may love this airline, not me! Seats are way small, people are great, but the Logan gate is in siberia.Gate Food service provided by Cosi is bad. Bad coffee.","903":"We came here for my husband's birthday a few weeks back and sat on the patio. I should add that it was restaurant week so that could have played a role in our (lack of a good) experience.\n\nLong story short - \n- Service was slow and lacking. \n- We were served the wrong beers (but didn't realize it until we got our second round and it was completely different and more accurate to the description).\n- Ambiance on the patio could use improvement. \n- The inside seemed safe and clean, which I appreciated. I would like to see hand sanitizers on tables, but that's just me not trusting other customers to bring their own.\n- Food was good, but not mindblowing... or maybe the other factors just made us enjoy it less.\n\nIt was an alright evening but nothing outstanding.","904":"Loving the new Havaianas store at Downtown Disney...  or should I say Disney Springs.  I still can't get use to the new name.  Oh well, back to Havaianas!  \n\nThey have a pretty good selection of various Havaianas here.  You can even choose a pair of solid colour Havaianas and design them yourself with various charms.  That's a really cool concept.  \n\nI wish the store was a little bigger.  It gets A LOT of traffic being at Downtown Disney and even during the off season, it gets really crowded in there.  It can be really hard to move around and it can be really difficult to get to the particular pair of Havaianas you want to look at.\n\nWhile the selection is decent, I still wish they had more.  Also, they always seem to be out of size 8.  That's a really popular size, so you'd think they'd order more.  They also don't have any other sizes in the back, so don't bother asking.  What you see is what you get. \n\nI have yet to purchase a pair from here simply because they never have my size in any of the styles I like.  I do really like Havaianas, so whenever I'm at Downtown Disney, I'll keep checking in this store.\n\nWould have been a 5 star review if only they had more size 8 flip-flops to choose from.","905":"okay..i went to this last year and i wanted to give a little update for people who are considering going this year (july 19th!). \n-the price has gone up from $40 to $50 in advance.\n-the drink tasting thing natasha mentioned was not the case last year. they stamped you for every beer. and the beers were tiny \"tastes\". that totally sucked. i also don't remember seeing a wine area, just a cambridge brewing company table and a narragansett table? but then i love narragansett so i probably never moved much farther away from that table :)\n-the way they work the tickets are you buy a ticket and it has numbers on it for each table. you go to each table and you get a stamp so you can't return. the only exception to this is that you get two free space stamps you can return to anywhere for. i used mine to return to ole for their delicious vegetarian tacos.\n-speaking of vegetarians, i am one and this was totally not the place for me. i left still starving which was ridiculous considering how much FOOD there was. and considering the fact that it was taking place in the people's republic of cambridge, home of harvest co-op and whole foods and all sorts of veg-friendly places, i was pretty pissed, and surprised that that would be the case. i understand each restaurant is going to choose what they make but not allowing any flexibility about the one-stamp policy sucked. i got there right when it started for non-vips and by the time i made my way halfway down to veggie planet's table they were out of food..literally. what does that tell you about vegetarians at this thing!! the worst part was since you had a square per table you couldn't really go back to the ones that DID have veg-friendly food. \n-also, the bukowski's guy was a TOTAL douchebag to me when i asked if any of their food was vegetarian..a not-unreasonable request considering all the vegan food on their regular menu. he pointed to fried chicken and told me that was vegetarian and that the mac & cheese or whatever was vegan. what an asshole. \n-i understand not every place in this world is going to accomodate every diet, so that's totally fine. i just thought i should give veg-people a heads-up so you don't expect to be able to gorge. it was a fun event and my omni boyfriend had a blast eating at every single table, especially since i usually gave him my stamps as well. \n\nit was really fun to go outside after work and walk around and eat little nibbles but gosh $50 is a lot, even if it is a great cause. i really hope they change their policy on the one-stamp-per-table policy because i would love to go back!","906":"We are here because of all the hype about the beignets and we were not disappointed! Everything was flavorful and the wait staff was attentive but not smothering. My boyfriend had the trout Benedict (not the official name) and I had the Jennifer Benedict, both very tasty, and the Chicory coffee was delicious. If you can, eat on the porch, it's enclosed but has a beautiful view.","907":"The food is good but the customer service is poor. I called in for a order for delivery and questioned the price for my order and was treated poorly.  I tried to explain to the man on the phone that all I wanted was an explanation so I know for future orders and he said for me to look at the website.  I told him what he was telling me I didn't see and that maybe he should check out his website because it's saying something different and he wouldn't listen. I asked for his name and he didn't want to give it to me.  I told him it was poor customer service and he didn't seem to care and that he has other people on the line.","908":"I am writing this review as I continue to wait for my food. 2 stars? Do they deserve it? Yes and no. Their food is really good I'd give it 4 stars. Ambiance is also pretty chill. It's a good place to go on game days and get something decent to eat while drinking and watching a game. I think it actually deserves 3 stars but I am giving 2 because I hope they acknowledge it and change something. \n\nOur bartender\/manager\/whatever the hell she is (still trying to read her name badge) is the rudest person I've met. Since we have been here twice with her as the bartender I feel the need to say something. Last week they weren't busy this week they are. She is still a b!$&@. I'm sitting here waiting on chips and dip and mention to my boyfriend how I don't understand why it's taking this long. She perks up and says \"what? Is there a problem?!!\" I thought she was going to fight me. I told her ya actually we have been waiting a ridiculously long Time for something you scoop and serve. She told us the cheese was what the hold up was but the couple next to us only ordered quac and it took them twice as long.. Who knows. She ended up  bringing out chips and said here's this for the time being. \n\nWe ordered food way before she brought chips out still haven't gotten it. Like probably 35-40 min ago. Last week she was busy flirting with one of the other bartenders and seemed annoyed if we wanted a drink. \n\nHere's my thing mad mex... Ur food is slammin!! I'd eat it anytime!! But when your bartender is being confrontational and acting like a huge asshole, that's when you lose quite a few stars. I understand if kitchens get busy and things are crazy. That's fine! But have someone out front that is good with customers and apologizes for the wait and tries to make sure your experience is ok. Our other friends left and didn't even have a chance to order food. They got their chips and quac left $5 on the table and walked out. I get that it's a campus bar and sometimes busy. But I expect better customer service. I shouldn't feel like I'm going to get punched when I ask about a 40 min wait on my food. Get it together mad mex..","909":"Josh and his crew were incredible! They came and helped us pack on one day and then moved us the next day. We had a LOT of boxes, furniture, and miscellaneous, not to mention stairs in one house. Lots of heavy lifting but they never wavered and got the job done. The cost seemed more than fair for the level of service we received. We are so grateful to Josh and crew!I I highly recommend JS Moving Labor to anyone in the Portland metro who needs moving help. You can't go wrong with this company!","910":"I avoid Starbucksy type places because the pastries and coffee are usually shiite.\n\nThis place brings it.  \n\nPastries and french press spot on.","911":"Probably the worst breakfast dining experience we've had! So bummed on this place. We waited for over an hour to be seated, and then another hour for our food. We only had 3 people in our party and we didn't get our food til almost 2 pm, so there's really no reason we should have had to wait so long for food. \n\nWe ordered the veggie Eggs Benedict, Biscuits and Gravy, and the Scrambled Eggs with sausage. Everything was cold, over cooked and hard. The biscuits were terrible- burnt and hard with no flavor. How do you ruin biscuits?! Needless to say the biscuits and gravy were terrible too. No flavor and cold. The eggs Benedict were totally overcooked- might as well have ordered hard boiled eggs. The scrambled egg combo came with potato pancakes, which weren't good either and not noted on the menu (would not have ordered the dish had he known they were potato pancakes). The sausages were cold and unappealing, and left, with most of the food, uneaten. \n\nThe slow service rounded out our 2 hour breakfast misery.. Maybe it was an off Saturday, but I really would not recommend this spot unless you have hours to kill for breakfast and don't mind overcooked, cold food.","912":"In this Argentine inn you have to make a reservation to enter, lack of ethics made us wait more than 20 minutes and the restaurant empty Just because they saw Latinos giving race preference to the white Anglo I do not recommend this place freeze\/burn Empanadas of yesterday for more than six dollars? am not, not,  not, never return here. \n\nEn esta fonda argentina tienes que hacer reservaci\u00f3n para entrar, que falta de \u00e9tica Nos hicieron esperar m\u00e1s de 20 minutos y el restaurant vac\u00edo solo porque nos vieron Latinos dando preferencia a los anglosajones No recomiendo esta fonda. Empanadas de ayer por m\u00e1s de seis d\u00f3lares Yo no regreso aqu\u00ed.","913":"Was looking for a reliable self serv\/drive thru car wash and seems like most of those are at those convenience stores.  Which is fine but they never operate properly and the person in the convenience store could care less.  So when I found the Palms I was excited to try it out.  Drove over and did the drive thru car wash and it was awesome!  You pay, sit in your car while the conveyer belt pulls your car along and gets it squeaky clean.  They also have self serv options for vacuuming and powerwashing although I did not use those today.  For $8 you just can't beat the convenience!","914":"Please understand that this is a very enthusiastic three stars.  If 3.5 stars were an option, that's what I'd go with. \n\nSilver Skillet is an old school greasy spoon type restaurant with all of your breakfast favorites. The food is very, very standard. There isn't anything that you're going to be craving in between visits. The two-egg breakfast is usually what I order, either with bacon or sausage patties. Unfortunately, the latter are sometimes dried out a bit. The biscuits and gravy is pretty good; please note that the gravy is not sausage gravy. The biscuits themselves are probably the standout of the items I've tried here. \n\nService is good overall. The servers are sweet, no-nonsense, and a little sassy. The last time I was here, we had someone with a serious nut allergy and our server was extremely helpful in outlining what was okay and not okay for her to eat. On the other hand, as I was trying to exit via a very crowded entryway, a crabby old server barked, \"Coming through!\" and shoved past me with her plates of food. Well, I was TRYING to get out of her way. \n\nBasically, this is an Atlanta institution because 1) it's been around forever, and 2) they turn out reliable breakfast and lunch standards in a prompt, friendly manner. I like to bring out-of-town guests here for a taste of the South and to see if they recognize the place from one or more of the many movies that have filmed there over the years.","915":"Best fish selection-Hands down.  But it ends there.  I've been coming here for years and have found all but one employee to be less than eager to help.  I guess I would describe this business as a \"self serve\" fish store.  You really need to know what you're looking for before you head in and don't expect somebody to approach you or ask if you need help.  This last weekend was a terrible experience for the 3rd time in a row.  There was only a few employees to the crazy amount of people in the store.  Yes, I understand there are times when it gets busy and you have to wait, but this is the 3rd trip I've made over the last couple months and each visit was the same.  Let me give details:  after finding the fish we wanted I had to go to the front to acknowledge that I needed help with fish.  I was told that I was next on the list and that it might be a while.  Well, literally 23 minutes later it was our turn.  (You should have seen the look of frustration on every customer's face standing around). It took less than 5 minutes to get fish and we went back up front to check out.  Well the line was over 12 people deep and 1 person working the register.  I stood to the side waiting to pay and the guy that helped me get the fish walked past me and my son several times.  So I'm thinking we will get called up because the guy had our fish on the counter and he saw us waiting.  Come to find out, we needed to get in the back of the line to check out.  This would be no problem-had the dude who saw us standing to the side would have mentioned that we needed to get into the line!  He knew we were waiting to check out, but it was as if he enjoyed the fact that he knew we weren't in line.  Damnit.  So back of the line we go and remember it's now well over a dozen people deep.  So we waited another 25 minutes from the time we got the fish until we checked out.  The wet spot is grossly mismanaged, which is too bad because of the incredible selection.  The employees are not friendly, the store is understaffed, the prices are typically high.  (I.e.:threadfin rainbows are $3.99 elsewhere.  At the wet spot they are $14.99 a pair). I've also noticed their online pricing often isn't reflected in the store.  Unless you know exactly what you want, expect little service, and are cool with a long wait I'd look elsewhere-like World of Wet Pets, whose employees are all very eager to help and incredibly nice.  3 stars only because of selection and the 1 cool Dude that works there.  (Skinny white Dude w\/ goatee)","916":"I went there to see if they could make a decent cafe latte and experience the ambience.  The first problem I ran into was the moon milk.  I gave it a try, but the counter barista wouldn't tell me what was in it.  The latte was too sweet and I suspected that they were covering up a bad coffee flavor, so I ordered a traditional latte, a double.  It was pathetic.  I couldn't believe how weak it was, it was mostly milk and water.  I wanted to demand my money back, but there was such a long line.  I thought how distorted things can get?  This place has a very good reputation, yet it serves the worst watered-down espresso ever, way worse than Starbucks.  I went down the street and got a latte from Once Over.  And by the way, the place is noisy.","917":"The food is really good, but servers are rude and i really can't understand why they charged me 2 dollars for asking a little bit huison sauce","918":"Stopped in this Saturday to use a Gilt deal I purchased for a 50 minute massage with Lindsey. The front of the building is pretty old and not the fanciest spot so I was a bit hesitant to head up to the space but I was so pleasantly surprised when I walked in. It is super clean, very nicely decorated, modern, and so welcoming. I was offered water and coffee right away and provided the standard paperwork. Lindsey took a good amount of time to understand what I was looking for in my massage before we got started which I really appreciated.\n\nThe massage itself was great! I get massages very frequently at all different spots around the city probably once a month paying both full price and trying different Gilt coupons depending on current deals and this was definitely up there as far as quality. Lindsey did a great job working out the tension in my shoulders which is a tough spot and even threw in an incredible scalp massage which I am not accustomed to in a normal massage, it was a great addition. I will 100% be coming back and would be more than happy to pay full price for a treatment here.","919":"I'm so glad everyone loves HavanaClub salsa nights at the GPAC. I worked with HavanaClub for almost three years, and it couldn't be a more plesant group of people! I don't dance Salsa, but am still more than welcome. Want to hang out with a great group of people check out HavanaClubSalsa.com and you won't be dissapointed. More to the point however, the GPAC (Greek American Political Club) is actually a private club who rents out their ballroom to Havana Club, I would tell you to check it out, but, like I said, it's a private club. There should be a thread on Yelp for Havana Club! So all of these reviews would get justice in their proper place.","920":"Hmm. No signage out front...just a door with a red elephant on it. Let's go up, shall we? Oh...$5.00 cover? This better be worth it...\n\nErm...ok, not my scene, but a solid three stars for sheer uniqueness. The place was PACKED, I mean, to the brim packed on a Friday night. I wanted a drink but the line to the bar was not budging. Finally a waitress came round and I screamed my drink order in her ear. I'm surprised she got it right considering the music is pumping so loudly that I wasn't able to hear myself think let alone understand what I was thinking. \n\nIt has a Moraccan theme of sorts...low seating, throw pillows, basically sit on the floor...normally I would not be adverse to this, but it's a BAR. That means drunk people spill sh1t all over the place. Pardon me for being picky, but I'll stand. That aside, the vibe here is cool and the drinks are good...it's a place to be seen...cause you can't be heard!","921":"This restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is phenomenal. It's a small space that only seats about 25-30 people so there can be a bit of a wait. I came at around 6:30 on a Saturday night and my boyfriend and I snagged the last table. \n\nThe menu is simple and the dishes are inexpensive. We ordered two small clay pot rices ($6.75 each) and saut\u00e9ed yu choy ($7.50) to share. The rice came within 10-15 minutes, which is very fast for clay pot rice, but the vegetable came 10 minutes after that. They probably forgot about it because the waiter had a moment of realization when he looked at our table and went back to the kitchen. Onto the food itself, both rice dishes were flavorful and tasted just like home. I ordered the Chinese sausage and bacon and my boyfriend got the chicken and mushroom. Both pots had a generous amount of meat on top. Mix the pot so that you get soy sauce on your rice! If you're a fan of the crunchy rice on the bottom of the pot like I am, mix right above the bottom layer so that you have a nice treat at the end. The small was the perfect size to fill us up. The vegetable was tasty and cooked just right, but it did come in a very small portion. I was disappointed to see that the dish cost more than a pot of rice ($7.50 vs $6.75) and there were maybe two handfuls of vegetable on the plate. \n\nOverall, I had a good experience and I'll be back for more clay pot rice!","922":"Delicious pizza! The pizza was yummy and the ingredients seemed fresh. I got the garlic crust and it was seasoned with fresh garlic, not just a powder or something. I liked the thickness of the crust, not too thick or thin, my only critique is that it was just slightly \"limp,\"  but I had it delivered so that could have been a time issue. The pricing is very reasonable too. I will order from here again!","923":"I ordered the 20$ bento plate and it was not worth that!  The chicken was actually cold and the service was subpar.  Don't think I will be going back.","924":"Great food. Great service. \n\nOH, and did I mention the COCKROACH that came out to greet me while I waited for my take-out lunch at the bar? \n\nRight...","925":"Well..I dont care for Chipotle AT ALL, but I rather eat there. The food here was meh,  nothing to write home about andp the workers to me seemed like they didnt want to be there and had attitudes. I just didn't like this place. It was dead empty and I see why. I will not return.","926":"This place is for enjoying its \"special\" atmosphere, old house, live music, interesting decorate, but not for food.","927":"$30 for a 60 min massage by students. It can't get any better than this. I'm a student myself so I appreciate a good deal when I find one.\nAlthough the massages are performed by the students, they are still really good, considering the setting that you're in.\nI called to make an appointment. I wish that they had online scheduling, however, I assume that they will have that option in the near future.\nThe venue was very minimalistic and clean, which is all that matters to me.\nThe massages are done in groups. You go and change in a changing room and are brought to the common area where a bunch of massage tables are set up. This didnt bother me. The lights were dimmed and there was music playing. Once I was on the table and closed my eyes, I forgot about everyone else who was half naked lying near me.\nThe place is kind of in an alley type place which looked a little sketchy but nonetheless, I'm glad there's a location in Boston. There's a ton of college students in this city and we could definitely use an affordable massage place.","928":"My husband and I were in Vancouver on Saturday so we thought to get poutine fries. When in Canada, right?\n\nSERVICE - The cashier that helped us was very kind. \n\nFOOD\nPoutine Fries - The fries were not crispy so that made me sad. I wanted crispy fries so it could balance out the gravy and cheese curds. You know, give me some texture! Though it was vegetarian gravy, it was really tasty! Wish the cheese curds were more melty and gooey but they were just blobs on the fries. \n\nOverall, I am glad we tried it but I think we needed to try other places to get the real essence of poutine fries.","929":"I am not a fan but my wife just abouts drags me to this place once a month.  They have everything you need for just about all occasions.\n\nWedding Registry:  First of all this thing like helped our marriage...seriously.  When we went there we had someone help us put together our wedding registry.  I didnt think we would need the person but person knew ALL too well what couples do when they are going through this process.  THEY FIGHT! Oh man, it was terrible and the women that helped us was like a veteran of the process, she helped discuss things and helped us find solutions, I dont think I could have made it through the whole process without here.\n\nPrices:  The prices are high, but the quality is good.  Yes, you have to buy one place set of silverware for $40 at least, but they last forever (so says my wife)  We have had our silverware for 3 years now and its really still quite nice.  Everything can always be 20% off. NEVER PAY FULL PRICE.  Join the club or sign up for it before you get to the store, I wish their coupons stacked though.\n\nClearance:  If you go there with someone small in mind, you might find it for 50% off, plus an additional 20% if you have a coupon.  So, it ends up being worth it to buy that $100 scale for just $30 instead.  You kinda have to get lucky though.  Often they have curtains and sheets.  We buy a lot of really cheap sheets on sale.  That helps us man the guest bedroom without have to pay an arm and a leg or go to Goodwill.\n\nGifts:  I always go here for gifts, its quite nice and they also gift wrap for you.  Even if you buy from them online they will gift wrap it for you.\n\nOverall, its pretty useful in our lives.","930":"This restaurant is a Columbus gem! The best lasagna I have ever had and the people are amazing. The bread will melt in your mouth. The limoncello martini is an all time favorite. Bring all your friends and dates (but only the serious ones).","931":"Most of it is very good, no matter the dishes or the amount. The only thing is the service. The waitress is a bit harsh","932":"I've searched high and low for a place like this in the Atlanta Metro area, since I haven't been reluctant to enjoy my share of wild game. However, it's disappointing because it doesn't seem like this restaurant is going to be around for much longer. Aside from my table and the three ladies seating at the bar there was only about three other tables on what should have been a busy Friday night. The experience wasn't the although I enjoyed my meal. The service was slow, I mean snail like and the individual steaks whether it was Elk, Ostrich, or Emu  were loaded down with a brown sauce which kinda took away from the steak. I would definitely give this restaurant another shot because I'm looking forward to trying the Kangaroo and the ambience was quite nice.","933":"NOTE: I didn't end up getting any work done here.\n\nI came here on a Tuesday evening planning to get my first tattoo. I don't do well with parking on the street so I parked in a pay lot not too far away near Slice. It was about $5. When I came in the vibe was pretty cool, they were playing music. A guy spoke to me immediately and I told him I wanted to get a small tattoo. He said okay and an artist came to help me. This is where things went south. \n\nShe came up to the front and I told her I wanted a small tattoo. Three words and a small symbol...but my main concern was the three words. I had some examples of the font on my phone and of the symbol. I showed her the pictures, where, and how big I wanted it to be on my body. She said it was too small and it wasn't possible. This was very confusing to me, because I've seen several people with the exact placement and size of the tattoo I was interested in. Not to mention the pictures that were examples were of actual tattoos...so how is it not possible? Anyway, she started to draw the first word on a sheet of paper. The one word was about as big as I wanted the entire tattoo. If the one word was this big that meant the tattoo would be about 3-4x the original size I wanted. I asked her again was there anyway it could be smaller. She said it wasn't possible. She suggested I get the words or the symbol. Honestly, it seemed like she wasn't at all interested in doing what I came in asking for. Mind you, I've been wanting to get these words for over 7 years...but my fear of needles stopped me before. The thing was I could do without the symbol the main thing was the words. Anyway, since I was there and really hype about getting it. I agreed to just the symbol.\n \nWhile I was sitting on the couch waiting for her to get the chair ready, I didn't have the best feeling. I'd waited this long, I could wait a few more days and go somewhere else\/get a second opinion. I went down to the chair and told her I was leaving for the beach in about 3.5 weeks...she was like okay there's no way you can get a tattoo today then. That was also a bit strange considering I'd called several shops and they all told me two weeks but that's whatever. She said it was $10 fee since she had to set her chair up. Ok. \n\nI know one thing I would never come back here after my experience which sucks because I was trying to support a black business. I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Maybe it's just this particular artist that has no interest doing what you're requesting...I'll never be back so unfortunately I'll never know. I went to another shop and they did exactly what I asked for.","934":"Stopped in for a quick brunch... Very pleased.. The burger was perfect :) The French Onion Soup was great !!  Had a strange but good  Coffee\nTequila Cocktail, I wouldn't have expected those flavors to work together, but they totally did. All the plates full of food goin' by around me looked tasty as well . Friendly and informative servers, Willing to offer advice about fun things to do and good places to eat near by.\nGive this place a go!","935":"Great ambience and the Fish Tacos r super Good , we also got the lobster Roll & it was very good","936":"Went for lunch and enjoyed the Al pastor taco and a Carnitas taco, very tasty with the hotter of the three sauces offered(orange).\n\nprevious visit for breakfast...\nplain jane breakfast tacos and decent coffee... brought to you by the Bert's BBQ peeps. Fortunately the animal trophy decor is absent from this place... The very good about this place is it's cleanliness, no crap music, an absence of television screens...\n\nPlace is open for special events and catering after 4pm... BYOB then as well\n\nNot sure what the plan is here, Bert's peeps have owned the property since 2008 and may be keeping something going while they wait for another tenant. Current biz model doesn't seem like it will reap much gold. Needs something to reel customers in... pie, gelato, good beer, whatever","937":"Came here for happy hour with friends the night before the ice storm started. \n\nServer was very attentive, friendly and accommodating. The place seemed pretty busy for a Sunday afternoon. \n\nTried out the monkey brains and the nigiri special. \n\nHonestly I wasn't too impressed with the fish quality or the monkey brains. It was ok, but nothing to come back for.","938":"This place has been around for years and used to be a favourite spot for my family to visit for pizza. I hadn't been there in over a decade but decided it was time the other night. We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza, Calamari and small chicken souvlaki. The service was great and the Calamari was tasty. The small chicken souvlaki is good but very small...4 bites of chicken. The pizza was a let down. Everyone at the table agreed it was very greasy and didn't have much flavour. I would say the greek food here is great and so is the service...but we won't be ordering pizza here again.","939":"I was craving macarons on the weekend and I was too far away from Thomas Haas.  I searched Yelp and found Thiery.  I can't help but compare this review with Thomas Haas.\n\nThe Almond Croissant is excellent as it is not too sweet, which I like.  The macarons are bigger than TH, the lychee flavour is wonderful.  It is my favourite one there.  I still prefer the macaron at TH but this comes close second.\n\nThe location is more convienient for me.","940":"I know it's April 1st but if the new owners think they can charge $9 for House Pinot Grigio in that location, it's going to be a fast ride till it's closed. Nice little bar, but $16 for a glass of Santa Margarita? Good luck with that guys. Let's get a Happy Hour ASAP.","941":"Calvin's was great throughout the whole process. They were accommodating and made sure we were taken care of. This was my first experience with a jeweler and Calvin's set the bar pretty high. Thanks again.","942":"If you love the taste of your mom's home cooked pho, then this is the place to eat.\n\nOne Sunday afternoon, we were on our way to a pho restaurant but then I remembered reading about Ha VL.  What caught my attention about this place was the fact that only a certain amount of soup is made daily.  Once the soup is gone, it's gone and the restaurant closes up shop for the day.  I thought to myself, the soup must be good and it was delicious.  I would suggest to call ahead to see what soups are available for the day.  We showed up around noon but they closed up shortly after we received our drinks.  I will definitely go back for some more.","943":"loved the salsa, hated everything else, service was unbelievably bad.","944":"OUTSTANDING Service!!!\nI had an issue that needed immediate attention and Dr. Kravitz came through! I was able to get an appointment to see him the same day and then, he and his nurse spent a lot of time with me going over my issues, testing, and options. I was then able to get in to see a specialist the same day. Then, after 6:00 the same day I received a call from Dr. Kravitz himself to let me know about the results of my testing. I couldn't be happier with the service that I received from the staff at Austin Regional Clinic.","945":"I'm seriously concerned by the 4 and 5 stars. I used yelp to help me find a good Chinese Restaurant. Me and the hubby are from the San Francisco Bay Area and chinese food is just plain awesome there. So, I was forewarned about this place being a hole in the wall so, that didn't bother me.\n\nHere's the 411 - we ordered the pork as recommended by yelpers. The pork was cold, oily and had no good flavor. \n\nWe then ordered the House Special Fried Rice and the Walnut Shrimp. So....first few bites of the rice, so far so good. The third bite, UNCOOKED rice. My hubster had the same situation. The Walnut Shrimp were huge but, after the 2nd shrimp, it just tasted like mayo and the walnuts were BURNT to a crisp. \n\nWe took the rest of the food to go and needless to say, my husband threw it away in the trash at the auto parts place down the street. \n\n$35 bucks down the drain. I see that there are a lot of people that do eat there, mostly Asian peppered with a few white people. I'm Asian and I would not recommend this place to eat. This place gave me the squirts...sorry for the TMI.","946":"Worst service ever, took forever for food and we have been waiting forever just to pay for cold food and drinks that took way too long.","947":"Very disappointed by the food here. I had high hopes from all the amazing reviews, but every single thing we tried ended up in the trash (this is coming from a girl who sees expiration dates as a suggestion and is in physical pain when she sees food wasted). I'm sure it's better if you are used to russian food, but to the inexperienced patron it was hard to stomach.This place gets 3 stars because of the amazing selection and how much fun we had weaving through the maze to the hidden bakery. It also seemed very authentic as we were the only second gen citizens in the place and there was only one employee who spoke enough English to help us. I'd be willing to go back to try the tiramisu and gyro, which we missed out on.","948":"I really wanted to check out the food cart scene, but a lot of places closed early!  This was one of the few that was still open late (like 7:00pm on a Saturday).  I ordered the pad thai with chicken and it was huge portion for like $7 and it came out piping hot.  Probably not my top pad thai of all time, but it was definitely satisfying.  And, you really can't beat the price.","949":"The gym and the facilities are great. Their policies don't make sense at all. Membership cancelation policies don't make sense at all. I was charged for 45 days of membership I didn't use. Not a great way of making profit!;","950":"I don't understand all the fantastic reviews of this restaurant.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest.  It was just ok.  However the lobster thermidor was over cooked and chewy!  It was NOT good.  Could have been good, since the sauce was tasty, but the overcooked lobster ruined it.  The steak tartar was ok, but it was in the shape of a hamburger which was a bit odd when eating raw meat.  The drinks were good and the service was excellent.  The food just wasn't all that.  For the money we spent, I would go elsewhere.","951":"We enjoyed this brewery as we were waiting in between a wedding ceremony and reception. Everyone enjoyed the beers they ordered and I loved that they had wine too. We split a couple of appetizers while we were waiting and all were tasty! \n\nWe were super confused when we walked in because we must have come in where the dining room portion is. It was awkward because it didn't look like the dining room was open but the sign said it was, no one told us where to go but we kept walking back and found the tap room. Little did we know the tap room had a separate entrance. I am now seeing there are several reviews noting that but it wasn't something we reviewed before walking in. I highly recommend to the business to make this more apparent, because it was very strange walking in on the wrong end! \n\nOverall we enjoyed the tap room space, there wasn't a lot of seating so we all stood around while we enjoyed our drinks but weren't there for long. Looks like it is first come first serve for tables in the tap room and people were hovering waiting for spots to open up. This didn't matter to our experience on the particular day we were in, but I do think I would have been bothered if I were in and super hungry without a place to sit.","952":"DO NOT USE THIS BUSINESS!!!  I called this guy on the phone just to get  a quote.  His response was most unhelpful and he hung up on me after I asked if he could give me a round about figure on what the repair would cost, what the per hour labor cost was, etc.  \n\nThese guys are RUDE.  I cannot believe that any business would be this way to any prospective customer.  What this guy doesn't know is that my company owns over 25 rental homes in Austin and I constantly need repairs.  Too bad for him.  He just lost my business and every builder\/investor I know will be aware to not deal with this company.  \n\nGood luck, Lorenzo!!!","953":"I went in for lunch and ordered the BBQ chicken flatbread. There was hardly any BBQ sauce on it and what was there was pretty flavorless. The service was fine but the food did not match the quality of the other options that are available nearby.","954":"I love this location, there are always plenty of helpful people around and they usually have everything I need. There is nothing I hate worse than having to walk around a big-box when looking for something small to finish a project, this Ace location is just big enough to have a wide selection, but small enough to get in and out in a couple of minutes.\n\nPricing seems to be close to in line with Lowe's\/HD, the difference is though that there are not 5 different selections on everything, so it can sometimes end up costing a bit more. I'll gladly trade 20 minutes for 50 cents though!","955":"My picky son was hungry so I only ordered 2 things from here.  Chicken noodle soup and steamed rice.  Order was quickly made behind a glass kitchen where you can look in.  It was very good and reasonably priced.  Noodle was thin crispy egg noodle and soup was not the thick starchy like Hot and Sour which is what my son would eat.  Chicken was very flavorful.  I would come here again if I was in the neighborhood.","956":"I called and made an appointment earlier in the week to have an oil change done and lo and behold once I get there, I'm not on the books. The desk girl was super rude and unwilling to budge that it was their mistake that I was somehow lost in the mix. She kept going on about I must have made the appt at another location, even though I confirmed on the phone with who ever took my appointment that I was indeed scheduled for the North Lamar location. Plus, it was the North Lamer location phone number in my recent calls not Cedar Park. I get that mistakes happen, but don't be rude. I walked out and will never be back.","957":"Nice ambience. The food is Asian inspired. The service was accommodating and the food was fresh. Not exactly \"Boston Seafood\" we were looking for, but seems to be a nice spot for drinks and dinner.","958":"I would say the food at Boston Pizza gets a max of 2.5 stars but due to my previous experience at the Boston Pizza in Richmond, I'd give this place 3 stars for better service. \n\nWe came here for Pasta Tuesday where all their pastas only costs you $10.99. We had the Jambalaya Fettuccini and the Seafood Fettuccini. For one, the pasta was not al dente and was way overcooked. I personally like my pasta to be a bit over al dente but this was to the point where it was too soggy. \n\nThe Jambalaya had a bit of a spicy kick to it and lots of shrimps but I'd much prefer to have more of the chicken. It was cheesy enough for me. The Seafood Fetuccini was served with a creamy sauce but it lacked flavor and was bland. Interestingly, we found more scallops than shrimps in this dish while the Jambalaya was overloaded with shrimps. \n\nFor dessert, we got the Boston Cream Piescrapper. This was HUGE. I never had anything that consists of ice cream and I couldn't finish. This would be it. I shared it with my dinning partner. We loved how the whipped cream on top with the chocolate drizzle complemented the multi-layers of the ice cream cake. I'm not a big chocolate fan so I didn't enjoy the chocolate cookie crumble base as much as my partner did. The whipped cream on the side was missing the chocolate & caramel drizzle, otherwise it was a very tasty dessert. \n\nThe service was average. Food came out at a reasonable time but it was served at room temperature, though I'd wish for it to be warmer. They came around to ask if the food was good and filled our glass.","959":"This was our favorite brewery on a recent trip to portland. Atmosphere was relaxed and cool and the beers were the most unique and delicious. So we went back the next day because it was that good!","960":"Ecofloors' installer Mario did a fabulous job with the marmoleum click tiles he installed in our kitchen and laundry room. The seams are all but invisible -- you have to look for them, and he went the extra mile to get the flooring and molding to fit beautifully around all the weird jigs and jogs (It's an old house). He dealt with unforeseen problems -- some rot in the underflooring and an ancient piece of asbestos-backed linoleum under that -- in the laundry room. He also offered to put in some baseboard that the previous owners had never got around to installing. The job took longer than he thought it would, but he never cut corners or left off to work another job. He had no problem picking up a different color of threshold molding for me because I wasn't enthusiastic about the first one he brought over. Mario takes a lot of pride in his work, is very skilled, and wants the customer to be happy. The guys in the office are responsive and easy to work with too. \n\nAre there any downsides to EcoFloors? It can take a while for them to get to your job because they're in high demand, and a couple times I called to check on where we were in the process. No big deal.","961":"Pretty good slow service and poor customer service, I went in to pick up my food and their was no one their to help me, when someone finically came they were very rude and yelled at me for using credit card.","962":"This is a very interesting concept for a restaurant. As a vegetarian, I often get left out of hotpot. There is usually meat in the broth or added to the stew. So I was excited to check this place out because I could have my own personal vegetarian hotpot.\n\nThe process is kind of like the Melting Pot. You are given ingredients, and you add them to your broth to cook. It can take up to a half an hour depending on what you order. They have a sauce bar with raw garlic, scallions, cilantro, soy sauce and other concoctions.\n\nOverall, my food was just ok. There wasn't too much flavor in my stew. I tried adding sauced and garlic, but the broth was just too mild. I also didn't like how long it took to cook my vegetables. I also feel like the price was too high for what you got.","963":"This place is great. Very helpful-and friendly  employees. I have used them many times and will continue to do so.","964":"I mostly get take out from here.  Always been very happy.  Their house salad is the best salad around, hand down.  The pasta's are always great, and the portions are huge.\n\nIf you like italian food, you won't be disappointed.\n\nI'm a repeat customer for life.  Probably had their food 20+ times with no slowdown in sight.\n\nI'm only subtracting 1 star because they got rid of garlic bread.  I get it, they give you free regular bread, but not being able to order garlic bread just seems strange.  I want to dip that sucker in my sauce!\n\nA++","965":"Tried Feed last night with my family -  Walked in and the ambiance was calm...well lit place. The wire fencing is a.cool addition. You do have to walk up to thw counter and order your own food, they give you a number and bring you your food. Staff was friendly but you can tell rather new and someone training. So if your patience is short, just keep this in mind. I personally dont have a problem with it. It does seem to have a full bar and a few beers on tap. About 8-10 tv's are mounted up around the place for your pleasure. They offer milkshakes which my bf ordered n enjoyed. They have those new coke machines that gives you the 100s of drink options. So those are always cool. Now thw food ....unfortunately I was dissapointed. I ordered the large white and one of my pieces was over cooked ...but the other three were good in the juicy department. However , although the consistency of the breading is good .... The taste is not. Its kinda tasteless. It needs seasoning. The coleslaw tasted like all mayo. \n\nThis is why I have given them a 3. The place was nice ...service was good...but I was highly disappointed disappointed in the food. My kids enjoyed their food n bf said it was \"ok\" hes had better. Just reconsider ur recipe Feed.","966":"Nice place in Boston to chill out, smoke a stogie and sip some nice wine. I brought my girlfriend here after a nice night out. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in the door, and hooked us up with two cigars that were exactly what we were looking for. The wine menu, although not extensive, covers most of the palates that walk into this place, and the prices are very reasonable. \n\nWhy not 5? Seating was a bit limited, and the wine menu could be extended a tad. Definitely a winner though.","967":"I own a home staging business here in Austin and I have used Mary DeMarco many times for my clients in need of window treatments.   She knows her products is easy to work with and makes the entire process very easy.  Ask for Mary DeMarco if you need help with your window treatment project! You won't be disappointed","968":"15 minute oil change? Nah, I showed up at 10:18 and I'm still sitting here at 11:06. This is ridiculous. Is there any supervision here that keeps these guys working quickly? One guy has been aimlessly wandering around, occasionally typing something in the computer. If you think you can get a quick change and head back to work DO NOT COME HERE.","969":"Fantastic good, beautiful spot and amazing farm- got the tour and loved all I learned.  Thank you!","970":"Best pizza in Sandy Springs! Why 4 stars? It's kinda expensive. My favorite pizzas were the specialty ones - using in season ingredients. And those are usually $12-15 for individually sized pizzas. And cocktails are $7-9 or so.... a little pricey for a pizza joint - but they're definitely catering to the Sandy Springs crowd. People tend to complain about Antico's prices, but this place is even more expensive. It does have perfect wood-fired crusts that reminds me of Naples, Italy... and Antico ;) Check it out if you're in the area!\n\nTip: Go during Happy Hour: 4-6pm weekdays = half off pizzas!!!!! Happy hour should get five stars.\n\nAnother Tip: Get the sweet roasted corn pizza with bacon and homemade mozzarella if you're there in the summer! I ordered it every time I went during the summer.","971":"Just finished having my haddock almondine and cup of clam chowder via takeout.  the haddock was delicious and cooked to perfection.  The clam chowder was creamy and tasted fresh.  SO GOOD!","972":"This is probably one of the more local, affordable izakaya places in boston. I love coming here for a small get together or just dinner with some sake. Place can get crowded on friday or weekend nights. \nPrice: 30 per person\nAtmosphere: bit loud, casual\nFood (+, Get): order their chicken or any other skewers, agadashi tofu, omusoba, chicken karage\nFood (-, Don't Get): If you're picky about freshness of sashimi, I wouldn't highly recommend it. \n\nDefinitely recommend if you live near the area.","973":"I'm really surprised that there are not more bad reviews so hopefully my experience was not the norm:\n\nNow I remember why it's been so long since I've had a manicure. When I walked in everything was just like a normal nail place. Same procedure, same tools, nothing fancy.\n\nI never get my cuticles cut so I requested she just use cuticle remover and push them back. This never seemed to be a problem anywhere else. \n\nWell, she butchered my nails- leaving all different shapes and lengths and she used a really rough nail file wich tore my nails up. She also tried several times to cut my cuticles after I specifically said no. I said again that I didn't not want them cut and she started to do one nail anyway! Instead of cutting she actually pulled and ripped the cuticle off which later led to the cuticles separating and caused a raw wound. I made her stop and she looked very surprised I was angry she went against my wishes. Should have stopped there and left- all the signs were pointing to danger, but I let her continue since she finally figured out that I wasn't kidding when I said I didn't want my cuticles cut. \n\nAs she was painting my nails I could see that she was doing a very sloppy job and pointed out that the paint was getting on my fingers, she said she would wipe them off with nail polish remover when she was done. But of course she didn't. And surprisingly she only did one coat, which turned out to be so thick that bubbles formed on every nail. She had to redo them, but not because the polish was too thick. It was because I \"touched my sweater\". What?!\n\nLike I said- hopefully this was an unusual occurrence because there are several good reviews on here, but while I was there I wasn't the only one with a problem- another woman had to ask the technician to go slower because she was hurting her feet ( and we were the only two in there so there was no reason to rush).","974":"The food was ok (I got the lobster roll with fries and Mac and cheese). Of course the roll is the main event and while the lobster itself was alright, it was odd that the lobster was served on a very small hot dog sized bun. The fries were also pretty plain. In all, the food was fine but nothing I'd write home about.","975":"Got mom a gift certificate for an HOUR long massage. She got in right before 6 to fill out paperwork. It was around 6:15 6:20 that she went in for her massage. She called me at 6:55, dressed and about to head out the door. She liked the therapist, said the massage was good, but what gives with the 45 minute massage? When I called to complain, they stated that they give the guests 10 minutes to dress\/undress. So in reality, you pay for 10 minutes of dressing and undressing. Not cool. Won't come here or get a certificate for anyone, anymore.","976":"In short, the best fried chicken I've ever had. Big pieces of juicy, perfectly seasoned chicken with a little bit of heat. All the sides and fries are also very good. All other chicken is ruined for me now.","977":"They basically saved my cat's life.  I had no idea what was wrong with him so I brought him over to Merwin only to find out that he had a clogged urinary tract which, left untreated for another day, would have probably killed him.  Although it cost me $1200 in surgery at another animal hospital, I am extremely grateful to this day that they were there to help me diagnose kitty's illness and help me find him treatment right away.  One vet there did misdiagnosis a cyst on one of my foster dogs (saying it was probably just a small cut-it ended up filling with pus and was nearly the size of a golf ball and required a regimen of various pills and ointments).  However, I understand that there is a time constraint on visits at Merwin and it is difficult to be thorough in a short period of time with limited utilities, so I would recommend them for annual shots and quick checkups.  For more serious concerns or issues they might be able to help you diagnose the problem, but you will have to get your pet treated at a clinic equipped for surgeries and more advanced pet medical problems.  Help out your local shelters and adopt! And don't forget to throw Merwin a donation on your way out.","978":"Friendly accommodating service. I really liked the quality and texture of the noodles.","979":"Got 3 rolls (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and pink lady), all were very disappointing. Lacked taste and fell apart easily.","980":"This was our first time here and I do not think we will come back. They serve a variety of burgers everything from bison to Turkey to chicken and salmon. My family had three different burgers and two of them had issues I asked the server if the salmon burger was a patty or a flia and the server told me that it was a patty so I asked what the binding agent was in the salmon and she said there was no fillers it was all salmon. I ordered it and it was not. On top of the service being very very slow it honestly took over 20 minutes just to get our check.","981":"Good food. Most of the time.  But.  It's.  Not Constant.    Need more choices in Orlando.","982":"Even for a cheap fill-up, not all HomeTown Buffets are equal.  I went to the HomeTown Buffet location at Plaza 205 today, and for selection and quality of food, it just isn't as good as the location on SE 82nd Avenue near Clackamas Town Center.  First of all, this location didn't seem to have much \"good\" stuff for entrees. . .their chicken was dry, the BBQ consisted of bones with just a shred of dried out meat, no butterflied shrimp, no pot roast, chicken pot pie didn't have a nice crisp crust, and meatloaf was tasteless.  (These items are usually very tasty at the 82nd Avenue location.)  Generally, I'd describe the food today as being bland and\/or dry.  This place needs to \"kick it up a notch\".","983":"It was a fun experience! I had never been before and was nervous about a long wait and crappy service (other reviews), but it was great! We showed up shortly after 10pm and were able to seat ourselves right away. My husband and I looked over the menu and the waiter came by maybe 5-10 minutes later. Our coffees were delicious and the Raspberry Fool was more than I hoped it'd be! The seating is pretty tight -- all the tables seem to be the same size whether your party consists of 2 or 6. Love the decor!","984":"I freaking love the breakfast club. Yeah, its a greasy spoon side-car diner, and you do get yelled at for singing along with all the amazing 80's music, but isn't that the whole point? Honestly, where else can you get a solid dose of some of the best music of the 1980's and some of the most amazing chocolate chip pancakes and over easy eggs for under 10 bucks? If you haven't been you should go. It will change your life.","985":"Affordable plates, the chicken parm was very traditional, sauce was straight out of Rossano. I must admit I expected more.\n\nWhile my dish was comparable to that of Sbarro's; I hear the Lasagna & pizza are local favorites. I'll check it out next time I'm in Boston.","986":"The Small Feast for 2 with beverages was $25 a very good value included Smoked ribs , thinly slice smoked turkey breast, thin sliced brisket, smoked chicken breast, pork choose the sloppy pork (excellent) corn on the cob, cole slaw (just they way I like it), BBQ beans were sooo good, the Garlic bread was the best ever.  We would eat here again and recommend to friends and others.   The atmosphere is kid and family friendly.  Didn't get the salad bar but saw several tables eating and enjoying it.  Plenty of food easily have another meal to go.  Warm friendly place.  There was a table of police and a lot of locals eating there, which tells me the food is good and fairly priced.  Not a fancy place.  Was clean and had good smoked BBQ.","987":"One-word impression: KOSHER\n\nI don't find myself in St. Johns often, but I was looking for some food out there the other day before getting down to some frisbee golf. I found my way to Proper Eats, and though I am not a vegetarian, I came away quite impressed. I had the Tempeh Reuben, which was awesome. What set it apart from other reubens that I have had (aside from not having pastrami), was the quality of the ingredients. The use of Dave's Killer Bread, the freshness of the sauerkraut, and the smoothness of the dressing really elevated the sandwich into this delightfully light pleasure. Maybe next time I'm back in St Johns, I'll have to sit down and have a more \"proper\" meal. I'm sure it will be worth it to hold off on my carnivorous ways for the experience.","988":"Rain or Shine. Please give me back 45 mins of my life. \n\nMe and my gf waited in line for 45 mins for our ice cream cone.  If I'm waiting 45 min for ice cream, it'd better be damn good.  It wasn't.  The flavors we tried - salted caramel and coconut chocolate chunk, were pricey and disappointing. \n\nThe coconut chocolate chunk was very bland, and the chocolate didn't really come in chunks, it was more like small flakes. The salted caramel was just way too salty, I couldn't even finish it. \n\nTo be fair, the waffle cone was good. In a city where there are many high quality ice cream stores\/gelaterias, Rain or Shine needs to step up their game.  I really don't get the hype of this place unfortunately. I will be going back to Earnest instead.","989":"Our waitress (Hollie) was excellent. She was attentive knowledgeable and very friendly. The shift manager, Derek was also very good. The food was a 3 star as well as the drinks my husband has to send back a Long Island ice tea.","990":"Prices are good but service is atrocious. Don't make the mistake of calling them for assistance. They'll minimize your every question and treat you as if they absolutely don't want to rent out any of their cars to anyone! They hate people and business! I have a stomach ache from talking to them. \n\nAnother massive flaw, we wanted to rent cars for our employees for several months which would have generated thousands of dollars in revenue, but found out the person picking the car up has to be the person paying for it? We can't make put that on them, that would be so unfair. this is the 21st century! we even have self-driving cars, so what kind of outdated service is that?","991":"Unfriendly staff, unaccomodating setting, and overpriced slices of unnappealing pizza (slices mind you, not full pies) are all ingredients to the worst pizza joint in Niwot. I reccomend a walk across the street to Abo's. Look even to Little Caesar's for improvements to all I've listed above.\n\nEDIT\n\nThe business replied to me with a few comments. I'm editing my comment to reflect what they said.\n\nPizza is, nominally, not overpriced. $1.50 per slice is reasonable for a good slice. Not for this. Establishment defended themselves also by stating Little Caesar's does not sell by the slice. True, but $5 for a pie or $1.50 for a slice of what, in my opinion, is not good pizza.\n\nThey also called me\/my review \"embarrassing\". I can't quite be bothered with that. But really, is that the best way to change my mind and persuade me? How about \"Sorry for a poor experience. Come in another time and we'll show you some TRUE hospitality!\". They'll have none of that I guess. I had hoped Lefty's would look at this review and look upon ways to improve the customer experience.\n\nNow a disclaimer. You may want to visit this store. You may like their pizza. Go ahead. I don't. I won't.","992":"There are a few important things that I look for in a place that promotes itself as a real sports bar:\n \n1. A lot of TVs to show sports.\n2. A willingness to help customers and actually put on the games they would like to watch (even if they are unusual)\n3. Plenty of space so that you're not on top of one another.\n4. Good food and drink selection.\n\nThere are a bunch of places that do a pretty decent job with 1\/3\/4 (and Game On does as well), but the reason why I will keep going back to Game On is that they nail #2 on the list. They understand why someone would want to go to a sports bar in the first place- not because they're necessarily looking to see the same nationally televised game on 3 out of every 4 screens in the place, but rather because they're hoping they will be able to catch a game there that they couldn't watch in their own home. Whether it's mid-level NCAA basketball or college hockey, I've always been impressed at their ability to 1) find the game I'm hoping to see and get it on quickly, and 2) make every effort to accommodate either myself or a group of friends in a place where we're sure to be able to watch easily.\n\nUnlike other bars where I've had to hunt high and low for a manager to change a channel (and then gotten a response as if they can't be bothered), I've always found the management staff here to be both visible and happy to help. And that is enough to ensure I return there again in the future.","993":"It was a decent stay, there were a few negative things  in particular that motivated me to wrote a review. Few things:\n\nPros:\n1. Good location in relation to Disneyland & Universal Studios & lots of shops, food, & convenience stores nearby.\n\n2. Cleaning crew did a fairly good job & the maintenance guy was helpful.\n\n\nCons:\n\n1. An intensely thriving blackish mold on the adjoining  room door; I will include pictures.\n\n2. On our last night, the lock on my parents door stopped working & they were unable to get in. \nThey called the front desk which told them to come to the lobby to get their key reactivated.\nThe lock to the door seemed to be the issue, however, my dad went & got the key-card reactivated, tried it & confirmed it was the lock that was broken.\nMy parents called again only to have the front desk tell them \"well you're calling from a room\". Yes, they were calling from another room, that wasn't their room. BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN STUCK OUTSIDE THEIR ROOM FOR 20 MINUTES NOW. This wasn't helpful, respectful, or professional. \nThe front desk said they would send a maintenance man immediately. \nMy parents waited another 10min with no help & called again. The front desk said they had already sent someone. Parents waited another 5 min & the maintenance guy came saying they had just called him. \n\nOverall, an okay experience.","994":"If you haven't eaten here, you don't know what you're missing.  Turkey Po-boy?  The best.  Chocolate eclairs?  You won't find anything better.  And if you're a chocolate lover, give the Chocolate Bomb a try.  Just don't try to eat more than one...","995":"I grew up with curries, Tom yum Soup, Larb, Phad Thai, and all of the other Thai food standards. Being that Thai is my favorite ethnic food, I pride myself on being somewhat of a Thai snob, while enjoying the Northwests' great Thai food establishments with plenty of \"Squee\"type reactions. City Thai is tucked away off of Capitol Highway, hard to see from the street. You'll have to be looking for it in order to see it. The restaurant interior is small, and very open. Almost every table is visible from where we sat, and there aren't private booths. It's easy to hear others conversations...This may not be to the liking of some, but I didn't mind much.\n\nI was very impressed with what I had at City Thai. We ordered the Red curry, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Tom Kha soup. The Tom Kha arrived first, impressing me with its galanga root and lemon grass (most places either take it out, or don't use the root\/grass). Tom Kha was made to have these non-edible (yet surprisingly delicious to munch on) flavor embellishments, so I was very happy and anticipating a fine full meal ahead.\n\nMy first experience here proved to have poor service, but every visit since, the service has been friendly and prompt.\n\nThe Pineapple fried rice was amazing. The Pineapple was warmly cooked, yet still juicy. It was almost like a sweet meat and the red curry was full of flavor and perfect on top of rice. All of the dishes had a dimension of flavors that you can't get from a canned or bottled paste, and it was nice to taste the multitude of flavors and care the cooks obviously take with their meals. They know Thai food.\n\nThe prices at City Thai are comparable, and they have plenty of coupons available (even some at the front door) to subsidize the cost for those that fear the rising cost of Thai food in Portland. \n\nEdit: Being a thai food snob, and after giving this place a second chance, I've become a full on City Thai junkie. This is now my favorite Thai place in Portland and it's SO close to home!","996":"It was a nice but it seemed short for some reason.  Tour was probably 10 mins and then we went into a room to taste beer that lasted abot 10-15 mins. It is a free tour so I can not complain. Our guide was great I forgot her name but all the staff was very polite. If you like beer be sure to visit!! So for a free tour you get beer and a glass to take home. Who can beat that???","997":"Ehhh... \"carne asada\" no es carne asada. Los sopes parecen tabiques para darle en la cabeza a alguien! Porq est\u00e1n tan gruesos?? No entiendo. Wouldn't willingly go back, there are FAR better options than this place. Not authentic and most def not even worth the trip... and I'm 5 min away. Would rather eat chipotle's version of Mexican than this place.","998":"I didn't want to use a huge company, as my move wasn't huge, and I found the best place! Brad was super helpful, really kept me informed of when he was coming to drop off or pick up the boxes and asked if I needed more time. I really couldn't ask for better. I'll never use regular cardboard boxes for moving again. It's nice to get them, pack, move, unpack and then they disappear! All with no worries about where to put everything when you're done.\n\nThanks again!","999":"Ehhh not impressed.  I have been here twice and loathe their wine selections (ew), the fact the the bartender ignores me for app. ten minutes, and also that there is no where to sit unless you also want to eat.  Standing in heels after a full day at the office SUCKS!
