The SAE numbers are based on a `typical\\'\\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \\n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\\n\\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal\\' temperatures just have\\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\\ncold temperatures have a `W\\' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\\nplace, you\\'d stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\\n\\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal\\' operating\\ntemperature and a `cold\\' one (though I can\\'t remember the numbers...).\\n\\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\\nsomething.\\n\\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\\noil.  Thin oil won\\'t (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \\nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \\n\\nIf you\\'re planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you\\'re making short drives,\\nstick to the 10W40.\\n\\n\\n--\\nDON\\'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!\\n'"
