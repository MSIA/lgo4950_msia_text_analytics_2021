lebanese resistance forces detonated a bomb under an israeli occupation patrol in lebanese territory two days ago

three soldiers were killed and two wounded

in retaliation israeli and israelibacked forces wounded  civilians by bombarding several lebanese villages

ironically the israeli government justifies its occupation in lebanon by claiming that it is necessary to prevent such bombardments of israeli villages

congratulations to the brave men of the lebanese resistance

with every israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral bankruptcy of israels occupation and drawing attention to the israeli governments policy of reckless disregard for civilian life

brad hernlem hernlemchessncsuedu very nice

three people are murdered and bradly is overjoyed

when i hear about deaths in the middle east be it jewish or arab deaths i feel sadness and only hope that soon this all stops

apparently my view point is not acceptable to people like you bradly

hernlem you disgust me

 first of all i never said the holocaust

i said before the  holocaust

im not ignorant of the holocaust and know more  about nazi germany than most people maybe including you

uh oh

the first sign of an argument without meritthe stating of ones qualifications in an area

if you know something about nazi germany show it

if you dont shut up

simple as that

 i dont think the suffering of some jews during wwii  justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government

any  attempt to call civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is  not appreciated

all jews suffered during wwii not just our beloved who perished or were tortured

we all suffered

second the namecalling was directed against you not civillibertarians in general

your namedropping of a fancy sounding political term is yet another attempt to cite qualifications in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument

  in article aprnysernetorg asteinnysernetorg alan stein writes   i guess hasan finally revealed the source of his claim that israel   diverted water from lebanonhis imagination

     alan h stein asteinisraelnysernetorg  mr waterhead  i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers in fact i said that  israel went into southern lebanon to make sure that no  water is being used on the lebanese  side so that all water would run into jordan river where there  israel will use it head

of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more difficult

you have not bothered to substantiate this in any way

basil do you know of any evidence that would support this

i can just imagine a news report from ancient times if hasan had been writing it

newsflash cairo ap ancient press

israel today denied egypt acces to the red sea

in a typical display of israelite agressiveness the leader of the israelite slave revolt former prince moses parted the red sea

the action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment

egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been denied their livelihood by the parted waters

pharaohs brave charioteers were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the red sea to return to their normal state

unfortunately they suffered heavy casualties while doing so

from kocrizeeceorstedu cetin kaya koc subject re seventh century ad armenian math problems organization college of engineering oregon state university lines  nntppostinghost rizeeceorstedu  problem    my father told me the following story

during the famous wars between the  armenians and the persians prince zaurak kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds

three times in a single month he attacked the persian troops

 the first time he struck down half of the persian army

the second time  pursuing the persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers

the third  time he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army

the persians who were  still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to nakhichevan

and so from  this remainder find how many persian soldiers there were before the massacre

 answer a  a   corollary armenians strike slaughter destroy and massacre

after all they are not as innocent as the asala network claims

 stuff deleted   i wrote  are you calling names or giving me a title

if the first read your  paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the  um well debate again

hasan replies i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too unless you consider yourself deserveless 

unless you are referring to someone else you have in fact given me a name i did not ask for hence the term name calling

hasan writes  so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom     i replied  if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at  least spell them correctly

sigh

hasan gloats that was only to confuse you

ha ha ha hey  hellbent on retarding into childhood no

when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories

 no i am not neglecting that im merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right  are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here

no i really do try to spell correctly and i apologize if i did confuse you

i will try not to repeat that

 to live a as you so eloquently put it human right

we can get back to the  question of which law should be used in the territories later

also you have  not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights

first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically revokes the right of for its military men

clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate

ok let me rephrase the question

i have repeatedly asked you if the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and if so why

from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred that you thought so

together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of israel

re your statement of occupation id like you to define the term so i dont have to repeat this drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary

secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights

im sorry but the above sentence does not make sense

please rephrase it

 if a state can deprive all its citizens of human rights by its actions then  tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all

because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant

oh ok

so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others

does the name of hama sound familiar

or how about the kurds in iraq and turkey

how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia

do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you

  and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem

  the question is not which system would solve the me problem

why 

because  any system can solve it

 the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine

  i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for   all people involved

i assumed that was obvious but i wont repeat that  mistake

now that i have straightened that out im eagerly awaiting your  reply

so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights

i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

no im agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties

if thats what you refer to as the israeli solution then so be it

 joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization  said it best when writing in his diary in   between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both  peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal     of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country

 the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of  the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than  to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to  transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be  left only after this transfer will the country be able to  absorb the millions of our own brethren

there is no other way out

 davar  september   courtesy of marc afifi   just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to  getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas  charter thats the english translations if you have other information id  be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to  a private paper even older

im not going to get into the question if he  wrote the above but its fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have  their share of fanatics

guess what

those are not the people that will  make any lasting peace in the region

more deleted stuff exactly you are right

i guess that the problem is that the israeli govermentis full with men like joseph weitz

oh

have you met with them personally to read their diaries

fascinating

what do you do for a living

 we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which

  well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the  imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem 

  i think that is fair enough 

  no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve  the problem

you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by   any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would resolve it justly

an unjust solution would be a nonsolution per definition no

you said the following for all a it holds that a have property b

there exists an a such that property b does not hold

thus either or both statements must be false

 guess where that takes your logic

to nevernever land

you are proving yourself as a  

first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic

too bad for you the master of wisdom

i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning

since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out before you started using your statements to prove a point or so

am i then to assume you are not logical

 the greatest problem of zionism is arab children

 rabbi shoham

  oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are  a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit

why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in  if you were a zionists

if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism

if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism

if you are not zionist why are you bothered then

you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts

any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all individuals by a statement of an individual

if you use the same methods that you credit zionists with then where does that place you

oh by the way id advice you not to assume anything about my loyalties

i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman but ill try as long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people

by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel the leaders of israel political andor religious or the jews in general

if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible instead

how would you feel if we started condemning you personally based on the bombings in egypt

subject re wasgo hezbollah

 even the most extemist one sided jewishisraeli postings with which i  certainly disagree did not openly back plain murder

you do

  the lebanese resistance you are talking about is a bunch of lebanese  farmers who detonate bombs after work or is an organized entity of not  onlylebanese well trained mercenaries 

i do not know just curious

  i guess you also back the killings of hundreds of marines in beirut right

  what kind of resistance movement killed jewish attlets in munich  

  you liked it didnt you 

   you posted some other garbage before so at least you seem to be consistent

  dorin dorin lets not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered

the distinction is not trivial

murder happens to innocent people not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed

it just so happened that these soldiers in the line of duty were killed by the opposition

and resistance is different from terrorism

certainly the athletes in munich were victims of terrorists though some might call them freedom fighters

their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters

dont forget that it was the french resistance to the nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in wwii

diplomacy has not worked with israel and the lebanese people are tired of being occupied

they are now turning to the only option they see as viable

dont forget that it worked in driving out the us marc   some people are so narrow minded they can see through a crack in a door with both eyes

sumgait azerbaijan on february  my wife and i went to baku to go shopping and returned to sumgait at around five in the evening

we ran into one of my relatives at the bus station and got to talking

a lot of people had gathered not far away near the store

well at first we didnt know what was happening and then a fellow i know comes up to me an azerbaijani guy and says what are you standing here for

go home immediately

i asked whats going on

he says whats the matter cant you see theyve overturned a car and theyre killing armenians

he helped me catch a cab and we got home safely

we sat at home for two days

during that time a gang of bandits came into our courtyard

but the neighbors wouldnt let them in the building

there were about  of them

they had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands

they were shouting something but you couldnt understand it

it wasnt one voice or two all of them were shouting in a chorus

they turned toward building 

they went up to the third floor and we see that theyre breaking glass and throwing things out the window

after a while they come out the entryway one has a pair of jeans in his hands another has a tape recorder and a third a guitar

they went on toward the auto parts store

we had to save ourselves

after midnight on march  we went to hide at school no

 which is in microdistrict 

there were two other armenian families there with us

there were  of us altogether

out of all of them i had only known ernest before he had moved to sumgait from kirovabad

the azerbaijani guard at the school let us in

at first he didnt want to but there was nowhere else for us to go

we had to plead with him and talk him into it

we were told that on that day the st there would be an attack on our microdistrict

we went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor

on the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important

i called one of them and the first secretary of the sumgait city party committee answered

i asked him for assistance

i say were in school no

 we need to be evacuated

well he says got it wait there im sending out help now

i know his voice

the first secretary had been to our plant i had spoken with him personally

when i called he said muslimzade here

about two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school

we looked out the window and about  to  people were outside saying armenians come out were here to get you

they have clubs axes and armature shafts in their hands

the guard sat there with us and asked where should i go

i say if your life is of any value to you youll go down there and say that the armenians were here and that they left

thats what he did

he went down there and said the armenians were here he said i let them out the back door they went that way

and pointed with his hand

and with shouts and noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed

so the assistance we had been promised did come

they sent us help all right

instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own

i am positive that muslimzade did that

no one had seen us entering the school no one knew that we were there

in any case we stayed at the school until seven in the morning and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid

in the morning we went to my relatives in microdistrict  and the soldiers took us to the sk club from there

the club was jammed with people and there were lots of people ahead of usthere was no space available

one small boy about three months old died right in my arms

there wasnt a single doctor nothing

the boy was uninjured there were no wounds or bruises on him

he was just very ill

they gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation they did everything they could under the circumstances but were unable to save him

and his mother and father a young armenian couple were right there on the floor 

i searched for a spot for us in the sk we have a small child of our own i wanted to find a room or something to put my family in

i went up to the third floor there were a lot of soldiers up there bandaged with canes limping with their heads broken open

they were a terrible sight

young guys all of them

there were a lot of bandaged armenians too

everyone had been beaten everyone was crying wailing and calling for help

i think that the city party committee ignored us completely

true there was a snack bar a sausage was  kopeks or  kopeks a package of cookies that cost  kopeks was being sold for  a bottled soft drink cost a ruble 





but there was no way to get the things any cheaper

i met my old uncle aram mikhailovich there

he saw me and tears welled up in his eyes

my whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples that we worked together he always had azerbaijanis over at his house

and now he saw me and there was nothing he could say he just cried

you can understand his feelings of course

 in article cwjjjrnewsflashconcordiaca ilyessececoncordiaca  ilyess bdira writes    why do jews who dont even believe in god as is the case with many   of the founders of secular zionism have a right in palestine more   than the inhabitants of palestine just because god gave you the land

 gd has nothing to do with it

some of the land was in fact given to the  jews by the united nations quite a bit of it was purchased from arab  absentee landlords

present claims are based on prior ownership purchase  from aforementioned absentee landlords award by the united nations in the  partition of the palestine mandate territory and as the result of  defensive wars fought against the egyptians syrians jordanians et al

     why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of   the inhabitants are not jews and do not want to be part of israel

 first i should point out that many jews do not in fact agree with the  idea that the west bank is theirs

since however i agree with those who  claim the west bank i think i can answer your question thusly the west  bank was what is called the spoils of war

hussein ordered the arab legion  this is very funny

anyway suppose that in fact israel didnot attack jordan till jordan attacked israel

now how do you explain the attack on syria in  syria didnot enter the war with israel till the th day 

by the way it is funny that you are implying that the reason behind  by israel was only to capture sinai egypt 

 to attack israel which was a poor move seeing as how the israelis  promptly kicked his butt

the territory is therefore forefeit

retaining  possession of all of the west bank is not desirable but it beats  national suicide for the israelis

put another way one could ask why it  is that so many palestinians seem to think that telaviv belongs to them  and the future state of palestine

as long as this state of affairs  continues it seems that to give the palestinians a place from which they  can launch attacks on jews is a real poor idea

giving up the entire west  bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint

in addition there is  the small matter of jerusalem which is considered to be part of the west  bank

the chances of the israelis giving up jerusalem are nil

even  leftists who think yasser is a really cool dude like yossi sarid arent  going to propose giving up jerusalem

if he did hed get run out of town  on a rail

   chag sameach

 jeff

the first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda is that zionism without antisemitism is impossible

zionism agrees with the basic tenet of antisemitism namely that jews cannot live with non jews

thats why the zionists decided that zion must be gentilerein

what

they didnt

you mean to tell me that the early zionists actually granted citizenship in the jewish state to christian and muslim people too

it seems elias that your first point to note is wrong so the rest of your posting isnt worth much either

in article mucitaprveincsrochesteredu mucitcsrochesteredu bulent murtezaoglu writes  henrik country

turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the henrik karabakh conflict with azerbaijan

bm gimme a break

capital letters or not the above is pure nonsense

it bm seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities  henrik again armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves

what do henrik want them to do

lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them

news reports ive seen say otherwise both location and motives wise

caps dont change facts

bm while hoping that turkey will stay out

stop and think for a moment bm will you

armenia doesnt need anyone to drag her into the conflict it bm is a part of it

henrik armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged henrik training azeris militarily to fight against karabakhiarmenians

so

should i at this point break into caps and start talking about defense etc

i dont know how fully engaged turkey iswas though

henrik the karabakhiarmenians who have lived in their homeland for  henrik years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are the henrik ones directly involved in the conflict

they are defending henrik themselves against azeri aggression

bm huh

you didnt expect azeris to be friendly to forces fighting with them bm within their borders

henrik well history is sad

remember those are relocated azeris into henrik the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime

so i hear

this justifies bloodshed n years after the fact

henrik at last i hope that the us insists that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never henrik occur again

bm youre not playing with a full deck are you

where would turkey invade

henrik it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped henrik into armenia if she could

why would turkey do that

do you not realize that this is a local clash that turkey never wished to see happen

turkey has other plans for region like economic revival cooperation etc

good stuff in other words id be happy to bicker with armenians over trade barriers and such on usenet rather than who killed whom in what way which i detest doing and wouldnt do

bm are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with scg

in the header bm in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun

henrik absolutely not 

i am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik cases history repeats itself

even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke turkey as was done in 

if thered been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their families

i have no wish to go into the cyprus quarrel but i suspect what ive said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved bm yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes bm she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring bm the parties to the negotiating table

thats hard to do when armenians bm are attacking azeri towns

henrik so let me understand in plain words what you are saying turkey henrik wants a peaceful end to this conflict

not 

so what do you think we want

war death and destruction

henrik i will believe it when i see it

no if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it

henrik now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a gun pointing henrikto your head 

do you sit there and watch or defend yourseffat chance

this kind of childish rhetoric doesnt help anthing

henrik do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku 

all the henrik barberian acts especially against mothers and their children

i mean henrik burning people alive 

now some azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by armenians

one should rehash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive right

bm armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the bmfutility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis thats bm going to cause incessant skirmishes

henrik armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic

they are henrik not asking much

they simply want to get back what was taken away henrik from them and given to azeris by stalin

well they obviously arent getting anywhere with their current methods of asking not very peaceful id say

bm think of  or  years down the line  both of the newly independent bm countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe bm the other out

these people will be neighbors would it not be better bm to keep the bad blood between them minimal

henrik dont get me wrong

i also want peaceful solution to the henrik conflict

but until azeris realize that the armenians in henrik karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion

i dont know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans

peace isnt whats happening right now furthermore whats happening right now isnt condusive to peace

you can spend days and nights raving about how right the armenian position is and im sure therell be others whod be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side

if entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise

armenia isnt strong enough to exercise the we think were right and we have the bombs so well do whatever we want so there style of foreign relations

yes you can type stalin in caps and give one sided atrocity stories etc

but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side

you personally can choose not to do that of course this being just usenet

the people in power shouldnt be so childish

bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes bm your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of bm their blood and future

henrik again you are taking different turns

armenia has no intension henrik to grab any land from azerbaijan

the armenians in karabakh henrik are simply defending themselves until a solution is set

azeris would disagree with you on this and the maps ive seen support what theyd be saying

it doesnt seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner

bm its easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled

the armenians bm in armenia and nk will be there with the same people you seem to hate bm as their neighbors for maybe  years more

the sooner theres peace in bm the region the better it is for them and everyone else

id push for bm compromise if i were you instead of hitting the capslock and spreading bm inflammatory halftruths

henrik it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative

i am absolutely henrik for it

it didnt look it when i read your posting

it would seem to me that if you can spew misinformation about a boogeyman you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness

fair

henrik but in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be wiped out

such as the case in the era of  of henrik the armenian massacres

you dont realize i can say the same thing about the turkish massacres

yes boys and girls lets always talk about how bad and nasty things were

lets do that so were overwhelmed by anger and lets do that so our kids will also be hateful

sounds crazy doesnt it

dont do it then

sumgait azerbaijan really people in town didnt know what was happening on february 

i came home from school at  oclock being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to baku

when we left everything in town was fine

life was the same as usual a few groups of people were discussing things soccer and other things

then we got on the sumgait bus bound for baku for my first cousins birthday my father my mother and i

we spent the day in baku and on the th somewhere around  pm we got on the bus for home figuring that id have enough time to do my homework for the next day

when we were entering town near the story highrises our bus was stopped by a very large crowd

the crowd demanded that the armenians get off the bus

the driver says that there are no armenians on board then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no armenians on board

the group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one not checking passports just going by the way people look

we get off the bus but are not taken for armenians

we set out in the direction of home

at first we were going to go into an old building where we knew thered be a place to hide but the whole road was packed with groups of people all the way from block  to the th microdistrict

these groups were emptying peoples pockets and checking passports

people who didnt have passports with them were beaten as well

then we decided to go home instead

near the story highrises i saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways yelling

death to the armenians was written on the cars

when we came into the courtyardwe live in an lshaped buildingit was still quiet

we went on upstairs but didnt turn on any lights

we tried to call baku to warn our relatives who were due to arrive on wednesday not to come

then there was a knock at the door

it was our neighbors who advised us to come down to stay at their place

we went down to their place and they led us to the basement

they live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony

we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was beatenshe ran away naked

our neighbors daughter said that thats right thats what the armenians deserve because in stepanakert allegedly people were being killed  girls from agdam had been raped

we didnt stay very long in the basement

we tried to support one another as best we could looking out the small window with the iron grating

papa watched and said things now and then

he said that there was a fire near building  probably a car on fire

then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where armenians lived

the neighbors said that there werent any armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of the building

they appeared from the  side of the building where i later found out a woman had been murdered

the woman who ran away naked died

yuri avakian was killed too

when the crowd left the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home

we went back up to our place and again didnt turn on the light

we started to gather up our things in order to leave sumgait for a while

we tried to call a relative who lived in sumgait but there was no answer

we decided she had already left

we sat at home

the phone rang and the caller asked to speak with my father

i called him to the phone

it was jeykhun mamedov from my fathers work brigade

he said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town

he asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city

to be quite honest papa didnt want to give him our address but my mother got on the phone and told him

some  minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway

bursting into the building they broke down the door and came into the apartment 





they came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the armenians were

they came into our place

we tried to resist but there was nothing we could do

one of them took my parents passports and began to read them

he read the surname danielian turned the page read armenian and that alone was enough to doom us

he said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard where they would have done with us

another standing next to him pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled

they had knives and steel truncheons

i had a knife in my hand

unfortunately i didnt use it

i just knew that if i didnt give up the knife things would be much worse

they struck my parents and said that i should put the knife on the piano

then one of them commanded that we be taken outside

one person was giving orders

when we were taken outdoors i went in the middle and my mother was behind me

someone started to push her so shed walk faster i let her go ahead of me and fell in behind her

when he tried to push me i hit him and at that moment they began beating my parents i realized that resistance was completely useless

we are taken out into the courtyard and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next

the crowd surrounds us

at first they strike me and im knocked out when i come to they beat me again 





i lose consciousness often 





i dont see or hear my parents since i was the first one hit and was out cold

when i come to i try to pick them up they are lying next to me

the crowd is gone the only people around are watching from their balconies

thats it

i try to pick them up but cant

my left arm is broken

i start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance

the bodies of my parents are still warm

we were attacked at around  oclock

i regain consciousness at about  and try to make it up the stairs home 





when i knock at the neighbors door they push me back and tell me to go away

i go up to the third floor our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment

i often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived but i cant see very far as a result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken away

then i calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away and everything will be ok

but they were still there

later at  in the morning as i found out the ambulance picked them up but they were already dead

if they received attention on time it is possible they would still be alive

later around  oclock on the th policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some assistants

they call an ambulance and  minutes later it arrives and i am taken to the sumgait emergency hospital

there they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm

at  oclock i and the other armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to baku

in my ward at the sumgait hospital there were five people all of them armenians

the hospital was nearly overflowing with armenians

the only azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events before the th

then i was in the semashko hospital in baku

i was there  days

when i was released on the th day i found out that my parents were dead

at first they told me that they were in moscow being treated but later i found out that they were dead

my fathers older brother told me

my fathers name was nikolai artemovich danielian

he was born in 

my mother born in  was seda osipovna danielian

papa worked at pmk the leader of the roofing brigade mamma was a compressor operator

they were also beaten on the head

the coroners report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely

at the confrontation i met jeykhun mamedov who had called

as it turned out later he had been the one who tipped the crowd off

he had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group

he knew the phone number but didnt know the address

before the events i had never seen him but had often spoken with him on the phone when he would ask to speak with my father

i knew him by name

he denies that i was the one who answered the phone saying that my father answered it

he denies that he called from a public phone saying that he called from home which also isnt true

i heard noise and the sounds of automobiles

as i later found out earlier he had been convicted but had never served any timehe had received a suspended sentence

he was about  years old

i dont know if he has since confessed or not

i am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off

onehundred percent sure

my parents were from karabagh

father was from the village of badar and was two years old when his family moved to baku where his elder brothers were to go to school

he was a student at the naval school but never graduated

he went off to work on the virgin lands one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under khrushchev

when he returned he lived in baku and later moved to sumgait helping with the towns construction

mamma was from the village of dagdagan also from karabagh

she worked in sumgait first in a bookstore and later on a construction site

my sister is older than i

she lives with her husband here in karabagh

i always loved my parents

that was why i went on to th grade because it was their dream that i would continue my studies

i finished th grade and wanted to enter the baku nautical school and after that the military school

but later i changed my mind or rather my parents got me to recon sider saying that it would be better to finish the th grade and then join the naval school

i was planning to be in the navy almost my whole life longsince childhood i had dreamed of being a sailor

my father wanted it more than anything

he always recollected his youth telling of the school and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it

now i live in karabagh and never plan to leave here

i will stay at the home of my grandfather of my ancestors till the end of my days

while in the hospital in baku i learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well like ishkhan trdatov

he managed to hold them off at their residence in microdistrict  building  apartment 

for a long time lost his father gabriel and by some miracle managed to survive

i also learned of uncle sasha from building  whose daughter was raped 





besides them valeryi forgot his last namewas in the hospital too about a year younger than i he went to school no



he was riding with his parents in the car

people were throwing rocks at them he was hit and his parents brought him to the hospital and he was in our ward

we even came to be friends

before that we had just seen each other around town

but in the hospital we got to know one another better

i learned of the fates of others those who had died or who were befallen by misfortune 





today suren harutunian the first secretary of the communist party of armenia was shown on television

to be honest i am glad that armenia agreed to recognize nagorno karabagh as part of the armenian soviet socialist republic

i was repelled no revolted to hear the baku announcer who read the decision of the azerbaijani supreme soviet presidium against karabagh becoming part of armenia

after the events in sumgait and those in baku the best solution is to give karabagh to armenia return it to armenia since the people want to live peacefully with the azerbaijanis but everything has to be right before they can do that

i arrived in karabagh on april 

i felt very bad

i had constant headaches

after a while my strength returned

my older sister suzanna took me in

i think that justice should prevail the people are demanding their due

you cant take away what is their due

my parents and i often spoke of nagorno karabagh often visited herespent almost all of my vacations here

we had even decided that if karabagh would be made part of armenia we would move here for sure

we always said that the armenian people had suffered much and that what had been done in removing nagorno karabagh from armeniawas wrong

sooner or later mistakes should be corrected

and in order to correct a mistake it must not be repeated and the fate of all nagorno karabagh lies in the hands of our government

actually nyc is more comparable to the gaza strip the controlling authority would probably be pleased as punch to unload it on someone else  but noone seems to want it

 heck nobody ever mentions what yitzak shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the way abdul nidal does today

seems isrealis are nowhere above arabs so therefore they have a right to jerusaleum as much as isreal does

ahistorical bullshit

shamir fought the british who incidentally shipped whole shiploads of jews back to the nazis for extermination and hung those jewish fighters that they captured and didnt want to deal with anymore

shamir did not attack civilians on airliners cruise ships in airports sports events movie theaters markets on buses and children in schoolyards

 i said the fixation on bosnia is due to it being in a european country  rather than the third world  ken says intervention in somalia is a counterexample i am a staunch republican btw

the irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on vietnam has not escaped me

i was opposed to us intervention in somalia for the same reasons although clearly it was not nearly as risky

 based on the same reasons

you mean you were opposed to us intervention in somalia because since somalia is a european country instead of the third world the desire to help somalia is racist

i dont think this same reason applies to somalia at all

no you have completely misunderstood

i was opposed to intervention in somalia for the same reason i am opposed to intervention in bosnia  there is no security interest of the united states there which justifies risking the lives of american servicemen and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them

in the case of bosnia the risks are obviously much greater and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the us

the whole point is that somalia is a third world country and we were more willing to send troops there than to bosniaexactly the opposite of what the fixation on european countries theory would predict

similarly the desire to help muslims being fought by christians is also exactly the opposite of what that theory predicts

you continue to misunderstand

i did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist  you seem to be overly fond of using this word btw

i said the phenomenon was racerelated which is not the same as racist

perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp motives  i said the attention and outrage at the entire yugoslavian situation was a result of it being  closer to home  happening to people we can identify with and  relentlessly harped on by the media

i never said anything about which side would be preferred which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors

i think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in somalia the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to bosnia if the newspapers and tv news i see are any guide

source the times  march  massacre uncovered by anatol lieven more than sixty bodies including those of women and children have been spotted on hillsides in nagornokarabakh confirming claims that armenian troops massacred azeri refugees

hundreds are missing

scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last wednesdays massacre by armenian forces of azerbaijani refugees

from that hill can be seen both the armeniancontrolled town of askeran and the outskirts of the azerbaijani military headquarters of agdam

those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their own lines

we landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last troops of the commonwealth of independent states began pulling out

they left unhindered by the warring factions as general boris gromov who oversaw the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan flew to stepanakert to ease their departure

a local truce was enforced to allow the azerbaijaines to collect their dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest

all the same two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby armenian positions

in all  bodies could be counted at the scene

at least another  have been taken into agdam over the past five days

these figures do not include civilians reported killed when the armenians stormed the azerbaijani town of khodjaly on tuesday night

the figures also do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies zahid jabarov a survivor of the massacre said he saw up to  people shot down at the point we visited and refugees who came by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and of leaving a trail of bodies along their path

around the bodies we saw were scattered possessions clothing and personnel documents

the bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre

all are the bodies of ordinary people dressed in the poor ugly clothing of workers

of the  we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing uniform

all the rest were civilians including eight women and three small children

two groups apparently families had fallen together the children cradled in the womens arms

several of them including one small girl had terrible head injuries only her face was left

survivors have told how they saw armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

the last arab country was syria

but not all of them migrated due to the jewish state economical and securital dilemma

as usual when salah is not totally racist she manages to get virtually all the facts wrong

assad pledged to allow jews to leave syria but not to go to israel

unfortunately not all of them have escaped yet but not because they dont want to leave rather assad went back on his word and stopped issuing travel permits

he claimed bureaucratic snags but everyone knows it was a tactic to pressure israel

from pgfcunixbcccolumbiaedu peter garfiel freeman subject re israels expansion nntppostinghost cunixbcccolumbiaedu replyto pgfcunixbcccolumbiaedu peter garfiel freeman organization columbia university lines  because the usa is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the israeli ecconomy any more

there is no money for such an occupation

  dont fool yourself

it was the gulf war that brought the israelis to the negotiating table

once their us backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else

  phill hallambaker oh why do you expose your ignorance

the us has been running on debt for the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases

and after the gulf war israel could do whatever it wanted after not decimating iraq after the scud attacks

it was encouraged but by no means forced to negotiate

mr baker to address all of your points would be impossible but in a nutshell it is hypocritical for you to attack israels presence in lebanon without attacking syria

syrian occupation has been hostile and amounts to annexation

israels is clearly defensive

if it were not defensive you would see all of lebanon occupied and governed by israel

but that is not what israel wants

pete

i understand how israel captured the teritory and feels that it is its right to annex it

i cant fully understand why it has to deal with palestinians much the same way jews were treated before the holocaust the final solution by hitler

what i totally dont get is why the us has to subsidize the existance of such a thorough abuser of human rights

the comparison youre making is not just totally off base but offensive to all sane people

friendly rivalry perhaps

perhaps yigal is a greenpeace member

  while i applaud investing of money in yehuda shomron vchevelazza  in order to create jobs for their residents i find it deplorable that  this has never been an active policy of any israeli administration  since  with regard to their jewish residents

past governments  found funds to subsidize cheap read affordable housing and the  requisite infrastructure but where was the investment for creating  industry which would have generated income and jobs

the investment was there in the form of huge tax breaks and employer benfits

you are overlooking the difference that these could have made to any company

part of the problem was that few industries were interested in political settling as much as profit

 after  years yehuda and shomron remain barren bereft of even  middlesized industries and the jewish settlements are sterile  bedroom communities havens for in the main israelis both  secular and religious who work in telaviv or jerusalem but  cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs

true which leads to the obvious question should any investment have been made there at the taxpayers expense

obviously the answer was and still is a resounding no

 since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either arab or  palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn

 is one form of propoganda more reliable than another

the only way  to determine that is to try and get beyond the writers political  agenda whether it is on or against our side

  tim first let me correct myself in that it was goerbels and not goering airforce who ran the nazi propaganda machine

i agree that arab news sources are also inherently biased

but i believe the statement i was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the israeli accounts the americans are biased

i just thought that the israelis had more motivation for bias

the un has tried many times to condemn israel for its gross violation of human rights

however the us has vetoed most such attempts

it is interesting to note that the us is often the only country opposing such condemnation well the us and israel

it is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights violations

so maybe there are human rights violations going on after all

 buch of crap and you know it

nagarnokarabagh has always been part  of armenia and it was stalin who gave it to the azeris

go back and  review the history

if a dogs prayers were answered bones would rain from the sky

did you know that the word karabag itself is a turkish name

before  before the russians and their zavalli kole armenians drove all the turksmuslims out it was a turkish majority town

well anyway it is not surprising that armenians also collaborated with the nazis

wholly opportunistic the dashnaktzoutun have been variously pronazi prorussia prosoviet armenia proarab projewish as well as antijewish antizionist anticommunist and antisoviet  whichever was expedient

  john roy carlson arthur derounian cairo to damascus alfred a knopf new york  p 

as a dear friend put it the tzeghagrons armenian racial patriots was the youth organization of the dashnaktzoutun

it was based in boston where asalasdpaarf terrorism triangle is located but had followers in armenian colonies all over the world

literally tzeghagron means to make a religion of ones race

the architect of the armenian racial patriots was garegin nezhdeh a nazi armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with hitler in world war ii

in  he had been invited to the united states by the central committee of the dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the americanarmenian youth

nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local armenian youth groups in the tzeghagrons

starting with  chapters in the initial year the tzeghagrons grew to  chapters and became the largest and most powerful nazi armenian organization

nezhdeh also provided the tzeghagrons with a philosophy the racial religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity

race above everything and before everything

race comes first

now wait there is more

the gruesome extent of februarys killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan  about  men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the fouryear war over nagorny karabakh

the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press

diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates

the  february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their fouryear campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday

the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians

the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku

later it was blurred by armenian denials and griefstricken azerbaijans wild and contradictory allegations of up to  dead

the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster said his figure of  people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings

a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali

an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may   dead people named and more than  bodies reported unidentified

this figure of nearly  dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence

francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of  bodies received at his mosque from hojali most of them civilians

we did not count the bodies

but the figure seems reasonable

it is no fantasy mr zen ruffinen said

we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead

mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre

dont get worked up

it will take several months to get a final figure the yearold lawyer said at his small office

mr rasulov knows about these things

it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that  people were killed and  wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january 

those nationalists the popular front finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about  miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians

officially  people have so far been certified as dead being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republics forensic department

this is just a small percentage of the dead said rafiq youssifov the republics chief forensic scientist

they were the only bodies brought to us

remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within  hours

of these  people  were women and  were children under  years old

gunshots killed  people shrapnel killed  and axes or blunt instruments killed 

exposure in the highland snows killed the last three

thirtythree people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifovs report

those  bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed mr rasulov said

files from mr rasulovs investigative commission are still disorganised  lists of  azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of  corpses brought to be washed in just one day

the most heartbreaking account from  witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on  february

there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly  in hojali  people by the stream and the road and  visible around nakhchivanik village mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot

people waved up to us for help

we saw three dead children and one twoyearold alive by one dead woman

the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up

we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return

there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time  many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces

the independent london  serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

first nagarnokarabagh was armenians homeland today he fizuli lacin and several villages in azerbadjan he are their homeland

cant you see the he the great armenia dream in this

greater armenia would stretch from karabakh to the black sea to the mediterranean so if you use the term greater armenia use it with care

he with facist methods like he killing raping and bombing villages

the last move was the he blast of a truck with  kurdish refugees trying to he escape the from lacin a city that was given to the kurds he by the armenians

it has always been up to the azeris to end their announced winning of karabakh by removing the armenians

when the president of azerbaijan elchibey came to power last year he announced he would be be swimming in lake sevan in armeniaxn by july

well he was wrong

if elchibey is going to shell the armenians of karabakh from aghdam his people will pay the price

if elchibey is going to shell karabakh from fizuli his people will pay the price

if elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing armenia from the hills of kelbajar his people will pay the price

it also seems other nonazeri minorities in azerbaijan have understood they are next in line in this process of forced azerification or deportation

just look at the situation with the lezgians

about the kurdswhat kurds

according to the azerbaijani government there are no kurds in azerbaijan

cant they make up their minds

oh i see there are only kurds when the azeris want them to be kurds

and anyway this  kurd refugee story as have other stories are simple fabrications sourced in baku modified in ankara

other examples of this are armenia has no border with iran and the ridiculous story of the intercepting of armenian military conversations as appeared in the new york times supposedly translated by somebody unknown from armenian into azeri turkish submitted by an unnamed special correspondent to the ny times from baku

real accurate

h however i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane h to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one h that happened last summer

turkey searched an american plane h carrying humanitarian aid bound to armenia

h no henrik these turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked

he dont speak about things you dont know  american cargo planes he were heading to armenia

when the turkish authorities he announced that they were going to search these cargo he planes  of these planes returned to its base in germany

he  of these planes were searched in turkey

the content of he of the other  planes

not hard to guess is it

it was sure not he humanitarian aid

your facts in error

shipments of all kinds that have transversed turkey have been either searched rerouted or confiscated

some american planes were searched others were rerouted others were untouched

rail shipments were held up last fall and last winter from entering armenian from turkey for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of armenia

wheat was confiscated other shipments were exchanged with crap and dirt then shipped to armenia

us planes dont have to use turkish air bases

the us uses these bases to bomb iraq

anyway us planes can fly over georgia which they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of turkish chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed anything other than a paranoid turkish military

he search turkish planes

you dont know what you are talking about

he since its content is announced to be weapons

well big mouth ozal said military weapons are being provided to azerbaijan from turkey yet demirel and others say no

no wonder you are so confused

he turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons he to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan he it self not the karabag province

so why search a plane for weapons he since its content is announced to be weapons

you are correct all turkish planes should be simply shot down

nice slow moving air transports

  first this man promotes the dissolution of the jews through an intermarriage process and then says that it will be just a bunch of fundamentalist jews who will object

 or does he simply mean to insult the orthodox by using the word fundamentalist

 its irritating when someone mislabels us as fundamentalists isnt it

this sort of thing may help us understand why some muslims rather resent being put under this label

  the comparison of the palestinian situation with the holocaust  is insulting and completely false

any person making such a rude  and false comparison is either ignorant of the holocaust or also  ignorant of the situation in the mideast or is an antisemite

  to compare a complicated political situation with the genocide  of  jews is racist in and of itself

 first of all i never said the holocaust

i said before the holocaust

im not ignorant of the holocaust and know more about nazi germany than most people maybe including you

what i resent is ignorant statements that call people names when they disagree with your position

opposing the atrocities commited by the israeli governement hardly qualifies as antisemitism

if you think name calling is a valid form of argument in intellectual circles you need to get out more often

i dont think the suffering of some jews during wwii justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government

any attempt to call civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is not appreciated

 if turks in greece were so badly mistreated how come they elected twom not one but two representatives in the greek government

how come they have freeabsolutely free hospitalization and education

adam shostack writes  sam zbib writes  im surprised that you dont consider the acquisition of land by  the jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive  state as a hostile action leading to war

  it was for the purpose of establishing a state not an  exclusive state

if the state was to be exclusive it would not have    arab citizens

 could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed

   and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile  action

when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing  to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce

it  is not a hostile action leading to war

 no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity

palestinians are no exception

perhaps you heard about antitrust in the business world

 since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions

basic antitrust law says that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm

you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori 

clearly the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate

they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews

 the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality

being a multiethnic  multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion

plus they paid fair market value etc

they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy

im not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss

 right now im just going to address this point

when the jewish national fund bought most of its land it didnt buy it from the palestinians themselves because for the most part they were tenant farmers fallahin living on land owned by wealthy arabs in syria and lebanon

the jnf offered a premium deal so the owners took advantage of it

its called commerce

the owners however made no provisions for those who had worked for them basically shafting them by selling the land right out from under them

they are to blame not the jews

from tclockorionoacuciedu tim clock subject re conventional proposales israel  palestinians nntppostinghost orionoacuciedu organization university of california irvine lines  the latest israeli proposal first proposed in february of  contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the wb and gaza the palestinians implemented by negotiations

it states that israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status is agreed upon israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the interim selfgovernment arrangements isga the isga will apply to the palestinian inhabitants of the territories under israeli military administration

the arrangements will not have a territorial application nor will they apply to the israeli population of the territories or to the palestinian inhabitants of jerusalem residual powers not delegated under the isga will be reserved by israel israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects external internal and for the maintenance of public order the organs of the isga will be of an administrativefunctional nature the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and coordination with israel

israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education business tourism labor and social welfare local police local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious affairs

several question do come to mind concerning the success we all hope for in the ongoing negotiation process

these arrangements certainly seem to be essentially a rejection of any palestinian interim selfcontrol

without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible vulnerability can israel reasonably put forward at later points in the negotiating process more relaxed proposals for thisinterim period

how should proposals from either side be altered to temper their maximalist approaches as stated above

how can israeli worries and desire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a very real interim palestinian selfgoverning entity

tim later comment  there seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed

the first is that of israel where there is little trust for arab groups so there is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in exchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc

the second is that of the arab worldpalestinians where there is the demand that these tangible concessions be made by israel without it receiving anything tangible back

given this the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns for its expected concessions

by tangible is meant something that  provides israel with comparable protection from the land it is to give up  in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine will be accountable and held actively not just diplomatically responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens or visitors

 israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go gives lands back to arab states no more buffer zone gives full autonomy to palestinians any andor all of the arab parties could and would if not controlled somehow easily return to the traditional antiisrael position

the question then is how to really ensure that that will not happen

seems to me that a lot of good muslims would care about those terms

especially those affected by the ideology and actions that such terms decscribe

the bosnians suffering from such bigotry comes to mind

they get it from people who call them dirty descendants of turks from people who hate their religion and from those who dont think they are really muslims at all since they are white

the suffering that they are let us not forget about the genocide of the azeri people in karabag and xsoviet armenia by the armenians

between  and  armenians committed unheardof crimes resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism organized massacres poured petrol over babies and burned them raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate

and today they put azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history

aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafebar on the caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of hojali just over three months ago writes hugh pope

im still wearing the same clothes i dont have any others the yearold carpenter said beginning his account of the hojali disaster

i was wounded in five places but i am lucky to be alive

mr sadikov and his wife were short of food without electricity for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for  days

they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the  to  people left in the straggling azeri town on the edge of karabakh

at about pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before eight or nine kinds of weapons artillery heavy machineguns the lot mr sadikov said

soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack

some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town down a hill through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side

to escape the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about  miles away

they thought they were going to make it until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak

none of my group was hurt up to then  then we were spotted by a car on the road and the armenian outposts started opening fire mr sadikov said

azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians but their efforts were mostly in vain

mr sadikov said only  people from his group of  made it through including his wife and militiaman son

seven of his immediate relations died including his yearold elder brother

i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes

we have never got any of the bodies back

the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire

one hero of the evacuation alif hajief was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third groups crossing mr sadikov said

another hero elman memmedov the mayor of hojali said he and several others spent the whole day of  february in the bushy hillside surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay

as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee

the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian rocket attack

some people just kept going mr sadikov said

i had to get to the hospital for treatment

i was in a bad way

they even found a bullet in my sock

i just thought that i would make it clear in case you are not familiar with my past postings on this subject i do not condone attacks on civilians

hezbollah and other lebanese resistance fighters are skilled at precision bombing of sla and israeli targets

i find such methods to be far more restrained and responsible than the israeli method of shelling and bombing villages with the hope that a hezbollah member will be killed along with the civilians murdered

i do not consider the killing of combatants to be murder

soldiers are trained to die for their country

three idf soldiers did their duty the other day

these men need not have died if their government had kept them on israeli soil

is there any israeli a civilian in your opinion 

now i do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages

but you claim these are villages with civilians and iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists

you claim that israelis shell the villages with the hope of finding a terrorist or so

if they kill one fine if not too bad civilians die right 

i am not so sure

as somebody wrote saddam hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner

and he also claimed civilians murdered

let me ask you isnt there at least a slight chance that you not only and the question is very general no insult are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern lebanon 

now a lot people who post here consider israeli soil kind of mediteranean sea

how do you define israeli soil 

from what you say if you do not clearly recognize the state of israel you condone killing israelis anywhere

dorin are you aware that the idf sent helicopters and gunboats up the coast of lebanon the other day and rocketted a palestinian refugee north of beirut

perhaps i should ask you what qualifies a person for murder

 i do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe

if it was to kill civilians i doubt i certainly do not condone it

if civilians were killed i do not condone it

that they are palestinian

that they are children and may grow up to be terrorists

that they are female and may give birth to little terrorists

brad hernlem hernlemchessncsuedu mr hernlem it was you not me who was showing a huge satisfaction for  israelis human beings by most standards dont know about your standards killed

if you ask me those questions i will have no problem answering not with a question as you did  no nobody is qualified candidate for murder nothing justifies murder

i have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements maybe after eliminating all israelis jews 

am i wrong 

now tell me did you also condone saddams scuds on israeli soldiers in lets say tel aviv 

from what i understand a lot of palestineans cheered

what does it show

it does not qualify for freedom fighting to me 

but again i may be wrong and the jewish controlled media distorted the information and i am just an ignorant victim of the media like most of us

dorin

the israeli lefts inability to cope with the challenges it is presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left

we were able to see this clearly during the gulf war

because of the palestinians popular solidarity with iraq yossi sarid  currently minister of the environment  made his infamous statement you look for me  ie iam not making any more efforts to speak with you

from yossi sarids point of view palestinian reality during the gulf war was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it but whether or not the palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party

similarly meretz mk deddi tzuker recently faced with criticism from residents of the west bank town of beit sahour over his governments and his partys lack of action for human rights and peace responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a likud government

from the leftists perspective this is the best government because it is their government regardless of what it does

 these members of the israeli left have already decided how the future of the occupied territories will look and they want to dictate to the palestinians how to get there

when someone starts criticizing the leftists for not being leftist enough we get a pretty clear idea of what they believe to be normal

i hope that your not still calling yourself fair and unbiased elias

so it will be nice if yigal will tell us 

why do american authorities consider yigal arens to be dangerous

 adl authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous including the millions of americans of arab ancestry

perhaps you can answer the question as to why the adl maintained files and spied on adc members in california and elsewhere

friendly rivalry perhaps

 come on

most if not all arabs are sympathetic to the palestinian war against israel

that is why the adl monitors arab organizations

that is the same reason the us monitored communist organizations and soviet nationals only a few years ago

  the adc is an organization of arabamericans

 let me seeyoure saying that most if not all arabamericans should be spied on

youre also saying that most if not all arabamericans should be views as a national security threat to israel and the us as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the wtc bombing in which no arabamericans were involved

by inference can we assume that you think that anyone of arab lineage anywhere in the world poses a threat to israel and therefore should be spied on

like it or not edward anwar has a very good valid point

obviously in presenting it he quite legitimately and deliberately takes a point of view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended but that is one of the best ways to demonstrate a slippery slope type of argument which i believe was his aim

i very frankly believe that the adl will be proved innocent in this case

i doubt theres enough evidence to weigh against them even in a civil court where preponderance of the evidence not evidence beyond any reasonable doubt is the standard for winning such a case

that however does not prevent me from seeing the merit in anwars point

 look mr atakan i have repeated it in the past and i shall repeat it once  more that when it comes to how greeks are treating the turks in greece  you and your copatriots should simply shut up

  because what you are hearing is simply a form of propaganda from your ethnic  fellows who studied at the greek universities without paying any money for  tuition food and helth insurance

  and any high school graduate can put down some simple math and compare the  grouth of the turkish community in greece with the destruction of the greek  minority in turkey

  aykut atalay atakan   panos tamamidis   mr tamamidis   before repling your claims i suggest you be kind to individuals  who are trying to make some points abouts human rights discriminations  and unequal treatment of turkish minority in greecei want the world  know how bad you treat these people

you will deny anything i say but  it does not make any difrence because i will write things that i saw with  my eyesyou prove yourself prejudice by saying free insurance school  etc

do you greeks only give these things to turkish minority or  everybody has rights to get themyour words even discriminate  these people

you think that you are giving big favor to these  people by giving these thing that in reality they get nothing

 if you do not know unhuman practices that are being conducted  by the government of the greece i suggest that you investigate  to see the facts

then we can discuss about the most basic  human rights like fredom of religion if you did not see with your eyes freedom of religion you must ne at least blind 

 fredom of press of turkish  weeks ago i read the interview of a turkish journalist in a greek magazine he said nothing about being forbiden to have turkish press in greece 

 minority ethnic cleansing of all turks in greece give as a brake

you call athnic cleansing of apopulation when it doubles

 freedom of  right to have property without government intervention what do you mean by that 

anyway in greece as in every country if you want some property you inform the goverment 

 fredom of right to vote to choose your community leaders well well well

when turkish in area of komotini elect  out of  represenatives of this area to greek parliament if not freedom what is it

out of  

maybe there are only turks living there   how greek government encourages people to destroy  religious places houses farms schools for turkish minority then  forcing them to go to turkey without anything with them

i cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported

a minority of greek idiots indeed attack religious places which were protected by the greek police

photographs of greek policemen preventing turks from this non brain minority were all over greek press

 before i conclude my writing let me point out how greeks are  treated in turkey

we do not consider them greek minority instead  we consider a part of our society

there is no difference among people in  turkey

we do not state that greek minority go to turkish universities  get free insurance food and health insurance because these are basic  human needs and they are a part of turkish community

all big businesses  belong to greeks in turkey and we are proud to have themunlike the  greece which tries to destroy turkish minority we encourage all  minorities in turkey to be a part of turkish society

oh no

please do give as a brake 

minorities in turkish treated like that 

your own countrymen die in the prisons every day bacause of their political beliefs an this is reported by turks and you want us to believe tha turkey is the paradise of human rights 

business of greeks i turkey

yes  years ago 

you seem to be intelligent so before presenting turkey as the paradise of human rights just invastigate this matter a bit more

  aykut atalay atakan 

 historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited  signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian  populations

even the nazis did this much

is the world community really so powerless

where are all those human rights advocates

where are all the decent people

are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it

the number of azeris murdered by the terrorist armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing

 news reporters make their living by providing stories and there is  so way in hell that they are going to confuse the public with  what is happening in armenia a country that few know of and  risk detracting peoples interest from what is happening in serbia

then you must be living in an alternate universe

where were they

an appeal to mankind during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the soviet union

all humanitarian constitutional human rights guaranteed by the un charter universal declaration of human rights helsinki agreements human problems international forums documents signed by the soviet union  all of them are violated

the ussrs president government bodies do not defend azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace

the  strong army of armenian terrorists with moscows tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against azerbaijan

as a result a part of azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed hundreds of people killed thousands wounded

some  azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the armenian ssr their historical homeland

together with them  russians and  kurds have also been driven out a part of them now settled in azerbaijan

some  turkishmeskhetians lezghins and representatives of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations

one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the armenian extremists destruction of the karabakh scientific experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr

we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance for the honour and dignity of  million azerbaijanis are violated its territory culture and history are trampled its people are shot

there is persistent negative image of azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over the whole world by soviet mass media armenian lobby in the ussr and the united states

one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on azerbaijan

it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the issue of karabakh

hundreds and thousands armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land had their representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan ssr

we are for a united indivisible sovereign azerbaijan we are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in  by one of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic republic  muhammed emin rasulzade

but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new  year reich  the great armenia  by annexing the neighboring lands

the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent

but what about the lives of seven million human beings

if these people are muslims does it mean that they are less valuable

can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or other attributes

all people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding

this is not the first appeal of azerbaijan to the world public opinion

our previous appeals were unheard

however we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins

the committee for peoples help to karabakh of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr  everyone knows this even the turks know this you know this

give  us a time period when the world is currently boring and what is  happening in armenia would make front page headlines

think im lying

 take a look at what happened in somalia

when did the press report  it to the world

but perhaps turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the caucasus in the name of peace and democracy

the armenians are christians the azerbaijanis are moslems and islam is a religion especially unloved by the democratwesternizers

besides at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on azerbaijan a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent azeri people hundreds of thousands of refugees and gross violations of human rights

recently armenians attacked the azeri town of khojaly and massacred thousands of azeris

the parisbased association for democracy and human rights in azerbaijan puts the number of khojali victims at 

some of the dead were scalped and mutilated

this whole thing has now gone entirely too far

 want to know what will bring the story in armenia to the front  page

if the russians move into the area with a shit load of tanks  then your human rights advocates will show up defending the armenians

 of course we can also be sure that the russians wont show up with  any tanks not with the problems they are having at home

they already did

the scenario and genocide staged by the armenians  years ago in the ottoman empire is being reenacted again  this time in azerbaijan

there are remarkable similarities between the plots the perpetrators and the underdogs

report taken from the new york times tuesday march   massacre by armenians being reported agdamazerbaijanmarch  reuters  fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by armenian militants in nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian enclave of azerbaijan

the republic of armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed  people in the azerbaijani populated town of khojaly last week and massacred men women and children fleeing the carnage across snowcovered mountain passes

but dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to azerbaijani reports of a massacre

scalping reported azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off

they said shooting by armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies

women and children have been scalped said assad faradshev an aide to nagornokarabakhs azerbaijani governor

when we began to pick up bodies they began firing at us

the azerbaijani militia chief in agdam rashid mamedov said the bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep

even the fascists did nothing like this

truckloads of bodies near agdam on the outskirts of nagornokarabakh a reuters photographer frederique lengaigne said she had seen two trucks filled with azerbaijani bodies

 what the hell do you know about israeli policy

what gives you the fiat to look into the minds of israeli generals

has this policy of intimidation been published somewhere

for your information the actions taken by arabs specifically the plo were not uncommon in the lebanon campaign of 

my brain is full of shit

at least i dont look into the minds of others and make israeli policy for them

  deleted i am not in the business of reading minds however in this case it would not be necessary

israelis top leaders in the past and present always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the arabs

the way i see it israelis and arabs have not been able to achieve peace after almost  years of fighting because of the following two major reasons  arab governments are not really representative of their people currently most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor dictators

israeli government is arrogant and none comprising

in article cuqimzapollohpcom nelsonpapollohpcom peter nelson writes   btw with bosnias large moslem population why have nations like  turkey saudi arabia syria egypt and others with either money  or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered  to help out bosnia

 obviously you really dont know

 they have spoken out cf secy of state christophers recent trip to the me note the clause more forcibly above

my point is that they have made a few proforma perfunctory remarks and sent in a few cs and so forth but its clearly not something theyre losing much sleep over

theyre just going through the motions while moslems are being ethnically cleansed out of what used to be yugoslavia

the us has been speaking out far more loudly than the moslem nations in the un and other world forums

 besides theres no case that can be made for us military involvement  there that doesnt apply equally well to say liberia angola or  it appears with the khmer rouges new campaign cambodia

nonwhites  dont count

 hmmsome might say kuwaitis are nonwhite

ooops i forgot kuwaitis are oil rich loaded with petrodollars etc so they dont count

precisely

humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification for us involvement in the gulf  oil and geopolitics were

if the the kuwaitis didnt have oil and assuming iraq still saw fit to invade them i doubt you would have seen operation desert storm

 urartuapr organization sdpa

center for regional studies lines  the orders for the turkish extermination of the armenians  to the children of genocide send them away into the desert this is part of a continuing series of articles containing official turkish wartime ww governmental telegrams in translation entailing the orders for the extermination of the armenian people in turkey

generally these telegrams were issued by the turkish minister of the interior talaat pasha for example we have the following set regarding children to the government of aleppo

november  

we are informed that the little ones belonging to the armenians from sivas mamuretulaziz diarbekir and erzeroum hundreds of km distance from aleppo are adopted by certain moslem families and received as servants when they are left alone through the death of their parents

we inform you that you are to collect all such children in your province and send them to the places of deportation and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to the people

minister of the interior talaat  to the government of aleppo

september  

there is no need for an orphanage

it is not the time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans prolonging their lives

send them away to the desert and inform us

minister of the interior talaat  to the general committee for settling and deportees

november  

there were more than four hundred children in the orphanage

they will be added to the caravans and sent to their places of exile

abdullahad nuri

 to the government of aleppo

january  

we hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the armenians

whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose or through contempt of it the government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental

i recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them

minister of the interior talaat

 to the government of aleppo

collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected

send the rest away with the caravans

minister of the interior talaat  from the ministry of the interior to the government of aleppo

at a time when there are thousands of moslem refugees and the widows of shekid fallen soldiers are in need of food and protection it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by armenians who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future

it is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation

those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away in compliance with our previous orders to sivas

minister of the interior talaat  in  halide edip a pioneer turkish nationalist wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with talaat pasha verifying and rationalizing this ultranational fascist antiarmenian mentality the following i have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest and succeeds the world admires it and thinks it moral

i am ready to die for what i have done and i know i shall die for it

 these telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the  trial of talaat pashas assassin soghomon tehlerian

the turkish government never questioned these death march orders until  during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the armenians

for reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial the turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by s orel and s yuca of the turkish historical society

if one were to examine the sample authentic text provided in the turkish historical society study and use their same forgery test on that sample it too would be a forgery

in fact if any of the tests delineated by the turkish historical society are performed an any piece of ottoman turkish or persianarabic script one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery

today the body of talaat pasha lies in a tomb on liberty hill istanbul turkey just next to the yildiz university campus

the body of this genocide architect was returned to turkey from germany during ww when turkey was in a heightened state of protofascism

recently this monument has served as a focal point for antiarmenianism in turkey

this monument represents the epitome of the turkish governments pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born armenian

center for regional studies lines  from quantum magazine marchapril  pages  the problem book of anania of shirak  on the ancient peak of ararat the centuries have come like seconds and passed on

avetik issahakian by yuri danilov some years ago journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them what books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight

and though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from  to  depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes ages and professions not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems

some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for numbers though secretly afraid of them

others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didnt mind saying for all the world to hear that they didnt know how to solve mere arithmetic problems

professional mathematicians were no exception

heres what the russian mathematician alexander khinchin a specialist in statistics wrote about arithmetic i willingly confess that any time a fifthgrader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem it was a hard work for me and sometimes i failed completely

of course like most of my friends i could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route constructing equations or sets of equations

but we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs







by the way its a fact that is well known and oft repeated that as a rule neither high school graduates nor students at teaching colleges nor teachers beginning their careers nor i must add scientific researchers can solve arithmetic problems

it seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifthgrade teachers

now im not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space

but a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the moon but for a extended space voyagesay to venus and back

one for the road they both took out the books they brought for the road

kingsley glanced at the royal astronomers book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers

god knows what this kind of stuff leads to thought kingsley

the royal astronomer looked at kingsleys book and saw the history of herodotus

good lord next hell be reading thucydides thought the royal astronomer

fred hoyle the black cloud the book im talking about isnt very big but its  problems constitute  elegant miniatures from seventhcentury armenia

naive and wise at the same time rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of armenian architecture the church on the island of akhtamar in lake van in what is now turkey

they are as inseparable from the image of armenia as the elegant letters of the armenian alphabet invented by mesrop mashtots or the songs of komitas or the paintings of saryan

an edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity

it was published under the title problems and solutions of vardapet  anania of shirak armenian mathematician of the seventh century translated and published by i

a orbeli petrograd 

the abundance of close observations and wideranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when anania of shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book

for many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanitiesspecialists in armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldnt let just anyone see it

even now after research by k p patkanov the learned monk father kaloust ji

orbeli a abramyan v k chaloyan and others has brought the works of anania of shirak to light in scholarly circles the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book

vardapet anania of shirak once fell in love with the art of calculation i thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number considering it the mother of all wisdom

anania of shirak among ancient armenian thinkers vardapet anania of shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work

some of his works have been preserved

in addition to the problems and solutions the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars on weights and measures cosmography and calendrical theory and armenian geography of the seventh century ad the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient armenia movses of khoren

in his autobiography anania of shirak has this to say about himself i anania of shirak having studied all the science of our armenian land and having learned the holy scripture intimately in the expression of the psalmist every day i illuminated the eyes of my mind

feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation i came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy the mother of all sciences without number

i could find in armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences

i therefore went to greece and met in theodosiople a man named iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works

he told me that in forth armenia  there lived a famous mathematician christosatur

i went this person and spent six months with him

but soon i noticed that christosatur was a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary facts

i then went to constantinople where i met acquaintances who told me why did you go so far when much closer to us in trebizon on the coast of pontus  lives the byzantine vardapet tyukhik

he is full of wisdom is known to kings and knows armenian literature

i asked them how they knew this

they answered we saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man

indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of constantinople philagrus traveled with us bringing many young persons to become pupils of tyukhik

when i heard this i expressed my gratitude to god who had quenched the thirst of his slave

i went to tyukhik at the monastery of st eugene and explained why i had come

he received me graciously and said i praise our lord that he sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of st gregory i am glad that all your country will learn from me

i myself lived in armenia for many years as a youth

ignorance reigned there

vardapet tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me

the lord bestowed upon me his blessing i completely assimilated the science of number and with such success that my fellow students at the kings court began to envy me

i spent eight years with tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language

for the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books secret and explicit ecclesiastical and pagan books on art history and medicine books of chronologies

why enumerate them by title

in a word there is no book that tyukhik did not have

and he had such a gift from the holy spirit for translating that when he sat down to translate something from the greek into armenian he did not struggle as other translators did and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally

tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the armenian language

when i was young he said i lived in trebizon at the court of the military chief ioannus patricus and for a long time up to the accession of mauritius to the throne i served as a military man in armenia and learned your language and literature

during one attack by persian troops on the greeks i was wounded and escaped to antioch

i lost all my possessions

praying to the lord to heal my wounds i made a promise if you prolong my life i shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge

and the lord heard my prayers

after i recovered i went to jerusalem and from there to alexandria and rome

upon returning to constantinople i met a famous philosopher from athens and studied with him for many years

after that i returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people

after some years that philosopher died

not finding a replacement for him the king and his courtiers sent for tyukhik and invited him to assume the teachers position

tyukhik citing the promise he made to god not to move far from the city turned down the offer

but because of his wide leaning people came streaming from all countries to study with him

and i the most insignificant of all armenians having learned from him this powerful science desired by kings brought it to our country supported by no one obligated only to my own industry gods help and the prayers of the blessed educator

and no one thanked me for my efforts

problems and solutions a half and one sixth and one nineninth of all the books were printed on verge one fifth and one twohundredeightyfifthon rag paper one fortyfifth and one eighthundredfiftyfifthon vellum and fortyfive inscribed copieson dutch paper

and so find how many copies were printed in all

imitation of anania of shirak a latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli books have their own fate

the fate of problems and solutions by anania of shirak is quite amazing

the manuscripts of ananias book were preserved only because according to armenian historians in ancient and medieval armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders like weapons and cherished like ones own children

biding their time the manuscripts lay in the matenadaran a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts now the mesrop mashtots institute of ancient manuscripts

and its hour finally arrived

in  the learned monk father kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book supplementing it with an introduction and commentary

in  the book was translated into russian edited annotated and typeset by iosef orbeli a prominent scholar and later a member of the academy of sciences of the ussr

in the translators words the problems of anania are amusing full of life and simple

orbeli goes on to say the subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life

the scene is predominantly his homeland shirak and the surrounding countryside and the dramatis personae if they are named are the local princesthe kamsarakans including nersekh who was a contemporary of anania

like other ancient authors anania of shirak used only aliquots  that is fractions with a numerator of 

when it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than  one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots see the epigraph above

like any true work of art the problems of anania suffer terribly in the retelling

you have to read the originals albeit in translation in their full glory

so lets open ananias problem booka gift from across the ages

problems  and  relate to the armenian uprising against the persians in ad 

problem  my father told me the following story

during the famous wars between the armenians and the persians prince zaurak kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds

three times in a single month he attacked the persian troops

the first time he struck down half of the persian army

the second time pursuing the persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers

the third time he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army

the persians who were still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to nakhichevan

and so from this remainder find how many persian soldiers there were before the massacre

problem  during the famous armenian uprising against the persians when zaurak kamsarakan killed suren one of the armenian azats sent an envoy to the persian king to report the baleful news

the envoy covered fifty miles in a day

fifteen days later when he learned of this zaurak kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back

the riders covered eighty miles in a day

and so find how many days it took them to catch the envoy

problem  mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal

in the russian translation they are all called dishes

but in the original armenian according to orbelis note the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur and in the third instance scutel

scutel is a common armenian word but mesur had not been encountered in armenian literature before ananias problems and solutions

problem  there was a tray in my house

i melted it down and made other vessels from the metal

from one third i made a mesur from one fourth another mesur from one fifth two goblets from one sixth two scutels and from two hundred ten drams i made a bowl

and now find the weight of the tray

several of the problems reflect the richness of the caucasian fauna in ananias time  for instance problem 

problem  once i was in marmet the capital of the kamsarakans

strolling along the bank of the river akhuryan i saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast

we caught a half and a quarter of the school and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel

when i looked in the creel i found fortyfive fishes

and now find how many fishes here were in all

the temptation is great to present all  problems

but ill restrain myself and offer you just one more

problem  provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books

the wild donkey according to the generally accepted view never roamed the armenian lands

yet anania of shirak offers evidence to the contrary 

problem  the hunting preserve of nersekh kamsarakan ter of shirak and asharunik was at the base of the mountain called artin

one night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve

the hunters could not cope with the donkeys and running to the village of talin told nersekh about them

when he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve they began killing the wild beasts

half of the animals were caught in traps one fourth were killed by arrows

the young which constituted one twelfth of all the animals were caught alive and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears

and so find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre

set in type by me iosef orbeli his biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a bibliography

k uzbashyan academician iosef abgarovich orbeli anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy n of the small printingn is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section of the russian translation of anania of shiraks problems and solutions a thin book with yellowed pages has probably noticed the variety of the fonts the elegance of the borders and the high quality of the design printing and binding

such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking

and this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it

an advertisement at the end of the book reads this book was typeset in december  at the printing offices of the russian academy of sciences by me iosef orbeli the text was also proofread laid out and decorated with borders by me

various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end the final pages of the book were typeset by m strolman

typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist iosef orbeli who later became the director of the hermitage museum in leningrad

he was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith

orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house typis academiae founded in  and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters

in preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of armenian churches orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures

this complicated work was done by m g strolman

unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of leningrad in world war ii

when orbeli came to the printing offices of the academy of sciences times were hard

the only way to publish the newly translated problems of anania was for orbeli to learn typesetting he had always been attracted to the printers craft

in  orbeli became the director of printing at the academy of sciences

even after he retired he remained a tireless champion of russian academic typography

back to earth this book by definition does not exhaust all the most important works in this domain

the editor hopes that those who are guilty of this incompleteness will read these lines and stung by shame will work up if not a collection like this at least a monograph

maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of quantum and another looking over her shoulder will read this article and say to himself this anania from shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy

when i get home ill try to find his problems

good luck my young friend

anania is sure to entertain you

perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless problems and solutions

and we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by iosef orbeli

 vardapet or vartabed means teacher or learned man in armenian

the armenian language suffers in english from a dual transliteration scheme

thus mesrop is often rendered as mesrob komitas as gomidas and so on

 fourth armenia was one of fifteen provinces into which according to armenian geography in the seventh century ad socalled great armenia was divided

 pontus or pontus euxinus was an old name for the black sea

 azats were members one of several strata of freemen in ancient armenia

 ter was the title of the heads of sovereign royal families in ancient armenia

she is simply letting the world henrik know that she will no longer sit there quiet and let turks get henrik away with their famous tricks

armenians do remember of the turkish henrik invasion of the greek island of cypress while the world simply watched

esin terzioglu your ignorance is obvious from your posting

esin terzioglu  cyprus was an independent country with turkishgreek inhabitants not a greek island like your ignorant posting claims esin terzioglu  the name should be cyprus in english esin terzioglu next time read and learn before you post

aside from spelling  why is that you turks do not want to admit your past mistakes 

you know turkish invasion of cyprus was a mistake and too bad that un did not do anything about it

you may ask  mistake 

yes i would say

why is that the greeks did not invade cyprus 

my response to the shooting down of a turkish airplane over the armenian air space was because of the ignorant posting of the person from your country

turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the karabakh conflict with azerbaijan

the karabakhiarmenians who have lived in their homeland for  years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are the ones directly involved in the conflict

they are defending themselves against azeri aggression

agression that has no mercy for inocent people that are costantly shelled with migs and othe russian aircraft

at last i hope that the us insists that turkey stay out of the karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never occur again

 just a couple of questions for the proisraeli lobby out there    is israels occupation of southern lebanon temporary

for mr  stein i am working on a proof for you that israel is diverting  water to the jordan river away from lebanese territory

yes it is as has been evidenced by the previous two stages of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops

currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light and armored patrols

no permanent installations have been built in the area nor are any planned

as to the prodigal water question you can continue to waste your time looking for nonexistent proof or you can accept the testimony of people here some lebanese who have acknowledged that they know of no evidence for these allegations

  is israels occupation of the west bank gaza and golan  temporary

if so for those of you who support it why were so  many settlers moved into the territories

if it is not temporary  lets hear it

it depends which of those territories you refer to

in general settlers were moved into the territories because at the time in the context of the situations it seemed the logical move

this is not to say that views dont change or that mistakes are not made

currently i would say that the only disputed territory that does not appear to be temporary is that of eastern and northern jerusalem

da armenia is involved in fighting with azarbaijan

it is armenian da soldiers from mainland armenia that are shelling towns in azarbaijan

well this is your opinion 

turkish azeris can bark all they want since the above is untrue

however i am sure you guys would have never brought up armenias involvement if karabakhiarmenians had had heavy losses

da you might wish to read more about whether or not it is azeri aggression da only in that region

it seems to me that the armenians are better da organized have more success militarily and shell azeri towns da repeatedly

read what 

the new york times  that is publishing antiarmenian articles

nop i have my resources

look everyone knows how aggressive turksazeris have been in the past

armenians are not gona sit around and watch fire works by azeris taught by turks

da it seems to me that the armenians are better organized have more success da militarily and shell azeri towns repeatedly

buch of nonsence crap and you know it

who the hell you think you are talking to 

azeris are fighting local armenians in nagarnokarabakh

you tell me who has more migs 

freedom fighters in nagarnokarabakh or azerbaijan 

again i will say it for the last time armenia is not involved in this war and you guys want to bring this up in order to cover up the turkish involvment in the karabakh

go ahead  repeat as much as you want

da i dont wish to get into the cyprus discussion

turkey had the right to da intervene and it did

perhaps the intervention was not supposed to da last for so long but the constant refusal of the greek governments both da on the island and in greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed da for the ongoing standoff in the region

not a chance 

you can not convince me based on your reasonsthat your government did the right thing to invade cyprus

da lastly why is there not a socculturearmenia

one has to read mr salahs posters in which he decribes jews as sons of pigs and monkeys keeps promising the final battle between muslims and jews in which the stons and the trees will cry for the muslims to come and kill the jews hiding behind them makes jokes about jews dying from heart attacks etc to realize his objective stance on the matters involved

humanist or subhumanist

 so steve lets here what is zionism

 assuming that you mean hear you werent listening he just  told you zionism is racism

this is a tautological statement

i think you are confusing tautological with false and misleading

stuff deleted  country

turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the  karabakh conflict with azerbaijan

gimme a break

capital letters or not the above is pure nonsense

it seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities while hoping that turkey will stay out

stop and think for a moment will you

armenia doesnt need anyone to drag her into the conflict it is a part of it

the karabakhiarmenians who have lived in their homeland for  years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are the ones directly involved in the conflict

they are defending themselves against azeri aggression

huh

you didnt expect azeris to be friendly to forces fighting with them within their borders

  at last i hope that the us insists that turkey stay out of the karabakh  crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never occur again

youre not playing with a full deck are you

where would turkey invade

are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with scg

in the header in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun

yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table

thats hard to do when armenians are attacking azeri towns

armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis thats going to cause incessant skirmishes

think of  or  years down the line  both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out

these people will be neighbors would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal

if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future

its easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled

the armenians in armenia and nk will be there with the same people you seem to hate as their neighbors for maybe  years more

the sooner theres peace in the region the better it is for them and everyone else

id push for compromise if i were you instead of hitting the capslock and spreading inflammatory halftruths

cheers bm

from cprigcapcorg center for policy research subject re from israeli press

madness

lines  nfid rcdpcdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    before getting excited and implying that i am posting fabrications i would suggest the readers to consult the newspaper in question

tahnks elias

  from center for policy research cpr  subject ten questions about israel    ten questions to israelis     i would be thankful if any of you who live in israel could help to  provide  accurate answers to the following specific questions

these are  indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by  people around me

  

is it true that the israeli authorities dont recognize  israeli nationality 

and that id cards which israeli citizens  must carry at all times identify people as jews or arabs not as  israelis 

thats true

israeli id cards do not identify people as israelies

smart huh

 

is it true that israeli stocks nuclear weapons 

if so  could you provide any evidence 

yes

theres one warhead in my parents backyard in beer sheva thats only some  miles from dimona you know

evidence

i saw it

 

is it true that in israeli prisons there are a number of  individuals which were tried in secret and for which their  identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are  state secrets 

yes

but unfortunately i cant give you more details

thats secret you see

   thanks   elias davidsson iceland email eliasismenntis youre welcome

now let me ask you a few questions if you dont mind 

is it true that the center for policy research is a oneman enterprise



is it true that your questions are not being asked bona fide



is it true that your statement above these are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me is not true

noam

 its curious that serdar spend his time attacking greeks and armenians

who just happen to be historical opponents of turkey

the because the xsoviet armenian government got away with the genocide of 

million turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide

and they are doing it again

are you so blind

problem is everybody  arab greek bulgar serb russian tartar circassian persian kurd  is or has been an opponent

who has been kurds r us armenians r not

an ally

this historic circumstance seems to have taken a certain toll on serdar perhaps he should be posting to altravingnationalist rather than sochistory

excuse me

we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination

our troops surrounded village after village

little resistance was offered

our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work

some of the tartars escaped of course

they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey

the rest were killed

and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages

they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead

ohanus appressian men are like that p 

a genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a race

this is the worst crime in history

it happened to the turks in eastern anatolia and the armenian dictatorship



million turks and kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable

it is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions but there is no denying the fact that the armenian genocide of 

million muslims happened

people of turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the turkish genocide

i understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the turkish genocide indeed took place despite the fact that the genocide of 

million turks has been well documented over the past six decades

we cannot reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the atlantic so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race

source bristol papers general correspondence container   bristol to bradley letter of september  

i have it from absolute firsthand information that the armenians in the caucasus attacked tartar turkish villages that are utterly defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants pillage the village and often burn the village

 lets get somethings straight

why not



armenians are no angels but they were subject to turkish genocide

and the germans were subject to jewish genocide

are you for real

tell me halsall were you high on asalasdpaarf forgeries and fabrications when you wrote that

where is your nonexistent list of scholars

here is mine during the first world war and the ensuing years   the armenian dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuriesold policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering 

million muslims and deporting the rest from their  year homeland

the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the th century acted upon an entire people

this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government and international political leaders such as us

so the list goes on and on and on now wait there is more

mark alan epstein the ottoman jewish communities and their role in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries klaus schwarz werlag freiburg 

page  during the fifteenth century when the ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the balkans there was considerable turmoil among the jewish communities in central and western europe

even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which ottoman life particularly when compared to life in europe held for the jews

there is no way to tell how many jews left christendom for the realm of the rising muslim ottomans but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from christian countries it is recorded that some jews fled to ottoman territory

the regularity of these reports suggests that the ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of jewish families moving southward and eastward from western and central europe



it is evident that the effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and persecution of jews in christian europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of jewish life which for more than two centuries was to be oriented toward muslim east page  in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community was rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city

he was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the edirne jewry in the fifteenth century

sarfati himself was from christian europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the ottoman jews prevailed upon him to write their european coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate

this remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the ottoman domains but described as well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there  page  the impression gained from the hebrew sources is that the jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the christians of europe

confirmation of the commonality of interests between muslims and jews is also indicated by the fact that european christians perceived the jews as allies of islam and were well aware of muslimjewish cooperation

certainly the activity of important jewish financiers and politicians representing the ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed

european sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers

in addition it appears that christian pirates plundered turks and jews their sworn enemies and that europeans considered the jews to be agents who regularly reported to the ottomans

there are wellknown examples of overt jewish support for the ottomans in the struggle against european powers

the two best known instances of jewish support for the campaigning ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the jewish contributions to the conquests of buda in the early sixteenth century and of rhodes

we also have reports of sympathy for the ottomans during the siege of chios

an unpublished ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some greek towns page  it is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of jews and muslims coincided frequently and all parties involved jews muslims and christians were aware of the situation page  it seems that the relations between greeks and jews were not particularly cordial

the two groups had little in common few common interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than enmity

if there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was that between muslims and jews neither of whom had much in common with the orthodox page  the general impression of muslimjewish relations in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests

from the earliest times the ottomans seem to have welcomed jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element

the jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of jews from christian countries to ottoman domains page  from the period before  we have only a few indications that the ottomanjewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the ottomans in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantines and the protection and the security which the ottomans offered in comparison to conditions elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the ottomans and the jews recognized their mutual interests page  it is impossible to say how fundamental the jews were in the success of the ottomans in rebuilding istanbul or in ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century

that they played an important role in both cannot be doupted

it is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the ottomans as well as did the jews

it is however unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between jews and the nonjewish society in which they lived

we must conclude that the ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the jews did

certainly for the jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ottoman empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home  a version of rabbi sarfatis tzarfati letter is given by profshaw page  your cries and sobs reached us

we have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the german landsi hear the lamentation of my brethrenthe barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen peoplethe priests and prelates of rome have risen

they wish to root out the memory of jacob and erase the name of israel

they always devise new persecutions

they wish to bring you to the stakelisten my brethren to the counsel i will give you

i too was born in germany and studied torah with the german rabbis

i was driven out of my native country and came to the turkish land which is blessed by god and filled with all good things

here i found rest and happiness turkey can also become for you the land of peaceif you who live in germany knew even a tenth of what god has blessed us with in this land you would not consider any difficulties you would set out to come to ushere in the land of the turks we have nothing to complain of

we possess great fortunes much gold and silver in our hands

we are not oppressed with heavy taxes and our commerce is free and unhindered

rich are the fruits of the earth

everything is cheap and every one of us lives in peace and freedom

here the jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame as is the case in germany where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him to rob him of his gold

arise my brethren gird up your loins collect your forces and come to us

here you will be free of your enemies here you will find rest  israel zinberg a history of jewish literature

 gochnak armenian newspaper published in the united states may  

source adventures in the near east by a rawlinson jonathan cape  bedford square london  first published   pages

memoirs of a british officer who witnessed the armenian genocide of 

million muslim people p  first paragraph in those moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for arms by the armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such search and not only had many moslems been killed but horrible tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where valuables had been hidden of which the armenians were aware of the existence although they had been unable to find them

p  first paragraph the arrival of this british brigade was followed by the announcement that kars province had been allotted by the supreme council of the allies to the armenians and that announcement having been made the british troops were then completely withdrawn and armenian occupation commenced

hence all the trouble for the armenians at once commenced the wholesale robbery and persecution of the muslem population on the pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms

in the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able to carry out their purpose and the manner in which this was done will be referred to in due course

   nehzate aazaadees member have many times been arrested  and tortured and as we speak some of them are still in prison

   the above item confirms the long standing suspicion that  the only reason this regime has not destroyed nehzate  aazaadee completely is just to show off and brag about the  freedom of expression in iran in its propaganda paper

  get serious

if this regime had its way there would be  absolutely no freedom of expression anywhere not even in sci

 there really isnt as seen by the heavy usage of anonymous posting

if iri sympathizers didnt roam around in sci anonposter would get used only occasionally as in the good old days

  in article igcapcorg cprigcapcorg center for policy research writes     

is it true that in israeli prisons there are a number of   individuals which were tried in secret and for which their   identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are   state secrets 

   apart from mordechai vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there  was one other espionage case the nutty professor at the nes ziona  biological institute who was a kgb

mole who was tried in camera

 i wouldnt exactly call it a state secret

the trial was simply tried  behind closed doors

i hate to disappoint you but the united states  has tried a number of espionage cases in camera

at issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy

this was appraently attempted in the case of vanunu and failed

it has happened before and there is reason to believe it still goes on

read this from maariv february  possibly   publication ban the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public

by baruch meiri all those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way or another look the subject is too delicate

if i comment on it i will be implicitly admitting that it is true if i mention a specific case even hint at it i might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published

the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public

more precisely a court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment

in israel of  citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of this country knowing anything about it

not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison for security offenses in complete secrecy

in the distant past  for example during the days of the lavon  ya affair  we heard about the third man being in prison

but many years have passed since then and what existed then can today no longer be found even in south american countries or in the former communist countries

but it appears that this is still possible in israel of 

the chair of the knesset committee on law the constitution and justice mk david zucker sent a letter on this subject early this week to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor

maariv has obtained the content of the letter during the past several years a number of israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses

in some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment

in those cases after being legally convicted the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner asserts mk zucker

on the other hand zucker agrees in his letter that there is absolutely no question that it is possible and in some cases it is imperative that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials

but even in such cases the court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public

however one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a persons arrest and on the name of a person sentenced to prison is justified and appropriate in the state of israel

the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison

zucker thus decided to turn to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question

the state of israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment

the state of israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret wrote zucker

the legal counsel of the civil rights union attorney mordechai shiffman said that we as the civil rights union do not know of any cases of security prisoners citizens of israel who are imprisoned and whose imprisonment cannot be made public

this is a situation which if it actually exists is definitely unhealthy

just like censorship is an unhealthy matter

the union is aware says shiffman of cases where notification of a suspects arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld

i am speaking only of several days

i know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney  sometimes for the whole first month of arrest

that is done because of the great secrecy

the suspect himself his family his lawyer  or even a journalist  can challenge the publication ban in court

but there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity

the journalist knows nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone is happy attorney yossi arnon an official of the bar claims that given the laws as they exist in israel today a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible

nothing is easier

the court orders a publication ban and thats that

someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it

do you find this situation acceptable

attorney arnon definitely not

we live in a democratic country and such a state of affairs is impermissible

i am well aware that publication can be damaging  from the standpoint of security  but total nonpublication silence is unacceptable

consider the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to  years in prison

the trial was held behind closed doors nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to

it is somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reasons but as i have noted we at least are aware of his imprisonment

why is the matter actually that serious

cant we trust the discretion of the court

attorney arnon the judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them

the judges do not have the tools to investigate

this gives the government enormous power power which they can misuse

and what if there really is a security issue

attorney arnon i am a man of the legal system not a security expert

democracy stands in opposition to security

i believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges  without entering into detail

we have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused in the case of the rachel heller murder

a suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public

attorney shiffman on the other hand believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspects arrest or of a convicted criminals imprisonment

a healthy situation

definitely not

but i am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security

a different opinion is expressed by attorney uri shtendal former advisor for arab affairs to prime ministers levi eshkol and golda meir

clearly we are speaking of isolated special cases

such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public

no doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression

definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication

nevertheless adds shtendal the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles ive mentioned

the authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the prime minister or the security services but with the court which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt

nevertheless attorney shtendal agrees as a rule clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable

such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances

washington upi  secretary of state warren christopher said tuesday there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the balkans than ordering american fighters to bomb the serbs but a frustrated senator told him to do just that

weve not done a damn thing sen joseph biden ddel told christopher at a hearing of the senate foreign relations committee

preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in bosnia herzegovina

biden chastised the administration and its republican predecessor for what he characterized as a limp response to the serbian policy of ethnic cleansing of muslims including rape and shelling of civilians

the time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact that all the options are bad ones biden said

they are all bad ones and we ought to pick a couple

biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the former yugoslavia so the muslimdominated bosnian government might have a chance to at least defend itself against the serbs

christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to  the radical islamic government of iran

o i c

biden endorsed bombing serbian heavy weapons around the besieged eastern town of srebrenica

theres not a military personwho will not tell you that they could today if you gave them the order take out the heavy weaponry around srebrenica biden said

if you did nothing else nothing else but that you would have saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred right now

military action is the only thing thats going to change the equation biden said



despite the frustrations and pressure christopher had no enthusiasm for american combat aircraft to strike serb positions in bosnia herzegovina

  clearly we are at a turning point in the bosnia situation christopher said

air strikes are among those steps that are so complex because they tend to interfere with the humanitarian endeavours

i think there may be better options

humanitarian as in feeding them and let them get raped and killed

political conflict

clinton vowed during the presidential campaign to then lift the arms embargo and to strike at serbian heavy weapons with us combat aircraft

 christopher said airstrikes would likely increase the level of now fighting and cause our allies to draw back or even pull out the humanitarian effort

 great britain and france have balked at foreign military intervention in bosniaherzegovina for fear that their peacekeeping troops on the ground may suffer serbian retribution

why dont they get the hell out of there they ared doing nothing to protect the victims anyway maybe becasue they have a different agenda

 sen nancy kassebaum rkan seemed to agree with christophers  assessment and stressed the need not to build up bosnian expectations for heavy us military intervention

 its very important that expectations arent raised high on the part of the beleagured bosnians she said

 air strikes might have made a difference eight months ago she said but the strategic significance of that step now is questionable

like christopher kassebaum said it might jeopardize the humanitarian relief effort

now that they made sure the bosnian who were the only real subject of the embargo last year as everybody knows that the serbs had an unlimited supply of arms wre massacred without having a chance to defend themselves now this evil coldhearted snake is saying it is too late to save them so let them die

from dbdurartusdpaorg david davidian subject accounts of antiarmenian human right violations in azerbaijan  b summary part b organization sdpa

center for regional studies lines  accounts of antiarmenian human right violations in azerbaijan  part b prelude to current events in nagornokarabakh part b of      oh yes i just remembered

while they were raping me they   repeated quite frequently let the armenian women have babies   for us muslim babies let them bear azerbaijanis for the   struggle against the armenians

then they said those   muslims can carry on our holy cause

heroes

they repeated   it very often

    continued from part a the six of them left

they left and i had an attack

i realized that the dan ger was past and stopped controlling myself

i relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt

my heart and kidneys hurt

i had an awful kidney attack

i rolled back and forth on top of those christmas ornaments howling and howling

i didnt know where i was or how long this went on

when we figured out the time later it turned out that i howled and was in pain for around an hour

then all my strength was gone and i burst into tears i started feeling sorry for myself and so on and so forth 





then someone came into the room

i think i hear someone calling my name

i want to respond and restrain myself i think that im hallucinating

i am silent and then it continues it seems that first a mans voice is calling me then a womans

later i found out that mamma had sent our neighbor the one whose apartment she was hiding in uncle sabir kasumov to our place telling him i know that theyve killed lyuda

go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they dont violate her corpse

he went and returned empty handed but mamma thought he just didnt want to carry the corpse into his apartment

she sent him another time and then sent his wife and they were walking through the rooms looking for me but i didnt answer their calls

there was no light they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps

they started the pogrom in our apartment around five oclock and at  i went down to the kasumovs

i went down the stairs myself

i walked out of the apartment how long can you wait for your own death how long can you be cowardly afraid

come what will

i walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next

no one not on the fifth floor not on the fourth opened the door

on the third floor on the landing of the stairway uncle sabirs son started to shout aunt roza dont cry lyudas alive

he knocked on his own door and out came aunt tanya igor and after them mamma

aunt tanya uncle sabirs wife is an urdmurt

all of us were in their apartment

i didnt see karina but she was in their home too lying delirious she had a fever

marina was there too and my father and mother

all of my family had gathered there

at the door i lost consciousness

igor and aunt tanya carried me into the apartment

later i found out what they had done to our karina

mamma said lyuda karinas in really serious condition shes probably dying

if she recognizes you dont cry dont tell her that her face looks so awful

it was as though her whole face was paralyzed you know everything was pushed over to one side her eye was all swollen and everything flowed together her lips her cheeks 





it was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict thats how disfigured her face was

i said fine

mamma was afraid to go into the room because she went in and hugged karina and started to cry

i went in

as soon as i saw her my legs gave way

i fell down near the bed hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying

she opened the eye that was intact looked at me and said who is it

but i could barely talk my whole face was so badly beaten

i didnt say but rather muttered something tender something incomprehensible but tender my karochka my karina my little golden one 





she understood me

then igor brought me some water i drank it down and moistened karinas lips

she started to groan

she was saying something to me but i couldnt understand it

then i made out it hurts i hurt all over

her hair was glued down with blood

i stroked her forehead her head she had grit on her forehead and on her lips 





she was groaning again and i dont know how to help her

she calls me over with her hand come closer

i go to her

shes saying something to me but i cant understand her

igor brings her a pencil and paper and says write it down

she shakes her head as if to say no i cant write

i cant understand what shes saying

she wanted to tell me something but she couldnt

i say karina just lie there a little while then maybe youll feel better and you can tell me then

and then she says maybe itll be too late

and i completely 





just broke down i couldnt control myself

then i moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye

i dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips

she says lyuda were not saved yet we have to go somewhere else

out of this damned house

they want to kill us i know

theyll find us here too

we need to call urshan

she repeated this to me for almost a whole hour until i understood her every word

i ask whats his number

urshan feyruzovich thats the head of the administration where she works

we have to call him

but i didnt know his home number

i say karina whats his number

she says i cant remember

i say who knows his number

who can i call

she says i dont know anything leave me alone

i went out of the room

igor stayed to watch over her and sat there he was crying too

i say mamma karina says that we have to call urshan

how can we call him

who knows his telephone number

i tell marina think think who can we call to find out

she started calling several people didnt answer

she called a girlfriend her girlfriend called another girlfriend and found out the number and called us back

the bosss wife answered and said he was at the dacha

my voice keeps cracking i cant talk normally

she says lyuda dont panic get a hold of yourself go out to those hooligans and tell them that they just cant do that

she still didnt know what was really going on

i said its easy for you to say that you dont understand whats happening

they are killing people here

i dont think there is a single armenian left in the building theyve cut them all up

im even surprised that we managed to save ourselves

she says well ok if its that serious 





and all the same shes thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that im fearing for my life that in fact its not all that bad

ok fine fine she says if youre afraid ok as soon as urshan comes back ill send him over

we called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under aunt tanyas on the second floor asya dallakians apartment

she wasnt home she was staying with her daughter in karabagh

they destroyed everything there 





we realized that they still might come back

we kept on trying to get through to aunt tanyaurshans wife is named tanya too and finally we get through

she says yes hes come home hes leaving for your place now

he came

of course he didnt know what was happening either because he brought two of his daughters with him

he came over in his jeep with his two daughters like he was going on an outing

he came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened

he has grown up daughters theyre almost my age

the three of us carried out karina tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf and went down to his car

he took karina and me to the maternity home





no first they took us to the poice precinct

they had stretchers ready

as soon as we got out of the car they put karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustnt move we might have fractures

from the stretcher i saw about  soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor bandaged on the concrete floor groaning 





this was around eleven oclock at night

we had left the house somewhere around 

when i saw those soldiers i realized that a war was going on soldiers enemies 





everything just like a war

they carried me into some office on the stretcher

the emergency medical people from baku were there

the medical attendant there was an older armenian

urshan told him what they had done to karina because shes so proud she would never have told

and this aging armenian 





his name was uncle arkady i think because someone said arkady get an injection ready he started to fill a syringe and turned around so as to give karina a shot

but when he looked at her face he became ill and he was an old man in his sixties his hair was all grey and his moustache too

he hugged karina and started to cry what have they done to you

he was speaking armenian

what have they done to you

karina didnt say anything

mamma came in then and she started to cry too

the man tried to calm her

ill give you a shot

mamma tells him i dont need any shot

where is the government

just what are they doing

look what theyve done to my children

theyre killing people and youre just sitting here

some teacups were standing on the table in there

youre sitting here drinking tea

look what theyve done to my daughters

look what theyve turned them into

they gave her something to drink some heart medicine i think

they gave karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the maternity home immediately

papa and urshan i think even though papa was in bad shape helped carry karina out

when they put her on the stretcher none of the medics got near her

i dont know maybe there werent any orderlies

then they came to me whats the matter with you

their tone was so official that i wrapped myself tighter in the halflength coat

i had a blanket on too an orange one aunt tanyas

i said im fine

uncle arkady came over and was soothing me and then told the doctor you leave let a woman examine her

a woman came an azerbaijani i believe and said whats wrong with you

i was wearing my sister lyudas nightshirt the sister who at this time was in yerevan

when she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby

i tore the night shirt some more and showed her

i took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her

there was a huge wound about the size of a hand on my back from the indian vase

she said something to them and they gave me two shots

she said that it should be dressed with something but that theyd do that in the hospital

they put me on a stretcher too

they started looking for people to carry me

i raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up and this woman i dont know if she was a doctor or a nurse said lie still you mustnt move

when i was lying back down i saw two policemen leading a man

his profile seemed very familiar to me

i shouted stop

one of the policemen turned and says what do you want

i say bring him to me i want to look at him

they brought him over and i said that person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister

i recognize him note it down

they said fine but didnt write it down and led him on

i dont know where they were taking him

then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting

they went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer

one of the soldiers started talking to me sister 





i dont remember the conversation exactly but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us

i asked him where are you from

he said that he was from ufa

apparently they were the first that were brought in

the ufa police

later i learned that they suffered most of all

he says ok youre armenians they didnt get along with you but im a russian he says what are they trying to kill me for

oh i remembered something else

when i went out onto the balcony with kuliyev for a hammer and nails i looked out the window and saw two azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten

he was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms they were beating him with his own club

the way he cried mamma made my skin crawl

i dont know what they did to him if hes still alive or not

and something else

before he attack on our house we saw sheets clothes and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building but i didnt think it was azerbaijanis attacking armenians

i thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didnt need out or someone was fighting with someone

it was only later when they were burning a passenger car in the yard when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the armenians that i realized that this was serious that it was antiarmenian

they took karina and me to the sumgait maternity home

mamma went to them too and said ive been beaten too help me

but they just ignored her

my father went to them and said in a guilty voice as though it was his fault that hed been beaten and says my ribs hurt so much those creeps have probably broken my ribs

please look at them

the doctor says thats not my job

urshan said fine ill take you to my place and if we need a doctor ill find you one

ill bring one and have him look at you

and he drove them to his apartment

marina and i stayed there

they examined us

i was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us

i wasnt surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us but i was very surprised that in a soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the hippocratic oath could talk to victims like that

by happyor unhappy coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our karina

and she having examined karina said no problem you got off pretty good

not like they did in kafan when you armenians were killing and raping our women

karina was in such terrible condition that she couldnt say anythingshe would certainly have had something to say

then they examined me

the same story

they put us in a separate ward

no shots no medicinal powders no drugs

absolutely none

they didnt even give us tea

all the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were armenians who had been raped

and they started coming and peering through the keyhole the way people look at zoo animals

karina didnt see this she was lying there and i kept her from seeing it

they put ira b in our ward

she had also been raped

true she didnt have any serious bodily injuries but when she told me what had happened at their place i felt worse for them than i did for us

because when they raped ira her daughter was in the room she was under the bed on which it happened

and ira was holding her daughters hand the one who was hiding under the bed

when they were beating ira or taking her earrings off gold when she involuntarily let go of her daughters hand her daughter took her hand again

her daughter is in the fourth grade shes  years old

i felt really awful when i heard that

ira asked them not to harm her daughter she said do what you want with me just leave my daughter alone

well they did what they wanted

they threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way

now i would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night

it was simply bartholomews night i say they did what they would love to do every day steal kill rape 





many are surprised that those animals didnt harm the children

the beasts explained it like this this would be repeated in  to  years and those children would be grown and then as they put it well come take the pleasure out of their lives those children

this was about the girls that would be young women in  years

they were thinking about their tomorrow because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation just as there was no trial or investigation in  and that those girls could be of some use in  years

this i heard from the investigators one of the victims testified to it

thats how they described their own natures that they would still be bloodthirsty in  to  years and in  yearsthey themselves said that

and this too

everyone is surprised that they didnt harm our marina

many people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much

i dont know why their eyes were red

maybe because they hadnt slept the night before maybe for some other reason i dont know

but they hadnt been smoking and they werent drunk im positive because someone who has smoked will stop at nothing he has the urge to do

and they spoke in a cultured fashion with marina little sister dont be afraid we wont harm you dont look over there where i was you might be frightened

youre a muslim a muslim woman shouldnt see such things

so they were really quite sober 





so we came out of that story alive

each every day we have lived since it all happened bears the mark of that day

it wasnt even a day of those several hours

father still cant look us in the eyes

he still feels guilty for what happened to karina mother and me

because of his nerves hes started talk ing to himself ive heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening listen hell say what could i do

what could i do alone how could i protect them

i dont know where to find the words its not that im happy but i am glad that he didnt see it all happen

thats the only thing they spared us 





or maybe it happened by chance

of course he knows it all but theres no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened

and there were so many conversations karina and i spoke together in private and we talked with mamma too

but father was never present at those conversations

we spare him that if you can say that

and when the investigator comes to the house we dont speak with father present

on february  the next clay karina and i were discharged from the hospital

first they released me but since martial law had been declared in the city the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier

there were many people there armenian victims

i met the tovmasian family there

from them i learned that rafik and their uncle grant had died

they were sure that both had died

they were talking to me and raya rafiks wife and grants daughter and her mother were both crying

then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard

theres a little oneroom house outside there a recreation and reading area

they took us in there

the women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide

the women were shouting

they explained to them we want to hide you better because its possible there will be an attack on the police precinct

we went into the little house

there were no chairs or tables in there

we had children with us and they were hungry we even had infants who needed to have their diapers changed

no one had anything with them

it was just awful

they kept us there for  hours

from the window of the one room house you could see that there were azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the police precinct as though they were spying on us

the police precinct is surrounded by a wall like a fence and its electrified but if they were standing on the wall it means the electricity was shut off

this brought great psychological pressure to bear on us particularly on those who hadnt just walked out of their apartments but who hadnt slept for  hours or  or those who had suffered physically and spiritually the ones who had lost family members

for us it was another ordeal

we were especially frightened when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared

we couldnt see a single person not in the courtyard and not in the windows

we thought that they must have already been hiding under the building that they must have some secret room down there

people were panicking they started throwing themselves at one another 





thats the way it is on a sinking ship

we heard those people mainly young people whistling and whopping on the walls

we felt that the end was approaching

i was completely terrified i had left karina in the hospital and didnt know where my parents were

i was sort of calm about my parents i was thinking only about karina if heaven forbid they should attack the hospital they would immediately tell them that there was an armenian in there and something terrible would happen to karina again and she wouldnt be able to take it

then soldiers with dogs appeared

when they saw the dogs some of the people climbed down off the fence

then they brought in about another  soldiers

they all had machine guns in readiness their fingers on the triggers

we calmed down a little

they brought us chairs and brought the children some little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands and took the children to the toilet

but we all sat there hungry but to be honest it would never have occurred to any of us that we hadnt eaten for two days and that people do eat

then closer to nightfall they brought a group of detained criminals

they were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs

one of the men came back from the courtyard and told us about it

raya tovmasian 





it was like a different woman had been substituted

earlier she had been crying wailing and calling out oh rafik but when she heard about this such a rage came over her

she jumped up she had a coat on and she started to roll up her sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone

and suddenly there were soldiers and dogs and lots of people

she ran over to them

the bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall

she went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash him

then on to a second and a third

everyone was rooted to the spot

not one of the soldiers moved no one went up to help or made her stop her from doing it

and the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands muttering something

she came back and sat down and something akin to a smile appeared on her face

she became so quiet no tears no cries

then that round was over and she went back to beat them again

she was walking and cursing terribly take that and that they killed my husband the bastards the creeps and so on

then she came back again and sat down

she probably did this the whole night through well it wasnt really night no one slept

she went five or six times and beat them and returned

and she told the women what are you sitting there for

they killed your husbands and children they raped and youre just sitting there

youre sitting and talking as though nothing had happened

arent you armenians

she appealed to everyone but no one got up

i was just numb i didnt have the strength to beat anyone i could barely hold myself up all the more so since i had been standing for so many hoursi was released at eleven oclock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there werent enough chairs really it was the elderly and women with children who sat

i was on my feet the whole time

there was nothing to breathe the door was closed and the men were smoking

the situation was deplorable

at eleven oclock at night policemen came for us local policemen azerbaijanis

they said get up

theyve brought mattresses you can wash up and put the children to bed

now the women didnt want to leave this place either

the place had become like home it was safe there were soldiers with dogs

if anyone went outside the soldiers would say oh its our little family and things like that

the soldiers felt this love and probably for the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders

everyone spoke from the heart cried and hugged them and they with their loaded machine guns in their hands said grandmother you mustnt approach me im on guard

our people would say oh thats all right

they hugged them one woman even kissed one of the machine guns

this was all terribly moving for me

and the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs

they took us up to the second floor and said you can undress and sleep in here

dont be afraid the precinct is on guard and its quiet in the city

this was the th when the killing was going on in block a and in other places

then we were told that all the armenians were being gathered at the sk club and at the city party committee

they took us there

on the way i asked them to stop at the maternity home i wanted to take karina with me

i didnt know what was happening there

they told me dont worry the maternity home is full of soldiers more than motherstobe

so you can rest assured

i say well i wont rest assured regardless because the staff in there is capable of anything

when i arrived at the city party committee it turned out that karina had already been brought there

they had seen fit to release her from the hospi tal deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care

once we were in the city party committee we gave free reign to our tears

we met acquaintances but everyone was somehow divided into two groups those who hadnt been injured who were clothed who had brought a pot of food with them and so on and those like me like raya who were wearing whatever had come their way

there were even people who were all made up dolled up like they had come from a wedding

there were people without shoes naked people hungry people those who were crying and those who had lost someone

and of course the stories and the talk were flying oh i heard that they killed him

what do you mean they killed him

he stayed at work

do you know whats happening at this and such a plant

talk like that

and then i met aleksandr mikhailovich gukasian the teacher

i know him very well and respect him highly

ive known him for a long time

they had a small room well really it was more like a studyroom

we spent a whole night talking in that study once

on march  we heard that bagirov first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr had arrived

everyone ran to see bagirov what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed from outside

he arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask him things

everyone was in a tremendous rage

but he was protected by soldiers and he went up to the second floor and didnt deign to speak with the people

apparently he had more important things to do

several hours passed

gukasian called me and says lyudochka find another two or three

were going to make up lists they asked for them upstairs lists of the dead those whose whereabouts are unknown and lists of people who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned

i had about  people in my list when they called me and said lyuda your mamma has arrived shes looking for you she doesnt believe that you are alive and well and that youre here

i gave the lists to someone and asked them to continue what i was doing and went off

the list was imprecise of course

it included grant adamian raya tovmasians father who was alive but at the time they thought him dead

there was engels grigorians father and aunt cherkez and maria

the list also included the name of my girlfriend and neighbor zhanna agabekian

one of the guys said that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the kosmos movie theater

we put her on the list too and cried but later it turned out that that was just a rumor that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for krasnovodsk where thank god she was alive and well

i should also say that in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead

all the lists were taken to bagirov

i dont remember how many dead were contained in the list but its a fact that when gukasian came in a couple of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate

i asked whats going on

he said lyuda can you imagine what animals what scoundrels they are

they say that they lost the list of the dead

piotr demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr has just arrived and we were supposed to submit the list to him so that hed see the scope of the slaughter of the tragedy whether it was one or fifty

they told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadnt left for the khimik boarding house all over again

there were  people on our second list

i think that the number  was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio because thats the list that demichev got

i remember exactly that there were  people on the list i had even told aleksandr mikhailovich that that was only a half of those that were on the first list

he said lyuda please try to remember at least one more

but i couldnt remember anyone else

but there were more than  dead

of that i am certain

the government and the procuracy dont count the people who died of fright like sick people and old people whose lives are threatened by any shock

they werent registered as victims of the sumgait tragedy

and then there may be people we didnt know

so many people left sumgait between march  and 

most of them left for smaller towns in russia and especially to the northern caucasus to stavropol and the krasnodarsk territory

we dont have any information on them

i know that there are people who set out for parts around moscow

in the periodical krestyanka woman farmer there was a call for people who know how to milk cows and for mechanics and drivers and i know a whole group of people went to help out

also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city who were burned in their cars

no one knows about them except the azerbaijanis who are hardly likely to say anything about it

and theres more

a great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list drawn up at the procuracy

i know of three instances for sure and i of course dont know them all

im thinking of three women whose parents chose not to publicize what had happened that is they didnt take the matter to court they simply left

but in so doing they didnt cease being victims

one of them is the first cousin of my classmate kocharian

she lived in microdistrict no

 on the fifth floor

i cant tell you the building number and i dont know her name

then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives she lived in microdistrict  near the gift shop

i dont know her name she lives on the same landing as the sumgait procurator

they beat her father he was holding the door while his daughter hid but he couldnt hold the door forever and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors they seized her by her braid

like the azerbaijanis were saying it was a very cultured mob because they didnt kill anyone they only raped them and left

and the third one 





i dont remember who the third one was anymore

they transferred us on march 

karina still wasnt herself

yes we lived for days in the sk in the cultural facility and at the khimik

they lived there and i lived at the city party committee because i couldnt stay with karina it was too difficult for me but i was at peace she had survived

i could already walk but really it was honest words that held me up

thanks to the social work i did there i managed to persevere

aleksandr mikhailovich said if it werent for the work i would go insane

he and i put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves someone had an infant and needed diapers and free food and we went to get them

the first days we bought everything although we should have received it for free

they were supposed to have been dispensed free of charge and they sold it to us

then when we found out it was free we went to krayev

at the time fortunately you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces

krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue

on march  they sent two investigators to see us andrei shirokov and vladimir fedorovich bibishev

the way it worked out in our family they had considered only karina and me victims maybe because she and i wound up in the hospital

mother and father are considered witnesses but not victims

shirokov was involved with karinas case and bibishev with mine

after i told him everything he and i planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone i could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind

we didnt work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions werent there

the investigative group worked slowly and did poor quality work solely because the situation wasnt conducive to working there werent enough automobiles especially during the time when there was a curfew and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts and no still or video cameras

i think that this was done on purpose

were not so poor that we cant supply our investigators with all that stuff

it was done especially to draw out the investigation all the more so since the local authorities saw that the armenians were leaving at the speed of light never to return to sumgait

and the armenians had a lot to say i came to an agreement with bibishev i told him myself dont you worry if it takes us a month or two months ill be here

im not afraid i looked death in the eyes five times in those two days ill help you conduct the investigation

he and i worked together a great deal and i used this to shelter karina i gave them so much to do that for a while they didnt have the time to get to her so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her self

she was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x rays

she couldnt eat or drink for nine days she was nauseous

i didnt eat and drank virtually nothing for five days

then on the fifth day when we were in baku already the investigator told me how long can you go on like this

well fine so you dont want to eat you dont love yourself youre not taking care of yourself but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through

we need you

then i started eating because in fact i was exhausted

it wasnt enough that i kept seeing those faces in our apart ment in my mind every day i went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons

i dont know 





we were just everywhere

probably in every prison in the city of baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of sumgait

at that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary confinement

thus far i have identified  of the people who were in our apartment

mamma identified three and karina two

the total is 

marina didnt identify anyone she remembers the faces of two or three but they werent among the photographs of those detained

i told of the neighbor i recognized

the one who went after the axe

he still hasnt been detained hes still on the loose

hes gone and its not clear if he will be found or not

i dont know his first or last name

i know which building he lived in and i know his sisters faces

but hes not in the city

the investigators informed me that even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will continue looking for him

the  people i identified are largely bluecollar workers from various plants without education and of the very lowest level in every respect

mostly their ages range from  to  years there was one who was 

only one of them was a student

he was attending the azerbaijan petroleum and chemical institute in sumgait his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga tor

once thinking that i was an employee and not a victim she said in front of me ill set you up a restaurant worth  rubles and give you  in cash simply for keeping him out of armenia that is to keep him from landing in a prison on armenian soil

theyre all terribly afraid of that because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesnt confess even though we identified him they tell himin order to apply psychological pressurethey say fine dont confess just keep silent

when youre in an armenian prison when they find out who you are theyll take care of you in short order

that somehow gets to them

many give in and start to talk

the investigators and i were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment as an investigative experiment

it was only then that i saw the way they had left our apartment

even without knowing who was in our apartment you could guess

they stole for example all the money and all the valuables but didnt take a single book

they tore them up burned them poured water on them and hacked them with axes

only the materials from the th congress of the communist party of the soviet union and james fenimore coopers last of the mohigans

oh yes lunch was ready we were boiling a chicken and there were lemons for tea on the table

after they had been in our apartment both the chicken and the lemons were gone

thats enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment people who dont even know anything about books

they didnt take a single book but they did take worn clothing food and even the cheapest of the cheap wornout slippers

of those whom i identified four were kafan azerbaijanis living in sumgait

basically the group that went seeking revengelets use their word for itwas joined by people seeking easy gain and thrillseekers

i talked with one of them

he had gray eyes and somehow against the backdrop of all that black i remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes

besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment he was also involved in the murder of tamara mekhtiyeva from building 

she was an older armenian who had recently arrived from georgia she lived alone and did not have anyone in sumgait

i dont know why she had a last name like that maybe she was married to an azerbaijani

i had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice and know nothing about her

i do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an axe

murdering her wasnt enough for them

they hacked her into pieces and threw them into the tub with water

i remember another guy really well too he was also rather fairskinned

you know all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark both their hair and their skin

and in contrast with them in addition to the grey eyed one i remember this one fellow the one l took to be a lezgin

i identified him

as it turned out he was eduard robertovich grigorian born in the city of sumgait and he had been convicted twice

one of our own

how did i remember him

the name rita was tattooed on his left or right hand

i kept thinking is that rita or puma which it would be if you read the word as latin characters instead of cyrillic because the cyrillic t was the one that looks like a latin m when they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back

this was at the confrontation

he swore on every holy book tried to put in an armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion and told me that i was making a mistake and called me dear sister

he said youre wrong how could i an armenian raise my hand against my own an armenian and so on

he spoke so convincingly that even the investigator asked me lyuda are you sure it was he

i told him ill tell you one more identifying mark

if im wrong i shall apologize and say i was mistaken

the name rita is tattooed on his left or right hand

he went rigid and became pale

they told him put your hands on the table

he put his hands on the table with the palms up

i said now turn your hands over but he didnt turn his hands over

now this infuriated me

if he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadnt wanted to do it that they forced him or something else i would have treated him somewhat differently

but he insolently stuck to his story no i did not do anything it wasnt me

when they turned his hands over the name rita was in fact tattooed on his hand

his face distorted and he whispered something wicked

i immediately flew into a rage

there was an ashtray on the table a really heavy one made out of granite or something very large and it had ashes and butts in it

catching myself quite by surprise i hurled that ashtray at him

but he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall and ashes and butts rained down on his head and back

and he smiled

when he smiled it provoked me further

i dont know how but i jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or strangling him i no longer remember which

when i jumped i caught the microphone cord

the investigator was there tolya 



i no longer recall his last name and he says lyudochka its a japanese microphone

please 





and shut off all the equipment on the spot it was all being video taped

they took him away

i stayed and they talked to me a little to calm me down because we needed to go on working i only remember tolya telling me youre some actress

what a performance

i said tolya honestly 





beforehand they would always tell me lyuda more emotion

you speak as calmly as if nothing had happened to you

i say i dont have any more strength or emotion

all my emotions are behind me now i no longer have the strength 





i dont have the strength to do anything

and he says lyuda how were you able to do that

and when i returned to normal drinking tea and watching the tape i said can i really have jumped over that table

i never jumped that high in gym class

so you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international

of the  we identified there was an armenian a russian vadim vorobyev who beat mamma and  azerbaijanis

at the second meeting with grigorian when he had completely confessed his guilt he told of how on february  the azerbaijanis had come knocking

among them were guysif you can call them guyshe knew from prison

they said tomorrow were going after the armenians

meet us at the bus station at three oclock

he said no im not coming

they told him if you dont come well kill you

he said alright ill come

and he went

they also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict kamo pogosian

he had also been in prison i think that together they had either stolen a motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed

they called him out of his apartment and told him the same thing tomorrow were going to get the armenians

be there

he said no

they pulled a knife on him

he said im not going all the same

and in the courtyard on the th they stabbed him several times in the stomach

he was taken to the hospital

i know he was in the hospital in baku in the republic hospital

if we had known about that we would have had some idea of what was to come on the th

ill return to grigorian what he did in our apartment

i remember that he beat me along with all the rest

he spoke azerbaijani extremely well

but he was very fairskinned maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him too

but later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of shagen sargisian

i dont know if he participated in the rapes in our apartment i didnt see i dont remember

but the people who were in our apartment who didnt yet know that he was an armenian said that he did

i dont know if he confessed or not and i myself dont recall because i blacked out very often

but i think that he didnt participate in the rape of karina because he was in the apartment the whole time

when they carried her into the courtyard he remained in the apartment

at one point i was talking with an acquaintance about edik grigorian

from her i learned that his wife was a dressmaker his mother is russian he doesnt have a father and that hes been convicted twice

well this will be his third and i hope last sentence

he beat his wife she was eternally coming to work with bruises

his wife was an armenian by the name of rita

the others who were detained 





well theyre little beasts

you really cant call them beasts theyre just little beasts

they were robots carrying out someone elses will because at the investigation they all said i dont understand how i could have done that i was out of my head

but we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it thats why they did it

in the name of allah in the name of the koran in the name of propagating islam thats holy to themthats why they did everything they were commanded to do

because i saw they didnt have minds of their own im not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values

no education they work have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly they crowd them in like at the temporary housing and apparently they were promised that if they slaughtered the armenians they would receive apartments

so off they went

many of them explained their participation saying they promised us apartments

among them was one who genuinely repented

i am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident

he worked at a childrens home an azerbaijani he has two children and his wife works at the childrens home too

everything that they acquired everything that they have they earned by their own labor and wasnt inherited from parents or grandparents

and he said i didnt need anything i just dont know 





how i ended up in that it was like some hand was guiding me

i had no will of my own i had no strength no masculine dignity nothing

and the whole time i kept repeating now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife right before your own eyes

he sat there and just wailed

but that leader in the eskimo dogskin coat was not detained

he performed a marvelous disappearing act but i think that theyll get onto him they just have to work a little because that vadim that boy according to his grandfather is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do how to cover his tracks

he was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he knew and those he didnt either and other things as well and changed himself like a chameleon so they wouldnt get onto him but he was detained

that one in the eskimo dogskin coat was at the gambarians after aleksandr gambarian was murdered

he came in and said lets go enough youve spilled enough blood here

maybe karina doesnt know this but the reason they didnt finish her off was that they were hoping to take her home with them

i heard this from aunt tanya and her sons the kasumovs who were in the courtyard near the entryway

they liked her very much and they had decided to take her to home with them

when karina came to at one pointshe doesnt remember this yet this the neighbors old meand she saw that there was no one around her she started crawling to the entryway

they saw that she was still alive and came back they were already at the third entryway on their way to the gambarians

they came back and started beating her to finish her

if she had not come to she would have sustained lesser bodily injuries they would have beat her less

an older woman from our building aunt nazan an azerbaijani all but lay on top of karina crying and pleading that they leave her alone but they flung her off

the womans grown sons were right nearby they picked her up in their hands and led her home

she howled and cried out loudly and swore god is on earth he sees everything and he wont forgive this

there was another woman too aunt fatima a sick aging woman from the first floor shes already retired

mountain dwellers and azerbaijanis too have a custom if men are fighting they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them

but they trampled her scarf and sent her home

to trample a scarf is tantamount to trampling a womans honor

now that the investigation is going on now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to being ourselves a little i think about how could these events that are now called the sumgait tragedy happen

how did they come about

how did it start

could it have been avoided

well its clear that without a signal without permission from the top leadership it would not have happened

all the same im not afraid to say this the azerbaijanis let other worthy people take no offense the better representatives of their nations let them take no offense but the azerbaijanis in their majority are a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law fear of retribution for what they have done

and when the law said that they could do all that like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldnt have time to do everything they threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done to snatch a bit more

the smell of the danger was already in the air on february 

you could tell that something was going to happen

and everyone who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs

many left for their dachas got plane tickets for the other end of the country just got as far away as their legs would carry them

february  was a saturday

i was teaching my third class

the director came into my classroom and said that i should let the children out that there had been a call from the city party committee asking that all teachers gather for a meeting at lenin square

well i excused the children and there were few teachers left at school altogether three women the director and six or seven men

the rest had already gone home

we got to lenin square and there were a great many people there

this was around fivethirty or six in the evening no later

they were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below was supporting them stormily roaring

they spoke over the microphone about what had happened in kafan a few days earlier and that the driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small azerbaijani child off the bus

the speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness that he had seen it himselfthe crowd started to rage death to the armenians

they must be killed

then a woman went up on stage

i didnt see the woman because people were clinging to the podium like flies

i could only hear her

the woman introduced herself as coming from kafan and said that the armenians cut her daughters breasts off and called sons avenge my daughters

that was enough

a portion of the people on the square took off running in the direction of the factories toward the beginning of lenin street

we stood there about an hour

then the director of school  spoke he gave a very nationalist speech

he said brother muslims kill the armenians

this he repeated every other sentence

when he said this the crowd supported him stormily whistling and shouting karabagh

he said karabagh has been our territory my whole life long karabagh is my soul

how can you tear out my heart

as though an azerbaijani would die without karabagh

its our territory the armenians will never see it

the armenians must be eliminated

from time immemorial muslims have cleansed the land of infidel armenians from time immemorial thats the way nature created it that every  to  years the azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth

by filth he meant armenians

i heard this

before that i hadnt been listening to the speeches closely

many people spoke and i stood with my back to the podium talking shop with the other teachers and somehow it all went right by it didnt penetrate that in fact something serious was taking place

then when one of our teachers said listen to what hes saying listen to what idiocy hes spouting we listened

that was the speech of that director

before that we listened to the womans speech

right then in our groupthere were nine of usthe mood changed and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten

our director of studies for whom i had great respect hes an azerbaijani 





before that i had considered him an upstanding and worthy person if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him he seemed like a good person

so he tells me lyuda you know that besides you there are no armenians on the square

if they find out that youre an armenian theyll tear you to pieces

should i tell them youre an armenian

should i tell them youre an armenian

when he said it the first time i pretended not to hear it and then he asked me a second time

i turned to the director khudurova and said that it was already after eight i was expected at home and i should be leaving

she answered no they said that women should stay here until ten oclockand men until twelve

stay here

there was a young teacher with us her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts

she asked to leave i left my children at the kindergarten

the director excused her

when she let her go i turned around said goodbye and left with the young teacher the azerbaijani

i didnt see them after that

when we were walking the buses werent running and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us

they had apparently gotten all fired up

it must have become too much for them and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately so they rushed off

i wasnt afraid this time because i was sure that the other teacher wouldnt say that i was an armenian

to make it short we reached home

then karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there

i started telling of my experience and again my parents didnt understand that we were in danger

we watched television as usual and didnt even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day

thats how it all was

at the city party committee i met an acquaintance we went to school together zhanna i dont remember her last name she lives above the housewares store on narimanov street

she was there with her father for some reason she doesnt have a mother

the two of them were at home alone

while her father held the door she jumped from the third floor and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there wasnt anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony there was no one there they were all standing near the entryway

that building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there

she jumped

she jumped and didnt feel any pain in the heat of the moment

a few days later i found out that she couldnt stand up she had been injured somehow

thats how people in sumgait saved their lives their honor and their children any way they could

where it was possible the armenians fought back

my fathers first cousin armen m lives in block 

they found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town

the armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes knives even with muskets and went up to the roof

they took their infants with them and their old women who had been in bed for god knows how many months they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs

they hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited ready to fight

then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage shes an azerbaijani who lived in their building

they called the school board director and told her that if she didnt help them the  armenians on the roof to escape alive and unharmed shed never see her daughter again

im sure of course that armenians would never lay a hand on a woman it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time

she called the police

the armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town

two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned they surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment into block 

thats how they defended themselves

i heard that our neighbors roman and sasha gambarian resisted

theyre big strong guys

their father was killed

and i heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father but were able to save their mother

one of the neighbors told me that after it happened when they were looking for the criminals on march  to  and detaining everyone they suspected people hid people in our entryway maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead

the neighbors themselves were afraid to go there and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found azerbaijani corpses

i dont know how many

even if they had been wounded and put down there after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infectionthat basement was filled with water

i heard this from the neighbors

and later when i was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it

i know too that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment

and our neighbor carried out our carpet along with the rest he stole it for himself posing as one of the criminals

everyone was taking his own share and the neighbor took his too and carried it home

and when we came back when everything seemed to have calmed down he returned it saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to save

rayas husband and father defended themselves

the trdatovs defended themselves and so did other armenian families

to be sure there were azerbaijani victims although well never hear anything about them

for some reason our government doesnt want to say that the armenians were not just victims but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers too

in the tv show pozitsiya viewpoint a military man an officer said that the armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves

but thats not important the truth will come out regardless

so thats the price we paid those three days

for three days our courage our bravery and our humanity was tested

it was those three days and not the years and dozens of years we had lived before them that showed what weve become what we grew up to be

those three days showed who was who

on that i will conclude my narrative on the sumgait tragedy

it should be said that its not over yet the trials are still ahead of us and the punishments received by those who so violated us who wanted to make us into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators the procuracy and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga tion

thats the price we paid to live in armenia to not fear going out on the street at night to not be afraid to say were armenians and to not fear speaking our native tongue

i think the israeli press might be a tad bit biased in reporting the events

i doubt the propaganda machine of goering reported accurately on what was happening in germany

it is interesting that you are basing the truth on israeli propaganda

since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either arab or palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn

is one form of propoganda more reliable than another

the only way to determine that is to try and get beyond the writers political agenda whether it is on or against our side

  it is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in their signatures i failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your posting

not only because it is the polite thing to do but also to avoid addressing ladies with mr as you have done

secondly the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as cyprus has never been greek but rather it has been home to a bicommunal society formed of greeks and turks

it seems that you know as little about the history and the demography of the island as you know about the essence of turkeys military intervention to it under international agreements

be that as it may an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what is going on today on azerbaijani land can only be drawn with the expansionist policy that armenia is now pursuing

but i could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political conduct of countries and promulgate them in such terminology as itchybitchy onur yalcin

since you are replying to my article you  are assuming that i am an arab

well im not an arab but i think you  are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said

the  bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in lebanon by israel is  very consistent with its policy of intimidation

that is the only  policy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in  the middle east

  in article arensaprgrlisiedu arensisiedu yigal  arens writes   los angeles times tuesday april  

p a

     the problem if transffering us government files about yigal arens  and some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal  or a local american law seemed to belong to some local american law  forum not to this forum

 the readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents  of those files

 so it will be nice if yigal will tell us  

why do american authorities consider yigal arens to be dangerous

im not aware that the us government considers me dangerous

in any case that has nothing to do with the current case

the claim against the adl is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state andor federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself

by that i refer to things such as address and phone number vehicle registration and license information photographs etc

 

why does the adl have an interest in that person 

you should ask the adl if you want an authoritative answer

my guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of israel

i further believe that they did this as agents of the israeli government or at least in agreement with them

at least some of the information collected by the adl was passed on to israeli officials

in some cases it was used to influence or attempt to influence peoples access to jobs or public forums

these matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds since california law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven

as my previous posting shows california law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequences  just for the further dissemination of certain types of private information about them

yigal arens uscisi tv made me do it

arensisiedu

this has been discussed before by several people on this net

the statement is attributable either to hajj amin alhusseini former grand mufti of jerusalem  and the leader of the palestinian death squads during the  war or to one of his chief henchmen

let us not forget the nazi armenians

nazi armenians were of service to germans in arab countries as well

as uzun put it one wellknown case which received a lot of mediacoverage involved two nazi armenian agents which were dropped over syria by italian war planes

the mission of the agents was to mingle among the armenian population in syria and to acquire relevant information for the german wehrmacht on the allied forces in the area

 nazi armenians also helped german propaganda efforts in arab countries designed to promote pronazi sentiments among the french and britishruled arab populations

beirut had traditionally been stronghold of the nazi armenians and until very recently it was the center of international armenian terrorism

in russia general dro the butcher the architect of the turkish genocide in wwi was working closely with the german secret service

he entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the soviets

his experience with the turkish genocide in xsoviet armenia made him an invaluable source for the germans

i sure hope so

because the unspeakable crimes of the armenians must be righted

armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of no

no

no no no no no

it is not justifiable to right wrongs of previous years

my ancestors tortured enslaved and killed blacks

i do not want to take responsibility for them

i may not have any direct relatives who did such things but how am i to know

there is enough current torture enslavement and genocide to go around

lets correct that

lets forget and forgive each and every one of us has a historical reason to kill torture or take back things from those around us

pray let us not be infantile arbiters for past injustice

are you suggesting that we should forget the coldblooded genocide of 

million muslim people by the armenians between  and 

but most people arent aware that in  hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the jews based upon what the armenians did to turkish people in 

after all who remembers today the extermination of the tartars

adolf hitler august   ruth w rosenbaum durusoy the turkish holocaust  turk soykirimi p 

i refer to the turks and kurds as historys forgotten people

it does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in  where a vicious society run by fascist armenians decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse for wiping out a peaceloving industrious and very intelligent and productive ethnic group

what we have is a demand from the fascist government of xsoviet armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people

and the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century

we cannot reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the atlantic so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race

which means that i support the claims of the turks and kurds to return to their lands in xsoviet armenia to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

 pardon me

here is to an amherstclown   your three chiefs dro hamazasp and kulkhandanian are the ringleaders  of the bands which have destroyed tartar villages and have staged  massacres in zangezour surmali etchmiadzin and zangibasar

this is  intolerable

this is about armenia

were you expecting a different response

here is another one source k s papazian patriotism perverted baikar press boston   pages with appendix

p  third paragraph some real fighters sprang up from among the people who struck terror into the hearts of the turks

within a few months after the war began these armenian guerrilla forces operating in close coordination with the russians were savagely attacking turkish cities towns and villages in the east massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time working to sabotage the ottoman armys war effort by destroying roads and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to ease russian occupation

the atrocities committed by the armenian volunteer forces accompanying the russian army were so severe that the russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties

the memoirs of many russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these armenian guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of war then observed in such areas

  journal de guerre du deuxieme dartillerie de forteresse russe derzeroum  p 

 honored me by reproducing my text

unfortunately he has still not produced  the documents on jews in latvia

instead he asks for my views on the  turkish genocide

well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred  other threads

ill let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk  mutluargiccosar a netwide terrorism triangle

and their spurious evidence

  when that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a  nonfascist xsoviet armenian government in the east

now where is  your nonexistent list of scholars

what a moronian

during the first  world war and the ensuing years   the armenian dictatorship  through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its  centuriesold policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by  savagely murdering 

million muslims and deporting the rest from  their  year homeland

this paragraph is wellwritten and interesting serdar baby but it has nothing to do with jews in latvia

i have not presented a list of scholars

how could you

because there is none

i am not interested in an exsoviet why do you write x

its very cute armenian government nonfascist or otherwise

you are not responding to what i am writing

instead you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit

like conversing with a brick wall

and you are not responding to what i am writing

by the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the th century acted upon an entire people

for nearly one thousand years the turkish and kurdish people lived on their homeland  the last one hundred under the oppressive soviet and armenian occupation

the persecutions culminated in  the armenian government planned and carried out a genocide against its muslim subjects



million turks and kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland

after one thousand years turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds

the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye

today xsoviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by xsoviet armenia

today xsoviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity

xsoviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds

you have now done so four times in a row

may i legitimately conclude that you are not indeed a regular netuser but an autoposting computer program

which for convenience i have called mutluexe

you may assert whatever you wish

here we go with mutluexes famed list of sources ditto

 the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance  of genocide in the th century acted upon an entire people

 this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government  and international political leaders such as us

ambassador mark  bristol  and on and on for  lines and still anxiously awaiting  so the list goes on and on and on   im still trying to find out about those jews in latvia

can you post those  documents pleeeeeeease mr argic

puhleeze could you

cmon its my  birthday in three weeks post them for me as a birthday present

  remember the issue at hand is the coldblooded genocide of 

million  muslim people by the armenians between  and the armeniannazi  collaboration during world war ii

anything to add

no darling read what i post

other people are asking you about the turkish genocide

i am asking you to produce the documents on jews in latvia

no matter how many times you erase what i post i will still post the same question

post the documents on jews in latvia

do not autopost the same block of text about the turkish genocide

remember the issue at hand is the armeniannazi collaboration during world war ii and the turkish genocide

and i still fail to see how you can challenge the following western sources

and one recalls that the jews took up their abode in fanatic turkey when they were expelled from europe especially spain by saintly christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers

to one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable

one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate

he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population

 i want the documents of jews in latvia

in april  dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city of van whose  armenians comprised 

percent of the population closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empireleaving erivan on april   armenian volunteers reached van on may  and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during the next two days while the small ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake

knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims

armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire and to assist instead other invading russian armies

their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories

armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves

with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in  at the beginning of world war i the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottomans enemy increased drastically

ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies

and 

an armenian state was organized at van under russian protection and it appeared that with the muslim natives dead or driven away it might be able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient armenian civilization

an armenian legion was organized to expel the turks from the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted russian drive into the bitlis vilayet

 thousands of armenians from mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new armenian stateby midjuly there were as many as  armenians crowded into the van area which before the crisis had housed and fed no more than  people muslim and nonmuslim alike

any comment

argue it with someone else or do not reply to my posts argic my love

i am not arguing about the armeniannazi collaboration

i do not give a thunder about it

i want you to do one of three things a admit that you are not a regular user but a computer autoposting turkish propaganda or b post the documents on jews in latvia or c run away like the coward without a real address that you are and do not reply to my posts

it could be perhaps your head wasnt screwed on just right

in  while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration camps the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis

in  this battalion had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of the former guerilla leader dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the shortlived armenian dictatorship  and the architect of the coldblooded genocide of 

million turks and kurds between 

an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis

encouraged by this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitlers policy of extermination of the jews

this armeniannazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore performance staged by the armenians during wwi when they backstabbed and exterminated 

million turks by colluding with the invading russian army

furthermore as mccarthy put it the armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros armistice with the allies october  

the allies had decided to create a greater armenia including the old russian province of yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of anatolia claimed by the armenian fanatics

only the area called cilicia around the ottoman province of adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the french

the allies quickly set about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks who could be expected to oppose their plans

on april   the british army occupied kars gave civilian and military power over to the armenians then withdrew

the british planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship even though the russian prewar census had shown kars province to be over  muslim

the turks of kars were effectively disarmed but the british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains

the fate of the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in eastern anatolia

murder pillage genocide and the destruction of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the ottoman army

the british had left the scene to the armenian genocide squads

therefore few europeans were present to observe the genocide

one british soldier colonel rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of otoman soldiers saw what was occurring

rawlinson wired to his superiors in the interest of humanity the armenians should not be left in independent command of the moslim population as their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed

to acting supreme command  socialist salah cimcoz socialist nesim mazelyah armenian gangs have been murdering and inflicting cruelties on innocent people of the region

this verified information supported by clear statements of reliable eyewitnesses was also confirmed by general odishelidje commander of the russian caucasian army

armenians are entering every place evacuated by russians carrying out murders cruelties rape and all kind of atrocities which cannot be expressed in writing murdering all the women children aged people who happen to be in the street

these barbarous murders repeated every day with new methods continue and the russian army has been urged to intervene to terminate these atrocities

public opinion is appalled and horrified

newspapers are describing the happenings as shocking

we have decided to inform all our friends urgently about the situation

document no  archive no  cabin no  drawer no  file no  section no  contents no  

to acting supreme command  commander rd army general the situation in the cities of erzincan and erzurum which we have recently taken over is given below these two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the calamities and destruction which they suffered have been destroyed as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of these cities were deliberately burnt by armenians apart from the destruction suffered during the twoyear russian occupation

all barracks buildings of erzincan the cavalry barracks in erzurum the government building and army corps headquarters are among those burnt

in short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down

as to the people of these cities all people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the sarikamis direction for road building and were slaughtered

the remaining people were subject to cruelties and murder by armenians following the withdrawal of russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts

the few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than those of the spanish inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive horrified some driven insane about  in erzincan and  in erzurum

the people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated

the people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in stores left over from the russians

the villages round erzincan and erzurum are in the worst condition

some villages on the road have been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely massacred

let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions

 a long list  a long list and still anxiously awaiting serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

newsserviceuciedu tclockorionoacuciedu tim clock writes   in article apryumaacnscolostateedu bhlancecolostateedu writes   tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed

hezbollah remains the only independent militia

hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son

of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldnt make the lebanese so mad as to do that

furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible

just to address this one point what about the two katyusha rocket attacks made within lebanon for which fatah claimed responsibility

i didnt realize that one can use katyushas while onr is disarmed

also page  of todays new york times faisal saleh a high ranking fatah official and his  month old son were gunned down in beirut by members of abu nidal

there have been  assasination attempts in  alone in the fued between these two factions resulting in  deaths

newsserviceuciedu tclockorionoacuciedu tim clock writes  in article apryumaacnscolostateedu bhlancecolostateedu writes     your view of this entire matter is far too serenely onesided and  selectively naive

 oooh now that hurts

i will not suffer you through more naive and onesided views of mine

please skip my articles in the future oh wise tim and have a good day

 basil what is the point in throwing out onesided viewpoints which means ignoring that the other sides perspective and experience has any legitimacy while assuming that your side possesses no faults and bears no responbility for any of the negative impacts of a particular event

isnt the former onesided

isnt the latter naive

if you feel that my opinion is wrong then please tell me how

strategic withdrawal under the cover of a snide remark seems to be the favored tactic on this net but doesnt accomplish anything

  from center for policy research cpr  subject rejoinder

questions to israelis    to shaigthinkcom   subject ten questions to israelis   dear shai   in the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of  israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information i have  received from other quarters according to which there are two  distinct categories of classifying israelis citizenship  ezrahut and nationality leum

the former is used on passports  etc and the later for daily identification in israeli society

i  am told that people in israel have to carry their id cards at all  times and present them at many public places almost every day

 these id cards make clear who the holder is a jew or an arab

 you maintain that this mainly because of religious services  provided

but do you really believe that this is the reason 

 could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it  serves no other purpose 

a number of points

you are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used

true by law all residents citizens and tourists must carry a form of identification with them

for citizens the standard id is the id card

the purpose this serves on a daily basis wherein they are presented at public places is for the purpose of identifying the bearer

this takes place in banks cashing checks post offices registered mail and such etc quite frankly it was rare that i ever had to present my id card for such activities more than once per week

there is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their id cards in public

furthermore none of the services i outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information

the only case that i can think of in which the leum field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police based upon the scenario

in general though arab citizens are clearly recognizable as are nonarabs

your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially

 in the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that  israel has no fixed borders you state that israels borders were  shaped and reshaped by both war and peace

according to what i  read the first zionists in the beginning of the century had  plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into  transjordan jordan

i also read that it was the express wish of  bengurion to not declare israels borders when israel was  established as this might restrict israels opportunities for  later expansion

israel often claims it right of existence on the  fact that jews lived there  years ago or that god promised the  land to them

but according to biblical sources the area god  promised would extend all the way to iraq

and what were the  borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use  today 

finally if israel wants peace why cant it declare what  it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a  base for negotiations

having all the above facts in mind one  cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism as a  number of wars have proved    

i take issue with your assertions

i think that arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from israeli expansionism

militarily israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile armed and insurgent population for a sustained period of time

as is the intifada is heavily taxing the israeli economy

proof of this can be seen in the israeli withdrawal from lebanon

israeli troops pulled back from the awali and later from the litani in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of katyusha missile fire

public opinion in israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions

the israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the govt is aware of it

with regards to borders let me state the following

i may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position

the arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre borders

if israel were to state large borders the negotiations might never get under way

if israel were to state smaller borders then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations

i think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible

 your answer to my third question is typical of a stalinist public  official

i dont think your answer is honest

you refer me to  vanunus revelations about israels nuclear arsenal without  evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations

now if he said  the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why  should he be punished

i would appreciate more honesty

your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a center for policy research

whether or not all of vanunus revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were

for disclosing state secrets after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public one should be punished

as to which were and which werent i am under no moral obligation to disclose that  quite the reverse in fact

he was taken to court tried and found guilty

you may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of secrets of state something which every democratic govt has

 somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning  hidden prisoners in israeli prisons

he posted an article from  maariv documenting such cases

it seems that such prisoners do  exist in israel

what do you think about that 

i noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist

the clu noted which you evidently did not pay attention to that they know of no such reports or cases

i am sorry to tell you but in a country of  mill as tightly knit as israel even if the matter of the arrest was not made public within a relatively short time frame most people would know about it

my own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of x hours

this would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation

 you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a  way to cast aspersions upon israel

such terms have often been  used by the soviet union against dissidents they call the soviet  union into disrepute

if my questions are not disturbing they  would not call forth such hysterical answers

my questions are  clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts

i would be  very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about  israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so

 i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest  discussion

this is a sign of weakness not of strength

well i am sorry to say that your questions are slanted

such questions are often termed tabloid journalism and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity

such questions were often used during the mccarthy era as a basis for the witchhunts that took place then

to use your own example these questions might have been lifted from the format used by stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture

my answers were not any more hysterical than the questions themselves

the problem is not that the qs were provocative it was that they were selective in their fact seeking

you fall into the same category of those who seek yes no answers when the real answer is of sorts

i suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal no you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit

a sign of strength is the ability to look you remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect

the color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness

 i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth

  news you may have missed apr     not because you were too busy but because  israelists in the us media spiked it

      those intrepid israeli soldiers    israeli soldiers have sexually taunted arab women in the occupied gaza strip  during the threeweeklong closure that has sealed palestinians off from the  jewish state palestinian sources said on sunday

  the incidents occurred in the town of khan younis and involved soldiers of  the golani brigade who have been at the centre of housetohouse raids for  palestinian activists during the closure which was imposed on the strip and  occupied west bank

  five days ago girls at the alkhansaa secondary said a group of naked  soldiers taunted them yelling come and kiss me

when the girls fled  the soldiers threw empty bottles at them

  on saturday a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their  pants when they saw girls from alkhansaa walking home from school

parents  are considering keeping their daughters home from the allgirls school

  the same day soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth  escaped from them at a boys secondary school

deputy principal srur  abujamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls backed them  against a wall and put their arms around them

  when teacher hamdan abuhajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat  him with the butts of their rifles

  on tuesday troops stopped a car driven by abdel azzim qdieh a practising  moslem and demanded he kiss his female passenger

qdieh refused the  soldiers hit him and the yearold passenger kissed him to stop the  beating

  on friday soldiers entered the home of zamno abuealyan  blindfolded  him and his wife put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance

as  the elderly couple danced the soldiers slipped away

the coupled continued  dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening

  the army said it was checking the reports

      israeli troops bar christians from jerusalem   israeli troops prevented christian arabs from entering jerusalem on thursday  to celebrate the traditional mass of the last supper

  two arab priests from the greek orthodox church led some  worshippers in  prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied west bank from jerusalem after  soldiers told them only people with armyissued permits could enter

  right now our brothers are celebrating mass in the church of the holy  sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer said father  george makhlouf of the ramallah parish

  israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of  palestinian attacks against jews

the closure cut off arabs in the west bank  and gaza strip from jerusalem their economic spiritual and cultural centre

  father nicola akel said christians did not want to suffer the humiliation  of requesting permits to reach holy sites

  makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory allowing jews free movement  to take part in recent passover celebrations while restricting christian  celebrations

  yesterday we saw the jews celebrate passover without any interruption

 but we cannot reach our holiest sites he said

  an israeli officer interrupted makhloufs speech demanding to see his  identity card before ordering the crowd to leave

       if you are as revolted at this as i am drop israels best friend email and  let him know what you think

a negative side effect is that my bird now has a somewhat warped view of the mideast

after a small refresh hasan got on the track again

in article flaxaprfrejteknikumuuse flaxfrejteknikumuuse jonas flygare writes  in article aprthundermcrcimmcgilledu hasanmcrcimmcgilledu writes  in article flaxaprfrejteknikumuuse flaxfrejteknikumuuse jonas flygare writes   i get the impression hasan realized he goofed and is now   trying to drop the thread

let him

it might save some   miniscule portion of his sorry face

 not really

since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself  from any name calling i started trashing any article that contains  such abuses without responding to and sometimes not even reading articles  written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company

  ah but in my followup on the subject which you by the way never bothered  responding to there was no namecalling

hence the assumption

 do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer

 or to refresh your memory does the human right issue in the area  apply to palestinians only

also do you claim there is such a thing as  forfeiting a human right

if thats possible then explain to the rest of  us how there can exist any such thing

  use your logic and convince us

this is your golden chance

 jonas flygare well  ok lets see what master of wisdom mr jonas flygare wrote that can be wisdomely responded to  are you calling names or giving me a title

if the first read your paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again

master of wisdom writes in mar

frejteknikumuuse  hasan   flax    hasan    in case you didnot know palestineans were there for  months

   and they are coming back    when you agree to give palestineans their humanrights

   afterall human rights arenot negotiable

   correct me if im wrong but isnt the right to ones life also    a human right

or does it only apply to palestinians

  no

it is everybodys right

however when a killer kills then he is giving   up willingly or unwillingly  his lifes right to the society

  the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by   depriving the killer off his lifes right

 so then its all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis

 the old eye for an eye thinking

funny i thought modern legal systems  were made to counter exactly that

so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom   if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly

sigh

when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories

no i am not neglecting that im merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right to live a as you so eloquently put it human right

we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later

also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights

what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my point in the post that you responded to

the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society

if a state can deprive all its citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all

  in conjugtion with the above when a group of people occupies others   territories and rule them by force then this group would be willingly or   unwillingly deprived from some of its rights

 such as the right to live

thats nice

the swedish government is a group  of people that rule me by force

does that give me the right to kill  them

do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here 

worthy or not i was just applying your logic to a related problem

am i to assume you admit it wouldnt hold

  what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue

  the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law   us law israeli law   and now its very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a  point

excuse me while i throw up

ok master of wisdom is throwing up

you people stay away from the screen while he is doing it 

oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone

ill let you in on a secret its not for real take my word for it

  it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case   is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories

  anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system

 and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem

the question is not which system would solve the me problem

why 

because any system can solve it

the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine

i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved

i assumed that was obvious but i wont repeat that mistake

now that i have straightened that out im eagerly awaiting your reply

joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in  between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal   of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country

the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren

there is no other way out

davar  september  courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter thats the english translations if you have other information id be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older

im not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but its fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics

guess what

those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region

ever

its those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over and willing to give in order to get something back

we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which

well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem 

i think that is fair enough 

no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem

you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

guess where that takes your logic

to nevernever land

the greatest problem of zionism is arab children

we shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary that is clear

the women will be brought before the courts without mercy and where the facts are not sufficiently proved  such borderline cases always happen  they will be sent to a concentration camp

this we must do unless these one million poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the german blood

philosophizing is of no avail in this case

it would be better if we did not have them at all  we all know that  but we need them

those who wish to learn something about the perversion of judaism should consult the masterly work by yehoshua harkabi who was many years the head of israeli intelligence and an opponent of the plo

his your suggestion to learn something about the perversion of judaism from someone you claim has experience in israeli intelligence and the plo is like a suggestion to learn something about the conspiracy of sesame street from someone with experience in fashion design and pizzamaking

latest book was published in english and includes a very detailed analysis of judeonazism

questions to israelis organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost thorinscwruedu although i realize that principle is not one of your strongest points i would still like to know why do do not ask any question of this sort about the arab countries

if you want to continue this think tank charade of yours your fixation on israel must stop

you might have to start asking the same sort of questions of arab countries as well

you realize it would not work as the arab countries treatment of jews over the last several decades is so bad that your fixation on israel would begin to look like the biased attack that it is

everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid center for policy research is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot who hates israel

why dont you try being honest about your hatred of israel

i have heard that your family once lived in israel but the members of your family could not cut the competition there

is this true about your family

is this true about you

is this actually not about israel but is really a personal vendetta

why are you not the least bit objective about israel

do you think that the name of your phonybaloney center hides your bias in the least

get a clue mr davidsson

havent you realized yet that when you post such stupidity in this group you are going to incur answers from people who are armed with the truth

havent you realized that a piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a truth

havent you realized that you are in over your head

the people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or need them to be

this is not the place for such pseudoanalysis

you will be continually ripped to shreds until you start to show some regard for objectivity

or you can continue to show what an antiisrael zealot you are trying to disguise your bias behind a pompous name like the center for policy research

you ought to know that you are a laughing stock your center is considered a joke and until you either go away or make at least some attempt to be objective you will have a place of honor among the clowns bigots and idiots of usenet

 arab leaders dont have to cheat they are actually allowed to have four wives

are you implying above that arab leaders are gays

arent there jewish gays too

arab leaders are now following by islamic rules

or is it only applicable in cases like this

 i remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife saddam also has a mistress

assads brother has a wife and several mistresses and those emirs in the gulf have within their lifetimes wives in the double digitas only they manage to keep four at a time

this is all irrelevant

it takes a lot more than infidelity to make these leaders ruthless and corrupt

maybe netanyahu thought he could cleanse himself by making such a public confession

does the average secular israeli care though

the mossad probably applauded him

    







 

resistance fighters

dont forget that it was the french resistance to the nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in wwii

and all this time i thought it was the us  britian invading normandy the constant round the clock bombing and the fact that the germans were fighting on two fronts

how silly of me

 this is not to devalue the actions of the resistance movements but resistance movements did not defeat the nazis

diplomacy has not worked with israel and the lebanese people are tired of being occupied

they are now turning to the only option they see as viable

dont forget that it worked in driving out the us israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the lebanese government shows that it can prevent attacks on israel and when the syrians agree to leave

the lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long or maybe theyre not capable of getting rid of the syrians and iranians who occupy their land

if they closed down the hezbolah and negotiated a withdrawl of syrian forces israel would be happy to leave

 jaacunixacccolumbiaedu writes   dear mr beyer     it is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom   of racism and violent deragatory

    it is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial   distinction

  in fact if a speach was not offensive to some its  protection under freedom of speach laws would be useless

it is  speach that some find questionable that must be protected be  it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist

it is only  through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can  enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant

that is the  idea behind freedom of expression

 what you find offensive might be perceived as truth by  some and what they might find offensive might be your belief

 it is only through free exchange of ideas and insults as the  case seems to be with this channel that one can change  anothers erring waysthat is why jefferson said that here  we are not afraid to tolerate error so long as reason is left to  combat it

those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin arent curtailing anyones freedom of speech

the neonazi movement has a right to make speeches say anything they want

they do not have a right to have these speeches published by the ny times

that depends on the times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches

likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system

if he feels his resources are being used in a manner that is not in his best interests or are perhaps embarassing to his organization he will act just as the new york times does not to be a conduit for these ideas

the poster is after all freeloading off of someone elses pocket book when he posts

he who controls the purse strings has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds spent or not spent

noone is going to put the poster in jail unless he bombs a local building as a symbol of his hatred

freedom of speech in no way equates to accessibility to conduits of information

the market of ideas has its own natural selection process that weeds out the gaga from the credible ideas that are of importance

check menahem begin dairies published book youll find accounts of the massacres there including deir yassen though with the numbers of massacred men children and women are greatly minimized

as per request of hasan from the revolt by menachem begin dell publishing ny  pp 

apart from the military aspect there is a moral aspect to the story of dir yassin

at that village whose name was publicized throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties

we had four killed and nearly forty wounded

the number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers

the arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy

the fighting was thus very severe

yet the hostile propaganda disseminated throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of dir yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began

one of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in arabic all women children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill

by giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle

a substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt

a few did not leave their stone houses  perhaps because of the confusion

the fire of the enemy was murderous  to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony

our men were compelled to fight for every house to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades

and the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties

the education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war

we never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals

i am convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle

but those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of dir yassin  would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy 

in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah whom mr ben gurion at a moment of great political emotion called the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country

the wise ruler whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal superciliousness

he rejected the apology and replied that the jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of dissidents

throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about jewish attrocities

the enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name

in the result it helped us

panic overwhelmed the arabs of eretz israel

kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting

beitiksa was also evacuated

these two places overlooked the main road and their fall together with the capture of kastel by the haganah made it possible to keep open the road to jerusalem

in the rest of the country too the arabs began to flee in terror even before they clashed with jewish forces

not what happened at dir yassin but what was invented about dir yassin helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield

the legend of dir yassin helped us in particular in the saving of tiberias and the conquest of haifa

 a footnote from the revolt pp to counteract the loss of dir yassin a village of strategic importance arab headquarters at ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story alleging a massacre by irgun troops of women and children in the village

certain jewish officials fearing the irgun men as political rivals seized upon this arab gruel propaganda to smear the irgun

an eminent rabbi was induced to reprimand the irgun before he had time to sift the truth

out of evil however good came

this arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst arabs and arab troops who were seized with panic at the mention of irgun soldiers

the legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of israel

the dir yassin massacre lie is still propagated by jewhaters all over the world

 in reference to denunciation of dir yassin by fellow jews

 this is nonsense

i lived in the negev for many years and i can say  for sure that no beduins were moved or harmed in any way

on the  contrary their standard of living has climbed sharply many of them  now live in rather nice permanent houses and own cars

there are  quite a few beduin students in the bengurion university

there are  good friendly relations between them and the rest of the population

  all the beduins i met would be rather surprised to read mr davidsons  poster i have to say

from center for policy research cprigcapcorg subject symbiotics zionismantisemitism nfid ncdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  from center for policy research cpr subject symbiotics zionismantisemitism zionism and the holocaust  by haim bresheeth the first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda is that zionism without antisemitism is impossible

zionism agrees with the basic tenet of antisemitism namely that jews cannot live with non jews

the history and roots of the holocaust go back a long way

while the industru of death and destruction did not operate before  its roots were firmly placed in the th century

jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in europe

when the hopes for liberation through bourgeoisdemocratic change were dashed other alternatives for improving the lot of the jews of europe achieved prominence

the socialist bund a mass movement with enormous following had to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political zionists

in outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for jews in europe

while the bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of europes workers the zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding europe of its jews by setting up some form of a jewish state

historically nothing is inevitable all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle

history can be seen as an option tree every time a certain option is chosen other routes become barred

because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible

while zionism as an option was taken by many young jews it remained a minority position until the first days of the rd reich

the zionist federation of germany zvfd an organisation representing a tiny minority of german jews was selected by the nazis as the body to represent the jews of the reich

its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in berlin and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period

from a marginal position the leaders of the zionist federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them

all of a sudden they attained political power power based not on representation but from being selected as the choice of the nazi regime for dealing with the the jewish problem

their position in negotiating with the nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the jews in germany transformed them from a utopian marginal organisation in germany and some other countries in europe into a real option to be considered by german jews

the best example of this was the transfer agreement of 

immediately after the nazi takeover in  jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of german goods

this campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott

it was clear that if jews and jewish organisations were to pull out the campaign would collapse

this problem was solved by the zvfd

a letter sent to the nazi party as early as 

june  outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race nation and the nature of the jewish problem and it offered to collaborate with the new regime the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jews abroad against the german development

boycott propaganda  such as is currently being carried out against germany in many ways  is in essence unzionist because zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build

in their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott

the main public act was the signature of the transfer agreement with the nazi authorities during the zionist congress of 

in essence the agreement was designed to get germanys jews out of the country and into mandate palestine

it provided a possibility for jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of german goods to palestine

this right was denied to jews leaving to any other destination

the zionist organisation was the acting agent through its financial organisations

this agreement operated on a number of fronts  helping jews to leave the country breaking the ring of the boycott exporting german goods in large quantities to palestine and last but not least enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies the jews

after all they argued the jews do not belong in europe and now the jews come and agree with them

after news of the agreement broke the boycott was doomed

if the zionist organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the nazis and import their goods who could argue for a boycott 

this was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the german public as complementary

baron von mildenstein the first head of the jewish department of the ss later followed by eichmann was invited to travel to palestine

this he did in early  in the company of a zionist leader kurt tuchler

having spent six months in palestine he wrote a series of favourable articles in der sturmer describing the new jew of zionism a jew nazis could accept and understand

this littleknown episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of nazism between the new regime and the zvfd a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances even after the nature of the final solution became clear

in many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations

a book concentrating on this aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust is postugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust by s b bethzvi

in the case of the kastner episode around which jim allens play perdition is based even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist

it occured near the end of the war

the ussr had advanced almost up to germany

italy and the african bases had been lost

the nazis were on the run with a number of key countries such as rumania leaving the axis

a second front was a matter of months away as the western allies prepared their forces

in the midst of all this we find eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder setting up his hz in occupied budapest after the german takeover of the country in april 

his first act was to have a conference with the jewish leadership and to appoint zionist federation members headed by kastner as the agent and clearing house for all jews and their relationship with the ss and the nazr authorities

why they did this is not difficult to see

as opposed to poland where its three and a half million jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the polish population the hungarian jews were an integrated part of the community

the middle class was mainly jewish the jews were mainly middleclass

they enjoyed freedom of travel served in the hungarian fascist army in fronline units as officers and soldiers their names were hungarian  how was eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated 

the task was not easy there were a million jews in hungary most of them resident the rest being refugees from other countries

many had heard about the fate of jews elsewhere and were unlikely to believe any statements by nazi officials

like elsewhere the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened jewish population were the judenrat

in this case the judenrat comprsied mainly the zionist federation members

without their help the ss with  officers and less than  men plus a few hundred hungarian police could not have collected and controlled a million jews when they did not even know their whereabouts

kastner and the others were left under no illusions

eichmann told joel brand one of the members of kastners committee that he intended to send all hungarys jews to auschwitz before he even started the expulsions

he told them clearly that all these jews will die  a day unless certain conditions were met

the committee faced a simple choice  to tell the jews of hungary about their fate with neutral rumania where many could escape being in most cases a few hours away or to collaborate with the nazis by assisting in the concentration process

what would not have been believed when coming from the ss sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the zionist leadership

thus it is that most of the hungarian jews went quietly to their death assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps

to be sure there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction the trains of prominents which eichmann promised to kastner  a promise he kept to the last detail

for eichmann it was a bargain allowing  jews to survive as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million jews

there was no way in which the jews of hungary could even be located not to say murdered without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friends

no doubt the ss would hunt a few jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in auschwitz

it is important to realise that kastner was not an aberration like say rumkovsky in lodz

kastner acted as a result of his strongly held zionist convictions

his actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions

this is instanced when he exposed to the gestapo the existence of a british cell of saboteurs palgi and senesh and persuaded them to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operations

at no point during his trial or elsewhere did kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those jews

to conclude the role played by zionists in this period was connected to another role they could and should have played that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in europe

they had the information but politically it was contrary to their priorities

the priorities were and still are quite simple all that furthers the zionist enterprise in palestine is followed whatever the price

the lives of individuals jews and nonjews are secondary

if this process requires dealing with fascists nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world so be it

this post has all the earmarks of a form program where the user types in a nationality or ethnicity and it fills it in in certain places in the story

if this is true i condemn it

if its a fabrication then the posters have horrible morals and should be despised by everyone on tpm who values truth

in article hmaprangellcsbrownedu hmcsbrownedu harry mamaysky writes  in article igcapcorg center for policy research cprigcapcorg writes   final solution for the gaza ghetto 

    while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto they  repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and  attempt to starve the gazans

     the jews in the warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and  their families from being sent to nazi gas chambers

groups like hamas  and the islamic jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all  jews into the sea

perhaps we should persuade jewish people to help   these wnderful freedom fighters attain this ultimate goal

  maybe the freedom fighters will choose to spare the cooperative jews

 is that what you are counting on elias  the pity of murderers

  you say your mother was jewish

how ashamed she must be of her son

i  am sorry mrs davidsson

  harry

ok its my turn driving the jews into the sea 

i am sick and tired of this driving the jews into the sea sentance attributed to islamic movements and the plo it simply cant be proven as part of their plan 

pro israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by bnai brith what hamas and islamic jihad believe in as far as i can get from the arab media is an islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under koranic law

this would be a reversal of the  situation in which the jews in palestine took control of the land and its mostly muslim inhabitants

however whoever committed crimes against humanity torture blowing up their homes murders must be treated and tried as a war criminal

the political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice

as for the plo i am at a loss to explain what is going inside arafats mind

although their political thinking seems far fetched with israel acting as a true superpower in the region the islamic movements are using the same weapon the jews used to establish their state  religion

ahmed

forget the syntax ahmed and focus on the semnatics

the fact is that the plo does not recognize israels right to exist

this is perfectly obvious from the plo covenant cairo 

the covenant calls for the destruction of the zionist entity

as far as i know the israeldestruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the plo

if you would like i can post the relevant caluses

now the hamas ideal is far more radical it seems

i know it has been posted here several times and while i do not have a copy of it i am sure that someone does and he or she of course would be more than happy to repost it

regardless of phrasing groups like hamas and the hezbollah and even the newly moderate and politicallycorrect plo have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of israel

it just seems to me that mr davidssons suggestion that jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many jews

harry

ive heard many turks say this and it surpises me that they dont read about itremember the treaty of sevresas a consequence of being in the axis powers in wwithe turks under international law were supposed to look after their minorities ie

greeksarmenianskurdsi must say turkkurd relations are improving slightly with time and not pose a threat to turkeys neighbours

the turks blatantly rejected this treatythe germans grudgingly accepted versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the german peoplethe greeks who had an army therewere there with british and french backing to enforce sevres

 in possibly the first example of appeasement the young turk government managed screwed the treaty of laussane out of the weak alliesthis was after the greek forces were were destroyed at smyrnawhen this occurred incidently french warships were in the harbour and many greeks trying escape swam to the french warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the french as they clawed theyre way up the sides of the ships

libertaeegalitaefraternatae

it seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading

i think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of sevres

first thattreaty was signed by the ottoman empire therefore legally it does not bind the republic of turkey

the new independence movement which by the way is not the same as the young turks naturally rejected it out of hand

to say that we should accept because the germans did theirs is absurd

we saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in hitler

second the sevres treaty was even worse than versailles

it divided the ottoman empire in to several influence zones had the capital occupied the economy under allied control the army di minished to nothing but a police force in short a country in name only

id wonder if you would like to live under such conditions

and for the record i donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in izmir harbour

before evacuating the city the greek forces burned it down so it serves them right

as for being fooled by allied promises that too is your fault

you did not come to anatolia just to enforce sevres but to take part in the plunder as well

madness

  from the israeli press

  paper zman tel aviv tel avivs time

friday local tel avivs  paper affiliated with maariv

  date  february    journalist guy ehrlich   subject interview with soldiers who served in the duvdevan  cherry units which disguise themselves as arabs and operate  within the occupied territories

  excerpts from the article   a lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as  arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods

but the most  important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with

it is  that everyone who serves in the cherry after a time goes in one  way or another insane

gee id better tell this to the mental health branch of the israeli army medical corps 

where would we be without you davidson 

  a man who said this who will here be called danny his full name  is known to the editors served in the cherry

after his discharge  from the army he works as delivery boy

his pal who will here be  called dudu was also serving in the cherry and is now about to  depart for a roundtheworld tour

they both look no different  from average israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript  service

but in their souls one can notice something completely  differentit was not easy for them to come out with disclosures  about what happened to them

and they think that to most of their  fellows from the cherry it woundnt be easy either

yet after they  began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking

 the following article will contain all the horror stories  recounted with an appalling openness

   a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in  which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry

we  called such soldiers hi

hit by the intifada

under my command  was a soldier who talked to himself nonstop which is a common  phenomenon in the cherry

i sent him to a psychiatrist

but why i  should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane 

on  fridays when i come home my parents know i cannot be talked to  until i go to the beach surf a little calm down and return

the  keys of my fathers car must be ready for in advance so that i  can go there

i they dare talk to me before or whenever i dont  want them to talk to me i just grab a chair and smash it  instantly

i know it is my nerve smashing chairs all the time  and then running away from home to the car and to the beach

only  there i become normal    another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother

 it was an omelette of sorts

she took the risk of sitting next to  me and talking to me

i then told my mother about an event which  was still fresh in my mind

i told her how i shot an arab and how  exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it

she began  to laugh hysterically

i wanted her to cry and she dared laugh  straight in my face instead 

so i told her how my pal had made a  mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov  cocktails

he shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as  they deserved

one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire with  the effect that the arab was burning all over just beautifully

i  was delighted to see it

my pal fired three bullets two at the  arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum

it hit  him straight in his ass

we both felt that wed pulled off  something

  next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts  in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that  spot to take a look

i reached the spot first

and then that arab  blood gushing forth from his body spits at me

i yelled shut  up and he dared talk back to me in hebrew

so i just laughed  straight in his face

i am usually laughing when i stare at  something convulsing right before my eyes

then i told him all  right wait a moment

i left him in order to take a look at  another wounded arab

i asked a soldier if that arab could be  saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the  help of a stone of something else like that

i keep telling all  this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight  into my face

this infuriated me

i got very angry because i felt  i was becoming mad

so i stopped eating seized the plate with he  omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over  her head

only then she stopped laughing

at first she didnt know  what to say

  

but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls  upon us frequently

i went with a friend to practice shooting on a  field

a gull appeared right in the middle of the field

my friend  shot it at once

then we noticed four deer standing high up on the sigh

four  deer in tel aviv 

well this is probably as accurate as the rest of this fantasy

 hill above us

my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it

 we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock

we shot down two  deer more and went to take a look

when we climbed the rocks we  saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to  such some milk from its already dead mother

we carefully  inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of  the two deer we had hit

we were just delighted by that sight

we  had hitem so good 

then we decided to kill the young deer too  so as spare it further suffering

i approached took out my  revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short  distance

when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the  bullets sinking in

but my fifth bullet made its brains fall  outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of  blood straight on us

this made us feel cured of the spurt of our  madness

standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like  beasts of prey

we couldnt explain what had happened to us

we  were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we  felt the whole day very badly

   we always go back to places we carried out assignments in

 this is why we can see them

when you see a guy you disabled may  be for the rest of his life you feel you got power

you feel  godlike of sorts

at issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy

this was appraently attempted in the case of vanunu and failed

it has happened before and there is reason to believe it still goes on

the lengthy article you quote doesnt imply this

it only states that it is somehow possible not that it is in any way likely

this is akin to an article saying that it is possible that the usaf has several captured ufos without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion

read this from maariv february  possibly   publication ban  by baruch meiri  all those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way or another look the subject is too delicate

if i comment on it i will be implicitly admitting that it is true if i mention a specific case even hint at it i might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published

in other words they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing

israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have

the us maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft

by refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships us warships have i believe become unwelcome in new zealand which has declared itself a nuclearfreezone

the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public

more precisely a court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment

the usaf has never officially admitted to having any ufos either

in israel of  citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of this country knowing anything about it

not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison for security offenses in complete secrecy

this is stated as a fact without supporting evidence

it wouldve been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail lost to the world as he suggests

maybe elvis or jfk somebody

lets put it this way if israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them how has their disappearance been explained

people have relatives friends and colleagues you know

israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish

would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown

people who are presumed to be imprisoned

this whole conspiracy story isnt something that weve come to associate with yigal arens before

december  author avi raz   subject torture sigh

farwell la donchin e the truth will out interrogative polygraphy lie detection with eventrelated brain potentials

psychophysiology  the research reported here was supported in part by contract number f with the central intelligence agency

preliminary reports were presented at the   and  meetings of the society for psychophysiological research

donchin happens to be an israeli

do you really think that israel needs something as primitive as torture when it has this as well as something brought over by a russian mathematician from the lenningrad military hospital in  factoranalysis of multiple unit activity of the brain 

surely you jest

when israel sics trained dogs on arab prisoners the way its commonly done on prison farms in mississippi or alabama then you have a right to protest against torture

when israeli security personnel beat arab prisoners the way chicago police do then you have a right to complain

since it does not practice physical torture in any way kindly refrain from using this word

josh backonvmshujiacil   title of article moderate physical pressure   several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation  room in tulkarm prison during which he says he was humiliated  beaten and tortured omar daoud jaber heard his interrogator a  shabak agent captain louis chatting on the phone with his wife

 at those moments omar said i felt that he was like a  humanbeing but right after he finished talking he would be beat  me and say you listened to the conversation and enjoyed  yourself and i understood that he was not really a human being

  in late october  after  days in detention at tulkarm  prison omar jaber was released without charges

among the jews  as among the arabs there are good people and bad people he said  after his release but there in tulkarm in the interrogations  rooms you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that  he is a human being

although he left the detention installation  in tulkarm bruised and humiliated i sat at home for ten days

my  hands shook from nerves one may consider omar jaber lucky he  got out not so healthy but entire and even ultimately returned  to normal functioning at the small solar heater plant he owns

  in contrast hassan bader alzbeidi for example was released  seven weeks ago from detention in tulkarm after  days in the  shabak wing cut off from his surroundings

he doesnt speak or  react

mustafa barakat aged only  who was arrested in early  august and was brought to the tulkarm detention installation left  it one day later  dead

we have recently received an especially  large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at  the tulkarm detention installation by shabak interrogators noted  dr niv gordon director of the association of israel and  palestinian physicians for human rights

   the right to complain against the shabak does not excite anan  saber makhlouf a  year old student

in fact he was extremely  fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated  in tulkarm prison in case the publication in the paper would  return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment

  follow description of tortures   omar a tall bearded man was silent

i do not want to talk about  it he finally said quietly

some time later embarrased and  ashamed he spoke sometimes he beats you and beats you until  youll kiss his hand and not only his hand

even the hands of  another interrogator and another whom he calls into the room  and the last interrogator says now you are kissing my hand and  later if i want you will kiss my ass

  these things take place in an israeli army detention installation  located within the military government compound in tulkarm west  bank

but the shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom

in  early march the idf allowed representatives of btselem the  israeli information center for human rights in the territories to  visit tulkarm prison but denied them access to the interrogation  wing

the interrogation wing is shabak property being solely  under shabak responsibility

all interrogations are performed by  it said lieutnant sharon shoan the commander of the  installation according to the internal report written by btselem  member yuval ginbar following the visit

major david peer  governing commander of the prison system in the central command  was quoted in the report there is an ethical problem here  no  one can enter the interrogation wing

i think the israeli press might be a tad bit biased in reporting the events

i doubt the propaganda machine of goering reported accurately on what was happening in germany

it is interesting that you are basing the truth on israeli propaganda

if you consider israeli reporting of events in israel to be propoganda then consider the washington posts handling of american events to be propoganda too

what makes the israeli press inherently biased in your opinion

i wouldnt compare it to nazi propoganda either

unless you want to provide some evidence of israeli inaccuracies or parallels to nazism i suggest you keep your mouth shut

im sick and tired of all you antisemites comparing israel to the nazis and yes in my opinion if you compare israel to the nazis you are an antisemite because you know damn well it isnt true and you are just trying to discredit israel

now if actions of the lebanese resistance help send the isrealis packing im all for it

if you are really concerned about bloodshed a little self criticism could do you a great favor

one of these days youll learn that the way to stop israel from fighting back is to stop attacking

if there were no attacks in the security zone for a year because the lebanese army could maintain the peace then lebanon would be in much better shape

tell me something though

why do syrian troops not get attacked

arent they occupying lebanon

israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave on two conditions

one is a demonstration that the lebanese army can keep the peace

the second is that the syrians pull out as well

turkey claims it allowed humanitarian aid to enter armenia through its border with turkey

what did turkey do it replaced the high quality grain from europe with crap from turkey mixed in dirt and let that garbage through to armenia   armenians lost their lives

this is the latest from upi foreign ministry spokesman ferhat ataman told journalists turkey was closing its air space to all flights to and from armenia and would prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across turkish territory

historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian populations

even the nazis did this much

newsserviceuciedu tclockorionoacuciedu tim clock writes   are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover  israel should totally back down

sothe easiest way to get away with  attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the  other respects innocent lives

 tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong

assuming that they are  using civilians for cover assuming

also come on brad

if we are going to get anywhere in this or any discussion it doesnt help to bring up elements i never addressed nor commented on in any way

i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas they will be injured as both parties continue their fight

the purpose of an armys use of military uniforms is to set its members apart from the civilians so that civilians will not be thought of by the other side as combatants

so what do you think is the meaning behind the intention and the effect when an army purposely does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to look like civilians

they are judging that the benefit they will receive from this cover is more important that the harm that will come to civilians

this is a comment on the israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas do have some responsibility in putting civilians in the middle of this fight

by putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians barracks etc the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians

but if the guerillas do this arent they putting themselves at greater risk

absolutely they ask themselves why set ourselves apart by wearing uniforms when there is a readymade cover for us civilians

that makes sense from their point of view but when this cover is used the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians

 if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working

why  is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages

why  not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone

you see there  is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation  getting backgetting even

it doesnt make sense to shell the  villages

the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli  government for the lives of civilians

i agree with you here

i have always thought that israels bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective

but there is no reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks

as i said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory

it didnt work very well

the host arab state did littlenothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path

  whatso the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states  can start all over again

while i also hope for this to happen it will  only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their  soil

they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way  israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence

  if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has  no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks

this is just another selectively applied statement

the reason for this drawnout impasse between ababspalestinians and israelis is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other

by your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations

that is precisely why the palestinians in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already

they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians to reach full autonomy

do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians

if you do then why should israels view of arabspalestinians be any different

why should they trust the arabpalestinians words

since they dont they are very reluctant to give up tangible assets land control of areas in exchange for words

for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached

 but dont you see that the same statement can be made both ways

if lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy

absolutely so are the arabspalestinians asking first for the israelis word in relation to any agreement

no what is being demanded first is land

when the issue is land and one party finally gets hold of this land what the other party does is totally irrelevent

if i now have possession of this land your words have absolutely no power whether israel chooses to keeps its word does not get the land back

afterall israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in lebanon during slg

  tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been  disarmed

hezbollah remains the only independent militia

hezbollah does  not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up  sheikh mosavi his wife and young son

while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed to crossborder attacks still remain to some extent

rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life yours of that of others

such attacks also continue

 of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon  and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldnt  make the lebanese so mad as to do that

bat guano

the situation you call for existed in the s and attacks were commonplace

furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible

there is no way these groups can be effectively disarmed unless the state is as authoritarian is syrias

the only other way is for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel essentially mirroring israels border secirity on its side

it has to prove to isreal that it is this committed to protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory

  once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain  control

if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel

  tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border

 not lately eh

thats what i said ok

but doesnt that mean that syria has to take over lebanon

i dont think israel or lebanon would like that

 what both sides need is to receive something tangible

the arabs palestinians are looking for land and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to israel

israel has two problems  if it gives up real land it is exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation and that change doesnt help israels position and  when it gives up this land it needs to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks tim

  the way i see it israelis and arabs have not been able to achieve peace  after almost  years of fighting because of the following two major reasons    arab governments are not really representative of their people currently  most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor  dictators

true but maybe not the worst possible  see algeria

   israeli government is arrogant and none comprising

 this was true and i may add the adjective stupid until the intifada

since then no serious israeli leader including shamir really thinks the the occupied territories worth the trouble

the only question became the question of price and other quantitative detail

the best thing the palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the intifada and try to live as normally as possible i know its hard under occupation

otherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing as justified as it may be has caused the palestinians an irreversible damage that prevents them from running a normal state when the time comes

currently it serves no purpose and its just a waste of human life and economic resources

snip in the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied lebanese terrritory is not an act of terrorism or murder

it is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder

this exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth

i agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc is not terrorism

that having been said lets continue

snip imagine 

it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc

i would not argue that all or even most of the villages are terrorist camps

there are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion

some young men usually aged between  to  years are members of the lebanese resistance

even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to

these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time

they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols

every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an  year old girl just happened to be

some of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you describe

not all are

there are a large number of groups in the area backed by various organizations with a wide range of purposes

hizbollah and amal were two of the larger ones and may still be

as to retaliation while mistakes may be made that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing which would have produced major casualties

israels retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw

well here we disagree

i think that israel would willingly withdraw if the lebanese govt was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks

this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed

in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in

actually that is not clear at all

i will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though

there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon

no the syrian govt is more than happy to have israel sink into another lebanese morass

i could elaborate if necessary

i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing cannot be qualified as murder no matter what you say

no but it is regretable as is the whole situation

they also have a very negative effect on the state of things between jews and arabs

so thanks for nothing clown

one of my biggest complaints about using the word fundamentalist is that at least in the usa people speak of muslime fundamentalists muslim but nobody defines what a jewish or christan fundamentalist is

i wonder what an equal definition would be any takers

the american press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to refer to both christians and jews

christian fundementalists are often refered to in the context of antiabortion protests

the american media also uses fundamentalist to refer to jews who live in judea samaria or gaza and to any jew who follows the torah

adam adam shostack adamdasharvardedu if we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure wouldnt waste them on members of congress john perry barlow

  why do jews who dont even believe in god as is the case with many  of the founders of secular zionism have a right in palestine more  than the inhabitants of palestine just because god gave you the land

gd has nothing to do with it

some of the land was in fact given to the jews by the united nations quite a bit of it was purchased from arab absentee landlords

present claims are based on prior ownership purchase from aforementioned absentee landlords award by the united nations in the partition of the palestine mandate territory and as the result of defensive wars fought against the egyptians syrians jordanians et al

 why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of  the inhabitants are not jews and do not want to be part of israel

first i should point out that many jews do not in fact agree with the idea that the west bank is theirs

since however i agree with those who claim the west bank i think i can answer your question thusly the west bank was what is called the spoils of war

hussein ordered the arab legion to attack israel which was a poor move seeing as how the israelis promptly kicked his butt

the territory is therefore forefeit

retaining possession of all of the west bank is not desirable but it beats national suicide for the israelis

put another way one could ask why it is that so many palestinians seem to think that telaviv belongs to them and the future state of palestine

as long as this state of affairs continues it seems that to give the palestinians a place from which they can launch attacks on jews is a real poor idea

giving up the entire west bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint

in addition there is the small matter of jerusalem which is considered to be part of the west bank

the chances of the israelis giving up jerusalem are nil

even leftists who think yasser is a really cool dude like yossi sarid arent going to propose giving up jerusalem

if he did hed get run out of town on a rail

i have no partisan interests  i would just like to know what conversations between terpetrosyan and demirel sound like

 very simple

xsoviet armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide against 

million muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds

after all your criminal grandparents exterminated 

million muslim people between  and 

cyybtzonewscsouiucedu hoviguxacsouiucedu hovig heghinian to which i say hear hear

you must be a new armenian clown

you are counting on asalasdpaarf crooks and criminals to prove something for you

no wonder you are in such a mess

that criminal idiot and its forgednonexistent junk has already been trashed out by mutlu cosar akgun uludamar akman oflazer and hundreds of people

moreover asalasdpaarf criminals are responsible for the massacre of the turkish people that also prevent them from entering turkiye and trnc

sdpa has yet to renounce its charter which specifically calls for the second genocide of the turkish people

this racist barbarian and criminal view has been touted by the fascist xsoviet armenian government as merely a step on the road to said genocide

now where shall i begin

sdpaorg dbdurartusdpaorg david davidian writes   source adventures in the near east  by a rawlinson  jonathan cape  bedford square london  first published    pages

 dd such a pile of garbage

first off the above reference was first published dd in  not  and has  pages not 

second upon checking page dd  we are asked to believe  vd no mrdavidian   vd it was first published in  i have the book on my desknow

vd   vd and furthermorethe book i have does not have  pages either as you vd claimed mrdavidianit has  pagesany question

 well it seems your book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the ncrap posted by mr 

o boy

please can you tell us why those quotes are crapbecause you do not like them

because they really existwhy

as i said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic  you couldnt reject it  in addition the authors preface was written on january   but the book was published in 

here we go again

in the book i have both the front page and the authors preface give the same year  and  january  respectively

anyone can check it at herhis libraryif not i can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct i really dont care what year it was first published or  what i care about is what the book writes about murders torturesetin the given quotes by serdar argic and your denial of these quotesand your groundless accussations etc

   dd i can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim

 vd what is new

 i will post a gif file but i am not going go through the effort to show there is some turkish modified republication of the book like last time

i claim i have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in serdar argics reference hasyou couldnt reject itbut now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around

lets see how you liefrom nonexisting quotes to republication first you said there was no such a quote in the given referenceyou called serdar argic a liar

i said to you no mrdavidian there exactly existed such a quote

i even gave the call number page numbersyou couldt reject it

and now you are lying again and talking about modifiedrepublished book without any proof how when where by whom etc by the way how is it possible to republish the book in  if it was first published in your claimi am sure that you have some pretty well suited theories as usual and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and mrdavidians liesi also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are 

r  and the page numbers to verify the quotes and   it is not possible that s text has  pages mine has  and yours has 

now are you claiming that there cant be such a reference by saying it is not possible

if not what is your point

differences in the number of pages

mine was published in serdar argics was in  no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publicationsetc etc does it give you an idea

the issue was not the number of pages the book hasor the year first published and you tried to hide the whole point the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed torturedetc by armeniansand those quotes given by serdar argic exist

it was the issue wasntit

you were not able to object itdoes it bother you anyway

you name all these tortures and murders by armenians as a crap people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still has so many craps in the 

any question

cwwqawlnewscsouiucedu hoviguxacsouiucedu hovig heghinian  hmm  turks sure know how to keep track of deaths but they seem to lose count around 

million

well apparently we have another son of dro the butcher to contend with

you should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries

if you feel that you can simply act as an armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed

this is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist but a fact

i will dissect articlebyarticle paragraphbyparagraph linebyline liebylie revisionbyrevision written by those on this net who plan to prove that the armenian genocide of 

million turks and kurds is nothing less than a classic unredressed genocide

we are neither in xsoviet union nor in some similar ultranationalist fascist dictatorship that employs the dictates of hitler to quell domestic unrest

also feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest asalasdpaarf terrorists the armenian pseudoscholars or to those affiliated with the armenian criminal organizations

armenian government got away with the genocide of 

million turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide

you and those like you will not get away with the genocides coverup

not a chance

 well zumabot claims just the opposite that greeks are not allowing turks to exit the country

now explain this the number of turks in thrace has steadily risen from  in  to  while the greeks of dr goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed

i have been observing that poly has been practicing goebels rule quite loyally

polys audience is mostly made of greeks who are not allowed to listen to turkish news

however in todays informed world greek propagandists can only fool themselves

for instance those who lived in  will remember the tv news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the american newspapers of july and august  to find out what really happened

there are in turkiye the greek hospital the greek girls lycee alumni association the principo islands greek benevolent society the greek medical foundation the principo greek orphanage foundation the yovakimion greek girls lycee foundation and the fener greek mens lycee foundation

as for greece the longstanding use of the adjective turkish in titles and on signboards is prohibited

the greek courts have ordered the closure of the turkish teachers association the komotini turkish youth association and the ksanti turkish association on grounds that there are no turks in western thrace

such community associations had been active until 

but they were first told to remove the word turkish on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down

this is also the final verdict november   of the greek high court

in the city of komotini a former greek parliamentarian of turkish parentage was sentenced recently to  months of imprisonment with no right to appeal just for saying outloud that he was of turkish descent

this dulyelected ethnic turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years

each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle used by the greek governments to coverup their inferiority complex they display visavis the people of turkiye

the agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term turks which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to muslims

the fact that the greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand nonturkish muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger turkish minority

the pomaks are also a muslim people whom all the three nations bulgarians turks and greeks consider as part of themselves

do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized according to the agreements

poor poly

it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world

the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish minority

they pursue the same denial in connection with the macedonians of greece

talk about oppression

in addition in  the democratic greek parliament passed law no

 virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts

they have ceased to be selfsupporting religious and cultural entities

talk about fascism

the greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus irrespective of the will of the turkish minority as state official

although the orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in greece the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders

talk about democracy

the government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic convention in komotini

such destruction which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the lausanne convention as well as the socalled greek constitution which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments

the government of greece on the other hand is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward hellenizing the region

and you pondered

sidiropoulos the president of the macedonian human rights committee became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the macedonian minority

a forestry official by occupation sidiropoulos has been sent to internal exile on the island of kefalonia hundreds of kilometers away from his native florina

his employer the florina city council asked him to depart in  hours

the greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in copenhagen

he returned to florina by his own choice and remains without a job

helsinki watch a wellknown human rights group had been investigating the plight of the turkish minority in greece

in august  their findings were published in a report titled destroying ethnic identity turks of greece

the report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the turkish minority by the greek authorities

it says for instance the greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in komotini

such destruction which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the lausanne convention

the turkish cemeteries in the village of vafeika and in pinarlik were attacked and tombstones were broken

the cemetery in karotas was razed by bulldozers

shall i go on

why not

the people of turkiye are not going to take human rights lessons from the greek government

the discussion of human rights violations in greece does not stop at the greek frontier

in several following articles i shall dwell on and expose the greek treatment of turks in western thrace and the aegean macedonians

it has been reported that the greek cypriot administration has an intense desire for arms and that greece has made plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on conventional arms reductions in europe

meanwhile greek and greek cypriot officials are reported to have planned to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern cyprus a process that will conflict with the spirit of the agreement on conventional arms reduction in europe

an acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will

but we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings

the rugs at the amfia village mosque were dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there

shots were fired on the mosque in the village of aryana

now wait there is more

greek atrocities in the vilayet of smyrna may to july  inedited documents and evidence of english and french officers published by the permanent bureau of the turkish congress at lausanne lausanne imprimerie petter giesser  held caroline  

pages   

the train going from denizli to smyrna was stopped at ephesus and the  turkish travellers men and women who were in it ordered to descend

and there in the open street under the eyes of their husbands fathers and brothers the women without distinction of age were violated and then all the travellers were massacred

amongst the latter the lieutenant salih effendi a native of tripoli and a captain whose name is not known and to whom the hellenic authorities had given safe conduct were killed with specially atrocious tortures



before the battle the wife of the lawyer enver bey coming from her garden was maltreated by greek soldiers she was even stript of her garments and her servant assie was violated



the two tax gatherers mustapha and ali effendi were killed in the following manner their arms were bound behind their backs with wire and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt end of a gun



during the firing of the town eleven children six little girls and five boys fleeing from the flames were stopped by greek soldiers in the ramazan pacha quarter and thrown into a burning jewish house near bridge where they were burnt alive

this fact is confirmed on oath by the retired commandant hussein hussni effendi who saw it



the clockmaker ahmed effendi and his son sadi were arrested and dragged out of their shop

the son had his eyes put out and was then killed in the court of the greek church but ahmed effendi has been no more heard of



at the market during the fire two unknown people were wounded by bayonets then bound together thrown into the fire and burnt alive

the greeks killed also many jews

do you listen to tough talk of american politicians 

or switch the channel 

i guess i didnt make my point clear

in the case of israel government it is not only tough talk for its intimidation policy

after all not many people are intimidated just by talking

here how it goes tough talks followed by aggressive actions followed by taking pride of those actions and bragging about them

 agressive actions are taken by both sides

tough talk is done by both sides

when an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk i think

and killing people is mildly agressive justified in your opinion if they are israeli soldiers justified in others opinion if they are jews not justified at all in others opinion

when brad wrote the article about  israelis killed ther was a lot of pride and satisfaction in his lines

thats what i feel disgusting

my personal problem with romanian culture is that i am not aware of one

there is an anecdote about armenians troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level

the imageconscious armenians sorely feel a missing glory in their background

armenians have never achieved statehood and independence they have always been subservient and engaged in undermining schemes against their rulers

they committed genocide against the muslim populations of eastern anatolia and armenian dictatorship before and during world war i and fully participated in the extermination of the european jewry during world war ii

belligerence genocide backstabbing rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the armenian history

to obliterate these episodes the armenians engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims

in this zeal they tried to cover up the coldblooded genocide of

nfid rcdpcdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  dear folks i am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment

it is a fact that the inhabitants of gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life

they habe been kept under occupation by israel since  without civil and political rights

it is a fact that gazans live in their own country palestine

gaza is not a foriegn country

nor is telaviv jaffa askalon beersheba foreign country for gazans

all these places are occupied as far as palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it

it is a fact that zionists deny gazans equal rights as israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government

when zionists will begin to consider gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves there will be hope for peace

not before

somebody mentioned that gaza is foreign country and therefore israel is entitled to close its borders to gaza

in this case gaza should be entitled to reciprocate and deny israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area

as the relation is not symmetrical but that of a master and slave the label foreign country is inaccurate and misleading

to close off  people in the strip deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves is a collective punishment and a crime

it is neither justifiable nor legal

it just reflects the abyss to which israeli society has degraded

i would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why israel denies gazans who were born and brought up in jaffa to return and live there 

would they be allowed to if they converted to judaism 

is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin

 anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking hisher sources does not deserve to be believed

on the th commemorative anniversary of the turkish genocide of the armenians we remember those whose only crime was to be armenian in the shadow of an emerging turkish protofascist state

in their names we demand justice

in april  the turkish government began a systematically executed depopulation of the eastern anatolian homeland of the armenians through a genocidal extermination

this genocide was to insure that turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the republic of turkey

the result 

million murdered  billion dollars of armenian property stolen and plundered

this genocide ended nearly  years of armenian civilization on those lands

today the turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior armenian existence on those lands

todays turkish governmental policy is to rewrite the history of the era to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the armenian people

in the face of refutation ad nauseam the turkish historical society and cronies shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred

this policy merely demonstrates that in the modern era genocide is an effective state policy when it remains unredressed and unpunished

a crime unpunished is a crime encouraged

final solution for the gaza ghetto 

while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans

the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks

the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some 

people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel

while polish nonjews risked their lives to save jews from the ghetto no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help the gazan resistance

the only help given to gazans by israeli jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice

a population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors

as is known the israeli regime is considering gazans unworthy of israeli citizenship and equal rights in israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in israeli hotels shops and fields

many gazans are born in towns and villages located in israel

they may not live there for these areas are reserved for the master race

the nazi regime accorded to the residents of the warsaw ghetto the right to self administration

they selected jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance

some jewish collaborators were killed

israel also wishes to rule over gaza through arab collaborators

as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for selfdetermination it must be concluded that the israeli jewish society does not consider gazans full human beings

this attitude is consistent with the attitude of the nazis towards jews

the current policies by the israeli government of cutting off gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by prime mininister yitzhak rabin that gaza sink into the sea

one is led to ask oneself whether israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the gazans 

whether they have some final solution up their sleeve 

i urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans

the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks

the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some 

people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel

while polish nonjews risked their lives to save jews from the ghetto no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help the gazan resistance

the only help given to gazans by israeli jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice

a population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors

as is known the israeli regime is considering gazans unworthy of israeli citizenship and equal rights in israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in israeli hotels shops and fields

many gazans are born in towns and villages located in israel

they may not live there for these areas are reserved for the master race

the nazi regime accorded to the residents of the warsaw ghetto the right to self administration

they selected jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance

some jewish collaborators were killed

israel also wishes to rule over gaza through arab collaborators

as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for selfdetermination it must be concluded that the israeli jewish society does not consider gazans full human beings

from melonsvnetibmcom mike magil subject re final solution in palestine 

lines   ok its my turn   driving the jews into the sea 

 i am sick and tired of this driving the jews into the sea sentance attributed to islamic movements and the plo it simply cant be proven as part of their plan 

 may i suggest you chech out the palestinian national covenant 

it may not use the exact words as quoted above but im sure many will agree that the same message is being issued

later on when i get back home i will try to find the precise sections but you can do the research for now i hope

i also realize that yasser arafat renounced the covenant to the western media only but he has yet to inform the pnc officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue

therefore as far as we are concerned the covenant still stands as the bible so to speak of the mainstream palestinian national movement

pro israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by bnai brith as a staunch proisrael activist i can confidently say that bnai brith has not influenced my opinions on the arabisraeli conflict

as i mentioned above just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the palestinian national movement the plo in most cases

bb does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views

 what hamas and islamic jihad believe in as far as i can get from the arab media is an islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under koranic law

this would be a reversal of the  situation in which the jews in palestine took control of the land and its mostly muslim inhabitants

 what  situation

a negative situation i presume

is this the same situation when the jordanian occupiers of east jerusalem would not allow the jews to go worship at the holiest site in judiasm

was this an example of quranic law being exercised

if not i have another suggested reading for you get into the socculturearabic newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic jews in the quran and may i remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout muslims with some knowledge of the quran

you will find that jews arent really viewed positively by the quran to put it lightly

so how do you think jews or any other nonislamic religion will be treated by an islamic state governed by the words of the quran

i think the  situation in jerusalem will return at best

what do you think

however whoever committed crimes against humanity torture blowing up their homes murders must be treated and tried as a war criminal

the political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice

all i have to say to that is once again see sca  jews in the quran and think again

freedom of choice is definitely not an option in quranic law especially for nonmuslims and all women

remember the gulf war

im sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in saudi arabia an islamic state

 as for the plo i am at a loss to explain what is going inside arafats mind

 probably nothing

aside from how to break the news to his palestinian brethren that the covenant is null and void without getting assassinated himself

although their political thinking seems far fetched with israel acting as a true superpower in the region the islamic movements are using the same weapon the jews used to establish their state  religion

 in conclusion ahmed you should go to the library and find the palestinian national covenant  and read it very carefully

by the way redpath library does have it in stock because that is exactly where i found it when i was doing my research

so enjoy the reading and i hope we will be hearing back from you soon

from bcclevelandfreenetedu mark ira kaufman subject center for anitisrael propaganda organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost thorinscwruedu the center for policy research writes  from the israeli press  hadashot  march   the israeli police department announced on the evening of friday march  that it is calling upon jewish israeli citizens with gun permits to carry them at all times so as to contribute to their security and that of their surroundings

considering all the murders of innocent israelis at the hands of arab death merchants i see nothing wrong with the advice

haaretz  march   yehoshua matza likud chair of the knesset interior committee stated that he intends to demand that the police department make it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills nonjewish terrorists will not be put on trial

as usual the bias of the center for policy research echoes through this newsgroup

here we have an enraged likudnik who is venting his spleen and you portray it as if this is going to become policy

you dont say what the response to matzas suggestion was

do do not mention whether he was refering to terrorists caught in the act which could be a clear cut case of selfdefence

would you care to elaborate on this or was this all you wanted to say on the matter

why dont you give up this center for policy research crap and just post your biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name

haaretz  march  today a private security firm and units from the idf southern command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the gaza strip as an additional stage in the upgrading of security measures in the strip

 the gates will aid in the searching of nonjewish gaza residents as they leave for work in israel

they can be used to reveal the presence of knives axes weapons and other sharp objects

 in addition to the gates which will be operated by a private civilian company large quantities of magneticcard reading devices are being brought to the inspection points to facilitate the reading of the magnetic cards these nonjewish workers must carry

a laudable precaution

every single thing you post about israel is posted to portray israel as negatively as you can

deliberate omissions are an integral part of the shtick

and its not only the incidents that you do not mention but even the stories you do post are fraught with omissions which change the entire meaning

the absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias

in your effort to portray israel in an unfavorable light you have accomplished nothing except to prove that a respectable sounding label like the center for policy research is nothing but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude against israel and the need to vent it

you this center for policy research stuff is nonsense

ps my proposal has nothing to do with nazi eugenics

it has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice

i dont consider that justice is done when nonjews who fled or were expelled in  are not permitted to return to their homeland

how about jews who were expelled from their homelands in iraq syria jordan algeria etc

dont they deserve justice too

this can at best be called pragmatism a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong

it can never be called justice

why is your criticism always directed against israel but never against the arab states even when they are so much more guilty of the accusations you make

is it because you now call yourself a palestinean

and peace without justice will never be peace

this is why the landforpeace formula is so foolish

landforland or peaceforpeace seems much more just except that it would cost the arabs something and so is not under consideration

lets not forget that about half of israels population are refugees from arab countries

somehow their land now being occupied by arab states and their homes now being livedin by arab people are not included in any negotiations

is this your prescription for peace

it is my conviction that the situation in which a state through the law attempts to discourage mixed marriages as israel does is not normal

such a state resembles more nazi germany and south africa than western democracies such as the united states in which jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands

again youve somehow managed to overlook the fact that the arab states are much more restrictive on these points

in fact the officially judenrein policies of almost all of the arab states makes them resemble nazi germany chillingly closely

american jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed christian state and to have their green cards stamped with a mark jew

there are many states in which christians can live happily many which have official religions and christian majorities and christianbased laws

there are some  dozen arab and islamic states

there is only  one jewish state

do you have a problem with this

is this one jewish state too many

there are others who might agree with you you know

i would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that jews who respect judaism are uncivilized

such behaviour is not good for judaism

have you just arrived on tpm recently

again the supporters of the arab and islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of emotional infantile outbursts which have weakened their positions dramatically

somehow your criticisms are very onesided and simpleminded

in article aprbnrca zbibbnrca writes it was shafting on the part of the arab land owners for doing it without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible enough to make provisions for them but rather just leaving them to their fate

if a landlord sells an apartment building vacant to another landlord and fails to notify his tenants they just might find themselves out on the street all of a sudden

the seller may be a scoundrel and a crook but this doesnt make the buyer a thief as israelis are so often called here on tpm

it is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted

do many israelis or jews share your opinion 

do you absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it wasnt written down

 i dont know if others share this opinion

it is mine and im sure there are some who agree and some who dont the way i see it the fallahin were caught in circumstances beyond their control in that since they didnt own the land they didnt have a say

of course now for the sake of the greater arab unity the arabs are angry that the land was sold to the jews an act that is illegal in jordan but when it happened it was just business

the arabs that lived along the coast in western palestine later to be called israel were shafted by their brother arabs just as theyve been shafted for decades since then by their arab bretheren

somehow though the arab call has continued to blame israel not only for the syrian landowner sellout in western palestine israel but even for the occupation of eastern palestine jordan by the hashemites

this is just more of refusing to take blame for ones own actions

infrastructure etc imho the palestinians have grounds to contest the legality of the purchase say in world court

if not us who

  is that so

or you were taking advantage of weakness of ottoman empire to grab some land

as soon as you got green lights from allied forces you occupied izmir and other cities in western turkey

you killed and raped millions people without any reason

of course you paid the price

mustafa kemal ataturk made you swim in aegean sea but not far enough

your aggressions thru turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall not get you anywhere

dont swallow propaganda as truth sir

british promised to venizelos greek pm that mainly greek populated areas of the ottomans will be given to greece if he will agree to drag greece in the side of the british during the wwi because the greek king was progerman

the british succeeded by bombarding athens  killing quite a few forcing abdication of the king division of greece into two separate states northsouth and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our centuryso dont feel bitter that the allies gave any green light because they liked us

anyway the british succeed to establish venizelos war starts at a second front against the germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the east against the russians and finally the wwii came in an end

after that the british and french forgot immediately their promises as usually

even though publicly they say that they support the greek cause practically they not only do nothing but instead using some usual reasoning and other crap rhetoric as a pretext they gradually backup kemal who had given now to the british water and bread that he will dissolve the superethnic ottoman and contract it into a small ethnicstate

the main drive behind this british switch was the plan to keep a muslim state in the region as buffer against a russian expansion into warmwater facilities

the greek empire being an orthodox christian state was too prone to become russian client

out of this intrigue the current state of affairs was established on our lands

while venizelos and kemal were promoted as true giants by the british since they worked to realize their goals in the region

under the same plan currently greece and turkey are recipients of big military funds from the us both they are functioning as antirussian buffers while simultaneously both remain good clients of state dept

because otherwise the use of terror of changing the balance of power in the aegean will be used

under the same exact rational you should see the cyprus problem

gr ps i dont make any antiwhatever rhetoric

this is the situation in our region and needs to be said

the previously mentioned powers are not anything special they are fucntioning the same way which anyone else functions all throughout history

does judaism permit freedom of religion ie

in islam there is no compulsion just a tax on dhimini

a unconventional proposal for peace in the middleeast

 by  elias davidsson  

the emergence of a considerable number of mixed marriages in israelpalestine all of whom would have relatives on both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society

the existence of a strong mixed stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the   sounds just like a racial theory that hitler outlined in mein kampf

 someone else said something similar

i will not comment on the value or lack of value of eliass proposal

i just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of nazi racial doctrine

they were not like eliass idea they were more like the opposite

 nazis believed in racial purity not racial assimilation

an instructive example is the nazi attitude to gypsies

according to nazi theoreticians gypsies were an aryan race

they were persecuted and in huge numbers murdered because most european gypies were considered not pure gypsies but mongrels formed from the pure gypsy race and other undesirable races

this was the key difference between the theoretical approach to jews and gypsies by the way

it is also true that towards the end of wwii even the purist gypsies were hunted down as the theory was forgotten

from jamshidcglucsfedu j naghizadeh subject pr campaign against iran pbs frontline organization computer graphics laboratory ucsf lines  originator jamshidsocratesucsfedu there have been a number of articles on the pbs frontline program about iranian bomb

here is my 

on this and related subjects

one is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about iran in recent months

these include  attempts to implicate iran in the bombing of the new york trade center

despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this

they however have indirectly created the impression that iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter

public statements by the secretary of state christoffer and other official sources regarding iran being a terrorist and outlaw state

and finally the recent broadcast of the frontline program

i suspect that this pr campaign against iran will continue and perhaps intensify

why this increased pressure on iran

a number of factors may have been behind this

these include  the rise of islamic movements in northafrica and radical hamas movement in the israeli occupied territories

this movement is basically antiwestern and is not necessarily fueled by iran

the cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the gulf war which sought to return colonial shieks and amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom

also the obvious support of algerian military coup against the democratically elected algerian islamic front which clearly exposed the democracy myth

a further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of bosnian moslems

possible future implications of this movement in saudi arabia and other us client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region

a need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures

this has become necessary after the demise of soveit union

the recent pr campaign against iran however seems to be directed from israel rather than washington

there is no fundamental conflict of interest between iran and the us and in my opinion it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations

this may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the islamic world and iran 

jamshid

other people have commented on most of this swill i figured id add a few comments of my own

the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks

hong kong and cairo both have higher population densities

the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some 

people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel

there is no fundamental right to work in another country

and the closing of the strip is not a punishment it is a security measure to stop people from stabbing israelis

the only help given to gazans by israeli jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

dozens minus one since one of them was stabbed to death a few days ago

dr azmi suslu russian view on the atrocities committed by the armenians against the turks ankara universitesi ankara  pp



document no  archive no  cabin no  drawer no  file no  section no  contents no  

acting commander of erzurum and deveboynu regions and commander of the second erzurum artillery regiment prisoner of war lieutenant colonel toverdodleyov the things i have heard and seen during the two months until the liberation of erzurum by the turks have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious degenerate characteristic of the armenians

during the russian occupation of erzurum no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs

while the commander of the first army corps general kaltiyin remained in power troops including armenian enlisted men were not sent to the area

when the security measures were lifted the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings

following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these housesplundering was widely committed by the soldiers

this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war

one day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction

the roads were covered with mud and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt

it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps

the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew

the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them

the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also

finally the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished

the incidents of murder and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently

sometime in january and february a leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum was killed one night at his home

the commander in chief odiselidge gave orders to find murderers within three days

the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned

we learnt the details this incident from the commanderinchief odishelidge

they were as follows the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan

large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes

later the murdered turks were thrown into the holes

the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more

thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil

the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty turks and cut their heads off one by one

following the erzincan massacre the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum

the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road and destroyed the entire population together with the villages

during the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages

while the travellers were passing through erzurum the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired

when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds they attempted to help them

however the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from acting

all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing

lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows an armenian had shot a kurd

the kurd fell down but did not die

the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd

however since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the armenian failed in his attempt

having seen this the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot

odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed

their heads had been cut off by axes

he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children

lieutenant colonel gryaznov who passed through the village of ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads

every armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and spat on the corpses

in the courtyard of a mosque which was about x meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of  centimeters

among these corpses were men and women of every age children and old people

the womens bodies had obvious marks of rape

the genitals of many girls were filled with gunpowder

a few educated armenian girls who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done

to the lieutenant colonels disgusted amazement the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle instead of being horrified

the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour

when he told the girls that the armenians including women were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous

an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on february  the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall

they had cut out the womens heart and placed the heart on top of her head

the great massacre in erzurum began on february 

the enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped  people

then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts

people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts

the others the armenians claimed were released when they learnt that i understood what was going on

among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers karagodaviev

today some turks were murdered on the streets

on february  some armenians have shot more than ten innocent moslems

the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death

meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk

when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously how dare you hang an armenian for killing a turk

in erzurum the armenians burned down the turkish market

on february  i heard that the entire population of tepekoy village situated within the artillery area had been totally annihilated

on the same day when antranik entered erzurum i reported the massacre to him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act

however no result was achieved

in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a natural silence

on the night of  february the armenians deceived the russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers

later it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular

the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one

the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand

it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre

the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons for one night and ran away

the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre

however the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others

the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders

i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders

no for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions since they understood that it would yield no result

however such people were only a minority

furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause

some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly

some on the other hand preferred to remain silent

there were certain others who when accused by the russians of infamy would say the following you are russians

you can never understand the armenian cause

the armenians had a conscience

center for regional studies lines  accounts of antiarmenian human right violations in azerbaijan  prelude to current events in nagornokarabakh     right we should slaughter the armenians

and   theres no need to be afraid all of moscow is   behind us

i even heard that all moscow is   behind us

well i watched and listened in and   realized that this was no joke

    deposition of yuri vagarshakovich musaelian born  line electrician sumgait streetcar and trolleybus administration resident at building  apartment  block  narimanov street sumgait azerbaijan i spent almost all of february doing overhaul

the th was a short day at work we worked until eleven or eleventhirty and left for home

i decided to go for a short walk

i went to primorsky park

i walked past the eternal flame and saw a group of about  to  people standing there

when i had walked another  to  yards i heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me

i turned my head toward the sound

it was a light blue gaz volga

i see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car

a man and a woman get out

the man is expensively dressed in a suit and the woman has a raincoat on

she doesnt have anything on her head and her hair is let down sightly reddish hair a heavyset woman

theyre  to  years old

they get something out of the trunk

the people start to help them

i become curious just what are they pulling out of there

when i got up close i heard them turn something on

i didnt see what it was but it was probably a tape recorder

they put it on the ground near the eternal flame honoring the  baku commissars and formed a tight circle around it

i ask whats going on

someone tells me come listen

well they were azerbaijanis i had asked in azerbaijani

i hear appeals brother muslims our time has come 





and something else along that line

i didnt understand what it was all about

i walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder

but the circle drew in tighter

new people started coming from various directions five here seven there

and the comments started right we should slaughter the armenians

and theres no need to be afraid all of moscow is behind us

i even heard that all moscow is behind us

well i watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke

i quietly left and went home

now before that at work i had heard that something was going on in karabagh that there were demonstrations there

well people were saying all kinds of things but i didnt have any idea what was really going on

my wife and son were at home but my daughter was at my aunts house in baku

i didnt say anything to my wife

we sat and drank tea

sometime around two oclock right behind our house suddenly there is noise whistling and shouting

i looked out the window and saw a crowd

the crowd is moving slowly like they show on tv when blacks in south africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly

my wife asks whats going on out there

i say i dont know

i put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about

in the crowd people are shouting down with the armenians

and death to the armenians

i waited for the entire crowd to pass

at first they went down narimanov street on the side with the sk club and the city party committee then they turned and went against the trafficits one way theredown the street of the  baku commissars toward the streetcar line

i went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on

in fact i thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in yerevan and in karabagh

aside from the things they were shouting i was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd

and they were minors under draft age

my wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend but i was kind of uneasy and said no lets stay at home instead

an hour went by or maybe an hour and a half

well i wasnt keeping track of the time i cant say exactly how long it was

i look and see another crowd on narimanov but now on the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the rossiya movie theater

i put outside clothes on and went out again

theres noise an uproar outside and the crowd has grown

there are more people

and whereas the first time there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more aggressive

no i think somethings wrong here this isnt any demonstration

they would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run again

i was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street

i followed them

i was thinking id just watch and see

who knew where this was leading

we came out on lenin square

at the square the sk club is on one side and the city party committee is on the other

i went toward the square and heard noise and shouting as though the whole town had turned out

there was some sort of a rally going on

i go closer and hear exclamations appeals

i heard both antiarmenian and antisoviet appeals

we dont need perestroika we want to go on living like we have been

now what did they mean by living like we have been

the azerbaijanis work like everyone else

but too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others

speculation theft and cheating go on all the time

and not just in azerbaijan everywhere in all the republics but ive never seen it anywhere else like i have in azerbaijan

now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the armenians apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them out

true i didnt hear them say kill them over the microphone i only heard beat them and drive them out

i stayed at the square a few minutes longer

first one then another are going up onto the stage and no one tries to stop the crowd

off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people and i think they were mvd ministry of internal affairs or state security kgb

there were also uniformed policemen there but i didnt see any of them try to pacify the crowd

new people kept coming up onto the stage

well i had finally decided that this could end badly this was no demonstration and i had to protect my family

i left the square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck

it was next to the city party committee on narimanov street it stood next to the tai lors shop there a low truck and it had low wooden panels

i see that some thing is being unloaded crates of some sort

i decided to go look because after all those appeals i was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there

they pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the city party committee but toward the sk club

and when i went right up to them i saw that they were cases of vodka

there were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck and on the ground there were many people  to 

they were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people

two people one case of vodka

and there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps maybe about the size of a fist maybe a little bigger or smaller

it was anasha

when i passed next to that person he stood with his side to me

there was about a yard and a half between us and two people were standing near him

he has a package in his hand and hes pulling out anasha and handing it out

i have never smoked it myself

once i tried it for fun but ive seen a lot of people smoke it ive seen it many times and i know what it is

i strolled around and no one asked me who i was or what i was doing there

before i got to the glass bazaar i heard more howling more warlike shouting

i turned around and saw them running

well ill just keep on going like i am i thought

when they caught up with me i saw that they were carrying flags

and i recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street

hes a young guy  or  years old

he was carrying a red flag which had ermeni oryum written on it in azerbaijani that means death to armenians

that guy used to live off the same courtyard as us

i dont really know what his name is but i know his father very well

his fathers name is rafik he used to be a cook and then became head chef

he used to have a dark blue zhiguli van then he sold it and now he has a white zhiguli 

his family as i said lived on the same courtyard as we did

our building was on narimanov street and theirs was on the street of the  baku commissars their apartment was in the far entryway on the fifth floor the door on the left

now rafiks little brother lives there and he rafik i heard got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict

in a word his son was carrying a flag that said death to armenians

i was surprised because before this i had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from sumgait but by azerbaijanis from agdam and kafan

well anyway i went home

my wife was upset

i told her its ok itll pass theyre young kids theyve just gotten all whooped up

naturally i didnt want her to get overly upset

after a while a new surge of crowd went by

and this time they were breaking glass

i could hear it breaking but i couldnt see where

well i think here we go the machines in motion

they werent handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing

i didnt see people drinking and smoking on the spot but they certainly hadnt unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window

so the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running no one would stop them now they werent even trying although ill say it again the police were there i saw them

and its not just that the police werent breaking them up they were joking with them they were having a good time

true at the time i couldnt even imagine that under our government our much vaunted leadershipand im not afraid to say these words so many people died so many women were abused and how many abominations there werei couldnt imagine that under our muchvaunted authorities and if i were to be specific i would say under the muchtouted authorities in our city of sumgait i couldnt imagine that such things could take place

when they started breaking glass i told my wife and son lets go upstairs

we went to our neighbors the grigorians on the fourth floor

and in the evening when those crowds started going past again i went outside once more

i stopped at the corner a place called that right next to the bazaar

i look and see a crowd on the run

and there a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar are three respectablelooking men of around say  years old

the crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar

and then the whole crowd as though it were one person wheeled and raced toward the bazaar

and not a soul went past those three as though it were off limits

well everything got all churned up there was more noise and the glass was flying again

we spent the night at the neighbors

my apartment was on the first floor there was really no way to defend yourself there

in the morning i went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town

on the way i saw someone hunched up still

i never found out who it was or what happened to him

there were  to  people standing near him

i got the bread and on my way back they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up sort of enclosing him because of the way they were standing you couldnt even see him

that was on the morning of february

the documents including handwritten notes by himmler are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the holocaust is a myth archivists say

the notes give them their authenticity said robert wolfe a supervisory archivist for captured german records

he was supposed to destroy them

like a lot of bosses he didnt obey his own rules

the documents moved out of berlin to what himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place were recovered by allied forces after world war ii from a salt mine near salzburg austria

himmler spoke on oct  in posen poland to more than  german secret police generals

i also want to talk to you quite frankly on a very grave matter

among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly and yet we will never speak of it publicly

i mean the clearing out of the jew the extermination of the jewish race

this is a page of glory in our history which has never been written and is never to be written

emphasis minerje the german word himmler uses that is translated as extermination is ausrottung

wolfe said a more precise translation would be extirpation or tearing up by the roots

in his handwritten notes himmler used a euphemism judenevakuierung or evacuation of the jews

but archives officials said extermination is the word he actually spokepreserved on an audiotape in the archives

himmler who oversaw adolf hitlers final solution of the jewish question committed suicide after he was arrested in 

the national archives exhibit on display through may  is a preview of the opening of the united states holocaust memorial museum here on april 

the national archives exhibit includes a page each of himmlers handwritten notes a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the nuremberg war crimes trials

unlike the plos almost exclusive focus on civilian targets the  troups from the irgun and stern group that struck at deir yassin on april   targeted the village for its military importance

deir yassin was on the road to jerusalem which the arabs had blockaded and it housed iraqi troups and palestinian irregulars

snipers based in deir yassin were a constant threat to jewish citizens in jerusalem

arab civilians were killed at deir yassin but that attack does not conform to the propaganda picture that the arabs have tried to paint

the number of arabs killed was generally reported to be about 

in  however eric silver of the guardian britain interviewed a survivor mophammed sammour who testified that  out of a population of  were killed

about three days after the massacre sammour explained representatives of each of the five clans in deir yassin met at the moslem offices in jerusalem and made a list of the people who had not been found alive

we went through the names

nothing has happend since  to make me think this figure was wrong

unlike the plos deliberate attacks on civilians the killing of civilians at deir yassin was not premeditated

the attackers left open an escape corridor from the village and more than  residents left unharmed

after the remaining arabs feigned surrender and then fired on the jewish troops some of the attackers killed arab soldiers and civilians indiscriminately

independent observers told the guardian that among the bodies they found arab men disguised as women

ok

i donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations

however i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who have the right for it

sounds like wishful guessing

as for the arabian and palestinean voices that are against the current negotiations and the socalled peace process they are not against peace per se but rather for their wellfounded predictions that israel would not give an inch of the west bank and most probably the same for golan heights back to the arabs

an  months of negotiations in madrid and washington proved these predictions

now many will jump on me saying why are you blaming israelis for noresult negotiations

i would say why would the arabs stall the negotiations what do they have to loose 

socalled 

what do you mean 

how would you see the peace process

so you say palestineans do not negociate because of wellfounded predictions 

how do you know that they are well founded if you do not test them at the table 

months did not prove anything but its always the other side at fault right 

why 

i do not know why but if lets say the palestineans some of them want all israel and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis

or maybe they palestinenans are not yet ready for statehood 

or maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership too many fractions aso 

i am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one but any of these could make arabs stall the negotiations

arabs feel that the current negotiations is only for legitimizing the current statusquo and for opening the doors of the arab markets for israeli trade and oranges

that is simply unacceptable and would be revoked

i like california oranges

and the feelings may get sharper at the table

 new details of extensive adl spy operation emerge  san francisco  to the outside world roy bullock was a smalltime  art dealer who operated from his house in the castro district

in  reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and  amassed secret files for the antidefamation league for nearly   years

   the antidefamation league a selfdescribed jewish defense and civil  rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on  groups that are antisemitic extremist or racist

the adls  factfinding division headed by irwinn suall in new york enjoys a  reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with  police agencies and journalists

there is something almost comical in the fact that yigal arens is important enough to have the adl and gd knows who else sifting through his garbage which happens to be legal you throw it out it aint yours any more

this brings to mind a few possibilities other than the adl connection  it is all in arens mind

bullock may have been working for arens friend in the plo  arens father or is it brother

moshe arens former israeli defense minister was spying on him

arens hired bullock to spy on him to get attention

in any case who cares

questions to israelis nfid ncdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  from center for policy research cpr subject rejoinder

questions to israelis to shaigthinkcom subject ten questions to israelis dear shai your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory

in the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information i have received from other quarters according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying israelis citizenship ezrahut and nationality leum

the former is used on passports etc and the later for daily identification in israeli society

i am told that people in israel have to carry their id cards at all times and present them at many public places almost every day

these id cards make clear who the holder is a jew or an arab

you maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided

but do you really believe that this is the reason 

could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose 

in the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that israel has no fixed borders you state that israels borders were shaped and reshaped by both war and peace

according to what i read the first zionists in the beginning of the century had plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into transjordan jordan

i also read that it was the express wish of bengurion to not declare israels borders when israel was established as this might restrict israels opportunities for later expansion

israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that jews lived there  years ago or that god promised the land to them

but according to biblical sources the area god promised would extend all the way to iraq

and what were the borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use today 

finally if israel wants peace why cant it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a base for negotiations

having all the above facts in mind one cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism as a number of wars have proved    

your answer to my third question is typical of a stalinist public official

i dont think your answer is honest

you refer me to vanunus revelations about israels nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations

now if he said the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why should he be punished

i would appreciate more honesty

somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning hidden prisoners in israeli prisons

he posted an article from maariv documenting such cases

it seems that such prisoners do exist in israel

what do you think about that 

you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to cast aspersions upon israel

such terms have often been used by the soviet union against dissidents they call the soviet union into disrepute

if my questions are not disturbing they would not call forth such hysterical answers

my questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts

i would be very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so

i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion

this is a sign of weakness not of strength

i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth

 proven

maybe not

the document is rife with calls to kill jews and spread islam and so forth

 alan stein writes   what are you talking about

the rabin government has clearly  indicated its interest in a territorial compromise that would leave  the vast majority of the arabs in judea samaria and gaza outside  israeli control

just an interrupting comment here since early s  israelis said they are willing to give up the adminstration rule of the occupied terretories to palestineans

palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies them their right of selfdetermination

period

i was just pointing out that not compromising may be a bad idea

from zbibbnrca sam zbib subject relegality of the jewish purchase nntppostinghost  replyto zbibbnrca organization bellnorthern research lines  amir y rosenblatt writes  sam zbib writes no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity

palestinians are no exception

perhaps you heard about antitrust in the business world

 since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions

basic antitrust law says that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm

you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori 

clearly the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate

they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews

 the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality

being a multiethnic  multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion

plus they paid fair market value etc

they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy

im not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss

 right now im just going to address this point

when the jewish national fund bought most of its land it didnt buy it from the palestinians themselves because for the most part they were tenant farmers fallahin living on land owned by wealthy arabs in syria and lebanon

the jnf offered a premium deal so the owners took advantage of it

its called commerce

the owners however made no provisions for those who had worked for them basically shafting them by selling the land right out from under them

they are to blame not the jews

  amir why would you categorize the sale of land as shafting

was it because it was sold to jews

was it fair to assume that the fallahin would be mistreated by the jews

is this the norm of any commerce read shafting between arabs and jews

your claim that the lebanesesyrian landlords sold palestine if true even partially omits the fact that the mandate treaty put lebanon and syria under french rule while palestine under british

obiviously any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in palestine and would be motivated to sell regardless of the price

it is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted

do many israelis or jews share your opinion 

do you absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it wasnt written down

all told i did not see an answer in your response

the question was whether the intent behind the purchase was aimed at controlling the public assets land infrastructure etc imho the palestinians have grounds to contest the legality of the purchase say in world court

sam my opinions are my own and no one elses

 joel i took out sct are we sure we want to invoke the name of he who greps for mason kibos last name lest he include afu in his daily rounds

i dunno warren

just the other day i heard a rumor that serdar argic aka hasan mutlu and ahmed cosar and zumabot is not really a turk at all but in fact is an armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the massacres in armenia of turks so noiseladen as to make serious discussion impossible thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud of confusion

final solution for the gaza ghetto 

while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans

 elias should the families of the children who were stabbed in their high school by a palestinian freedom fighter be the ones who offer their help to the gazans

perhaps it should be the families of the  israelis who were murdered last month by palestinian freedom fighters

the jews in the warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and their families from being sent to nazi gas chambers

groups like hamas and the islamic jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all jews into the sea

perhaps we should persuade jewish people to help these wnderful freedom fighters attain this ultimate goal

maybe the freedom fighters will choose to spare the cooperative jews

is that what you are counting on elias  the pity of murderers

you say your mother was jewish

how ashamed she must be of her son

i am sorry mrs davidsson

 dont forget that it was the french resistance to the  nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the  hostile occupiers in wwii

french resistance may have played some part in hindering the german war effort however the crucial role was supplied on dday

 diplomacy has not worked with israel and the  lebanese people are tired of being occupied

they are now turning to the  only option they see as viable

dont forget that it worked in driving  out the us interesting statement

especially when you consider that lebanon had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks as well as israel

of course one of the prime obstacles to israels complete withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied to the area as well as the large presence of syrian forces which have not been asked to withdraw as well

 please clarify your standards for rules of engagement

as i  understand it israelis are at all times and under all  circumstances fair targets

their opponents are legitimate  targets only when mirandized or some such

  im sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant apriori  that israelis are the black hats and that therefore killing  them is automatically a good thing go hezbollah

the  corollary is that the hezbollah are the white hats and that  whatever they do is a good thing and the israelis only prove  themselves to be bad guys by attacking them

  this sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan i know who cheers  when one of the players on his team uses his stick to permanently  rearrange an opponents face and curses the ref for penalizing  his side

of course when its different when the roles are  reversed

   d c sessions well you should have noted that i was cheering an attack on an israeli patrol inside lebanese territory while i was condemning the retaliatory shelling of lebanese villages by israeli and israelibacked forces

my team you see was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the faces of the spectators in my teams viewing stands so to speak

i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda

there are no a priori black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in retaliation to pinpoint attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the lebanese terrorists

brad hernlem hernlemchessncsuedu

well im not sure about the story nad it did seem biased

what i disagree with is your statement that the us media is out to ruin israels reputation

that is rediculous

the us media is the most proisraeli media in the world

having lived in europe i realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured

the us media as a whole seem to try to ignore them

the us is subsidizing israels existance and the europeans are not at least not to the same degree

so i think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities

 what is a shame is that in austria daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the government makes some of the holocaust guilt go away

after all look how the jews are treating other races when they got power

it is unfortunate

well said mr beyer    clclevelandfreenetedu        h a m z a       foo ie

 well said mr beyer  hehe

the great humanist speaks

one has to read mr salahs posters in which he decribes jews as sons of pigs and monkeys keeps promising the final battle between muslims and jews in which the stons and the trees will cry for the muslims to come and kill the jews hiding behind them makes jokes about jews dying from heart attacks etc to realize his objective stance on the matters involved

   not really

since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself   from any name calling i started trashing any article that contains   such abuses without responding to and sometimes not even reading articles   written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company

 deleted stuff  well  ok lets see what master of wisdom mr jonas flygare  wrote that can be wisdomely responded to    are you calling names or giving me a title

if the first read your  paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the  um well debate again

i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too unless you consider yourself deserveless 

 master of wisdom writes in mar

frejteknikumuuse    hasan    flax     hasan      in case you didnot know palestineans were there for  months

    and they are coming back     when you agree to give palestineans their humanrights

     afterall human rights arenot negotiable

     correct me if im wrong but isnt the right to ones life also     a human right

or does it only apply to palestinians

    no

it is everybodys right

however when a killer kills then he is giving    up willingly or unwillingly  his lifes right to the society

   the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by    depriving the killer off his lifes right

   so then its all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis

  the old eye for an eye thinking

funny i thought modern legal systems   were made to counter exactly that

  so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom      if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at  least spell them correctly

sigh

that was only to confuse you

ha ha ha hey   when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that  the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate  and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on  the ground of occupied territories

  no i am not neglecting that im merely asking you whether the existance  of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right  are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here

 to live a as you so eloquently put it human right

we can get back to the  question of which law should be used in the territories later

also you have  not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights

first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically revokes the right of for its military men

clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate

secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights

 what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my  point in the post that you responded to

the point is that since israel  is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights  to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic  deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society

  if a state can deprive all its citizens of human rights by its actions then  tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all

because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant

   what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue

   the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law    us law israeli law   deleted jonas was throwing upnot for real so you can stick to the screen    it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case    is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories

   anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system

   and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem

  the question is not which system would solve the me problem

why 

because  any system can solve it

 the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine

  i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for   all people involved

i assumed that was obvious but i wont repeat that  mistake

now that i have straightened that out im eagerly awaiting your  reply

so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights

i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

 joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization  said it best when writing in his diary in   between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both  peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal     of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country

 the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of  the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than  to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to  transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be  left only after this transfer will the country be able to  absorb the millions of our own brethren

there is no other way out

 davar  september   courtesy of marc afifi   just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to  getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas  charter thats the english translations if you have other information id  be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to  a private paper even older

im not going to get into the question if he  wrote the above but its fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have  their share of fanatics

guess what

those are not the people that will  make any lasting peace in the region

more deleted stuff exactly you are right

i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like joseph weitz

 we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which

  well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the  imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem 

  i think that is fair enough 

  no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve  the problem

you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by   any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would resolve it justly

 guess where that takes your logic

to nevernever land

you are proving yourself as a  

first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic

too bad for you the master of wisdom

 the greatest problem of zionism is arab children

 rabbi shoham

  oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are  a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit

why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in  if you were a zionists

if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism

if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism

if you are not zionist why are you bothered then

you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts

  from center for policy research cpr  subject ten questions about israel    ten questions to israelis     i would be thankful if any of you who live in israel could help to  provide  accurate answers to the following specific questions

these are  indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by  people around me

i lived there until july  so i think that on the whole my input is relevant

 

is it true that the israeli authorities dont recognize  israeli nationality 

and that id cards which israeli citizens  must carry at all times identify people as jews or arabs not as  israelis 

those are two separate questions

obviously israeli authorities do recognize israeli nationality for some purposes eg

passports consular services etc id cards have a field of nationality which is a subdivision of the above

ostensibly this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the govt though this is not the general case

 

is it true that the state of israel has no fixed borders  and that israeli governments from  until today have refused to  state where the ultimate borders of the state of israel should be  

from its onset israels borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace

as such the israeli govt has always felt that defining its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have been conluded with its neighbors

there is no plan for ultimate borders is this a game like ultimate frisbee

extending into other countries

 

is it true that israeli stocks nuclear weapons 

if so  could you provide any evidence 

aside from what vaanunu provided no

 

is it true that in israeli prisons there are a number of  individuals which were tried in secret and for which their  identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are  state secrets 

if that is true then by virtue of the questions subject it is unanswerable

anyone who claims its validity

is claiming an oxymoron

that having been said i deny the above

you go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious bias

questions of the sort is it true that you entered your mothers vagina

which are based upon some kernel of truth though phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions upon israel

incidentally the answer to the above is usually yes unless you were born via a csection

sdpaorg david davidian who wrote dd problem  dd dd my father told me the following story

during the famous wars between the dd armenians and the persians prince zaurak kamsarakan performed dd extraordinary heroic deeds

three times in a single month he attacked the dd persian troops

the first time he struck down half of the persian army

dd the second time pursuing the persians he slaughtered one fourth of the dd soldiers

the third time he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army

dd the persians who were still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to dd nakhichevan

and so from this remainder find how many persian soldiers dd there were before the massacre

fact by the end of  after the turkish genocide of the armenians there were no armenians left in shirak van or trebizon  only turks and kurds

wants iran to end terrorism links nntppostinghost magnusugmagnusacsohiostateedu organization the ohio state university lines  washington upi  a senior state department official on tuesday ruled out any softening of us attitudes toward iraq but said relations with irans islamic regime could improve substantially if that government disassociates itself from international terrorism

despite the namecalling and the harsh rhetoric from across the gulf despite all this we do not take a position of permanent hostility towards the islamic republic of iran david mack deputy assistant secretary for near eastern affairs said

the primary us objection is irans international behaviour which includes extending support of violence to disrupt the arab israeli peace process and its rapid buildup of dangerous weapons

mack said iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area

mack spoke at the usgcc business conference aimed at promoting gulfamerican trade

he said the middle east will be an item very high on the agenda of the us administration

the importance of the gulf is underlined by secretary of state warren christopers visit last year to saudi arabia and kuwait before anywhere else in the world mack said

he added that the us has no longterm plan to station troops in the gulf

mack also insisted that the clinton administration will continue to pressure iraq to comply with all the un security resolutions

as long as iraq is ruled by saddam hussein we do not expect compliance mack told delegates

 in a previous article tclockorionoacuciedu tim clock says in article aprvirginiaedu abzvirginiaedu andi beyer writes since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either arab or palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn

is one form of propoganda more reliable than another

there are many neutral human rights organizations which always report on the situation in the ot

a neutral organization would report on the situation in israel where the elderly and children are the victims of stabbings by hamas activists

a neutral organization might also report that israeli arabs have full civil rights

the israelis used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters

care to name names or is this yet another unsubstantiated slander

so this is another kind of terrorism committed by the jews in palestine

they do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in palestine

terrorism as you would know if you had a spine that allowed you to stand up is random attacks on civilians

terorism includes such things as shooting a cripple and thowing him off the side of a boat because he happens to be jewish

not allowing people to go where they are likely to be stabbed and killed like a certain lawyer killed last week is not terorism

adam adam shostack adamdasharvardedu if we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure wouldnt waste them on members of congress john perry barlow

adam shostack writes  sam zbib writes  im surprised that you dont consider the acquisition of land by  the jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive  state as a hostile action leading to war

 it was for the purpose of establishing a state not an  exclusive state

if the state was to be exclusive it would not have    arab citizens

could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed

 israeli citizens

the ethnic composition depends on what you mean by formed

what the un deeded to israel

what it won in war

 and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile  action

when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing  to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce

it  is not a hostile action leading to war

no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity

palestinians are no exception

perhaps you heard about antitrust in the business world

were there antitrust laws in place in mandatory palestine

since the answer is no youre argument while interestingly constructed is irrelevant

i will however respond to a few points you assert in the course of talking about antitrust laws

they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews

and those fleeing arab lands where jews were second class citizens

plus they paid fair market value etc jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they bought

they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy

you know sam when people start talking about an international jewish conspiracy its really begins to sound like antisemitic bull

the reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple

zionists made no bones about what was going on

there were conferences publications etc all talking about creating a national home for the jews

israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing

 israel got no western aid in  nor in  or it still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained

and how is granting citizenship a facade

dont get me wrong

i beleive that israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group jews

 bad arabs

personaly ive never heard anything about the arab community in isreal

except that theyre there

so yes theyre there

but as a community with history and roots its dead

because youve never heard of it its dead

the fact is you claimed israel had to give arabs rights because of nonexistant international aid

then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through and again assert that israel is only democratic within the unexplained constraints of one ethnic group

the problem with that argument is that arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please

so please tell me sam what constraints are there on israeli democracy that dont exist in other democratic states

ive never heard anything about the khazakistani arab population

does that mean that they have no history or roots

when i was at ben gurion university in israel one of my neighbors was an israeli arab

he wasnt really all that different from my other neighbors

does that make him dead or oppressed

i stand corrected

i meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in palestine in recent history

i have no problem with jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly jewish

so there

what to make of the rest palestine

how recent is recent

i can probably build a case for a jewish gaza city

it would be pretty silly but i could do it

im arguing not that jerusalem is jewish but that land has no ethnicity

trumpets please

my name is elias davidsson icelandic citizen born in palestine

my mother was thrown from germany because she belonged to the undesirables at that times this group was defined as jews

she was forced to go to palestine due to many cynical factors

forced to go to palestine

how dreadful

unlike other undesirablesjews she wasnt forced to go into a gas chamber forced under a bulldozer thrown into a river forced into a medical experiment like a rat forced to march until she dropped dead burned to nothingness in a crematorium

your mother was forced to go to palestine

you have our deepest sympathies

i have meanwhile settled in iceland  years ago we are pleased to hear of your escape

at least you wont have to suffer the same fate that your mother did

and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland palestine your homeland palestine

because of the same reason they belonged to the indesirables

should we assume that you are refering here to jews who were kicked out of their homes in jerusalem during the jordanian occupation of east jerusalem

these are the same people who are now being called thieves for reclaiming houses that they once owned and lived in and never sold to anyone

these people include my neighbors in jerusalem with the children of whom i played as child

their crime theyare not jews

i have never heard of not being a jew as a crime

certainly in israel there is no such crime

in some times and places being a jew is a crime but not being a jew

my conscience does not accept such injustice period

our brains do not accept your logic yet either

my work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination

those who protest against such practices in arab countries have my support  as long as their protest is based on a principled position but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from israel

the way youve written this you seem to accept criticism in the arab world unless it deflects criticism from israel in which case we have to presume you no longer support criticism of the arab world

the struggle against discrimination and racism is universal

look whos taling about discrimination now

the center for policy research is a name i gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains and which command the support of many volunteers in iceland

it is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds

it is deceiving to judge the resistance movement out of the context of the occupation

alaa zeineldine

what gives isreal the right to keep jeruseleum

it is the home of the muslim a s well as jewish religion among others

israel has a right to keep jerusalem for many reasons

they include the fact that the majority of the citizens are israeli the fact that israel maintains religious freedom for all people and the historical connection of judaism to jerusalem

when jerusalem was devided by a jordanian invasion in  the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit religious shrines

this cease fire agreement was violated by jordan who did not allow jews to visit holy sites under their control

the jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city

they turned a jewish cemetary into a hotel and used the gravestones in their latrines

israel has allowed individuals of all religions into jerusalem protected holy sites and demonstrated its fitness to control the city

also i should point out that islam is not centered in jerusalem but has holy sites there

the home of islam is mecca where all muslims should make a pilgramage the hajj

from abzvirginiaedu andi beyer subject re israels expansion ii organization university of virginia lines  i understand how israel captured the teritory and feels that it is its right to annex it

i cant fully understand why it has to deal with palestinians much the same way jews were treated before the holocaust the final solution by hitler

what i totally dont get is why the us has to subsidize the existance of such a thorough abuser of human rights

just wondering

 in article aprvmmcgillca bhamusicbmcgillca bha writes  so nice of you all to answer some questions

and it so nice that most  of you feel that it would be in your hearts to give the palestinians  some land  most of you focus on the fact that israel annexed all  this land and it is a kind gesture to give some of it back

well  i hope that after after a state run by palestinians is established  the first decision should be to make jerusalem part of this state   by annexing it of course

    steve steve if the israelis are stupid enough to allow a second palestinian state the first one is jordon then you will probably get your wish  and the israelis would get whats coming to them

however if the palestinians were to somehow demonstrate that they could govern themselves and live in peace with their jewish neighbors then they would have to give up the idea of jerusalem as a part of their state  and you would be disappointed

  israel has not annexed any of the west bank just jeruselum

which  will remain part of israel forever

center for regional studies lines    turkey sends light weapons as aid to azerbaijan by seva ulman ankara turkey upi  turkey is arming azerbaijan with light weapons to help it fight armenian forces in the struggle for the nagorno karabakh enclave the newspaper hurriyet said thursday

deputy prime minister erdal inonu told reporters in ankara that turkey was responding positively to a request from azerbaijan for assistance

we are giving a positive response to all requests from azerbaijan within the limits of our capabilities he said

foreign ministry spokesman vural valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to azerbaijan but said they were within the framework of the council for security and cooperation in europe

hurriyet published in istanbul said turkey was sending light weapons to azerbaijan including rockets rocket launchers and ammunition

ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to turkey last week by a highranking azerbaijani official

turkey has however ruled out for the second time in one week that it would intervene militarily in azerbaijan

wednesday inonu told reporters ankara would not allow azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the armenians

we feel ourselves bound to help azerbaijan but i am not in a position right now to tell you what form that help may take in the future he said

he said turkish aid to azerbaijan was continuing and the whole world knows about it

prime minister suleyman demirel reiterated that turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict

foreign policy decisions could not be based on streetlevel excitement he said

there was no immediate reaction in ankara to regional reports based on armenian sources in yerevan saying turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying azerbaijani warplanes and helicopters

the newspaper cumhuriyet said turkish troops were digging in along the border with armenia but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border

no military action has occurred the sources said

the latest upsurge in fighting between the armenians and azerbaijanis flared early this month when armenian forces seized the town of kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside fizuli near the iranian border

blah blah blah blah blah brad you are only asking that that violence that you love so much come back to haunt you nissan

 the armenians in nagarnokarabagh are simply defending their rights  to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are invading their  territorium

homeland

first nagarnokarabagh was armenians homeland today fizuli lacin and several villages in azerbadjan are their homeland

cant you see the the great armenia dream in this

with facist methods like killing raping and bombing villages

the last move was the blast of a truck with  kurdish refugees trying to escape the from lacin a city that was given to the kurds by the armenians

 however i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane  to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one  that happened last summer

turkey searched an american plane  carrying humanitarian aid bound to armenia

 dont speak about things you dont know  american cargo planes were heading to armenia

when the turkish authorities announced that they were going to search these cargo planes  of these planes returned to its base in germany

of these planes were searched in turkey

the content of of the other  planes

not hard to guess is it

it was sure not humanitarian aid search turkish planes

you dont know what you are talking about

turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan it self not the karabag province

so why search a plane for weapons since its content is announced to be weapons

obviously you really dont know

they have spoken out cf secy of state christophers recent trip to the me they have provided millions in aid and they have participated in the airlifts to sarajevo

they would supply military aid if the un would lift the embargo on arms sales

 the turkish ambassador has ocassionally said  a thing or two but thats all i see no great enthusism from any  of those places to get their hands dirty

why does the us always  get stuck with this stuff

 see above

kuwait has directly participated in the airlift of food to sarajevo

 besides theres no case that can be made for us military involvement  there that doesnt apply equally well to say liberia angola or  it appears with the khmer rouges new campaign cambodia

from bcclevelandfreenetedu mark ira kaufman subject re final solution for gaza 

organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost thorinscwruedu center for policy research writes subject final solution for gaza 

  final solution for the gaza ghetto 

  while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans

your comparison with the warsaw ghetto uprising is insulting and racist beyond belief

the attempts to quiet any violence in the gaza strip are just that

the efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came after the violence

it was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of jews

jews had not committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of gaza

i find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than antiisrael bigotry

the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks

the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some 

people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel

it is not punishment but protection from repeated attacks by residents of gaza

you selfservingly omit any references to why israel has had to take action

apparaently the deaths of innocent israeli civilians do not enter into your equation a racist ommission on your part

while polish nonjews risked their lives to save jews from the ghetto no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help the gazan resistance

the only help given to gazans by israeli jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

 the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice

a population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors

the right of israel to protect its citizens from murderers is also recognized by international law

israeli civilians have been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis

if this wave of murder does not matter to you then your posturing for the basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing but an antiisrael charade

as is known the israeli regime is considering gazans unworthy of israeli citizenship and equal rights in israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in israeli hotels shops and fields

do you know of residents of gaza who have applied for israeli citizenship and were denied

i have heard of no such denials taking place

can you document this or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda

the truth is that if gazan residents applied for citizenship hamas would murder them as collaborators

many gazans are born in towns and villages located in israel

they may not live there for these areas are reserved for the master race

how dare you use such a disgusting phrase

how very easy you attack a people when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism

perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are

do you believe that all jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you

heres another little fly in your ointment about the master race for you to avoid two months ago a plane with  bosnian muslims left bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east

four arab nations refused to grant them asylum

then when israli arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them they were allowed into israel

yes israel

but when the plane landed the israeli arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project because they felt that it would make israel look good

it was more important to avoid any good pr for israel than to take care of fellow muslims

israel moved them to a kibbutz where they are safe and secure

the truth is that time after time the islamic world has turned its back on muslims in need more than israel has

even in the case of the  deportees lebanon was willing to let their socalled arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in lebanon

nearly twice as many palestinians have been murdered by other palestinians than in confrontations with israel

hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been deported from kuwait just because they were palestinian

the truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack israel

you are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the palestinians to attacking israel

but the truth is there are greater reasons than israel for the plight of the palestinians

to disregard jordan or kuwait or saudi arabia or any of the other oilrich nations who do nothing for these people is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of jews or your hatred of israel

antisemitism and antizionism is not the same as propalestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare

the nazi regime accorded to the residents of the warsaw ghetto the right to self administration

they selected jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance

some jewish collaborators were killed

israel also wishes to rule over gaza through arab collaborators

your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism cannot be disguised

jews had never declared war on a polish people

jews had never attacked poles with knives or had used the ghetto as a staging ground for attacks

to take something like the warsaw ghettothe creation of which you do not even bother to discussand the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview

you clearly have never even read a single word of the covenant of the islamic resistance movement

here is arguably the single most antisemitic genocidal document since mein kampf yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings

your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation

if it were considered you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner rather than in an antisemitic manner

as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for selfdetermination it must be concluded that the israeli jewish society does not consider gazans full human beings

and just how was gaza obtained

do you forget that israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it but had taken gaza in a war that it did not start

did you know land israel captures in wars wars which other nations have always started arent the same as israel and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws

since you do continuously refer to international law would you please say what specific international laws israel is violating

this attitude is consistent with the attitude of the nazis towards jews

i can cite  reasons why it is not

 the current policies by the israeli government of cutting off gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by prime mininister yitzhak rabin that gaza sink into the sea

where is this quote

i have never heard rabin assert that he wished such a thing

since you are in general a liar youll have to provide the entire quote with source or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications

 one is led to ask oneself whether israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the gazans 

whether they have some final solution up their sleeve 

only you are led to ask such a loaded racist intellectually dishonest question

you inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order

i urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

why do you not feel the same compassion for the jews of iran or iraq or yemen or saudi arabia or syria

do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades

or what about the plight of the palestinians in kuwait

or what about the treatment of the bosnian muslims

do you think the residents of gaza are being subjected to what all the muslims in bosnia are enduring

why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people

why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated

why do you not care that only israel has given any of these people safe haven

could it be due to the fact that it is not israel who is doing the killing

the people in gaza are not being exterminated

they arent being killed

they arent being raped

they arent being starved

they arent being driven from their lands

they are not kept from receiving food or other supplies

but the bosnians are

and the only country which has provided some sanctuary to the bosnian muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking in the guise of compassion

your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are

do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you

in your case it is clear that hate beats out love every time

maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a jew

it is obvious that your hatred of your own judaism is being dumped on all other jews

why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding jews out of existence

maybe these fits of antisemitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period

whatever the case may be it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be

when you realize that you cant care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good

but for now you are a fruad

but did it change the fact that during the period of  to  the armenian government ordered incited assisted and participated in the genocide of 

million muslim people because of race religion and national origin

by the way you still havent corrected yourself

during world war ii armenians were carried away with the german might and cringing and fawning over the nazis

in that zeal the armenian publication in germany hairenik carried statements as follows sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements the jews when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease and when it becomes necessary for a people the nazis to eradicate them in an uncommon method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary

during the surgical operation the flow of blood is a natural thing

now for a brief view of the armenian genocide of the muslims and jews  extracts from a letter dated december   published in the san francisco chronicle as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one b amarian

we have first hand information and evidence of armenian atrocities against our people jewsmembers of our family witnessed the murder of  members of our family near erzurum turkey by armenian neighbors bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely jewish andor muslim

armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors armenians were in league with hitler in the last war on his premise to grant them self government if in return the armenians would help exterminate jewsarmenians were also hearty proponents of the antisemitic acts in league with the russian communists

finally if israel wants peace why cant it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a base for negotiations

having all the above facts in mind one cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism as a number of wars have proved    

oh yeah israel was really ready to expand its borders on the holiest day of the year yom kippur when the arabs attacked in 

oh wait you chose to omit that warperhaps because it  supports the exact opposite to the point you are trying to make

i dont think that its because it was the war that hit israel the hardest

also in  it was egypt not israel who kicked out the un force

in  it was the arabs who refused to accept the existance of israel based on the borders set by the united nations

in  egypt closed off the red sea to israeli shipping a clear antagonistic act

and in  the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the golan heights

children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and israel finally retaliated

nowhere do i see a war that israel started so that the borders could be expanded

the emergence of a considerable number of mixed marriages in israelpalestine all of whom would have relatives on both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society

the existence of a strong mixed stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middleeast in a graceful manner

this is nothing more than feisal husseinis statement that the zionist entity must be disolved by forcing it to engage the surrounding normal arab society

a strong mixed stock integration of israeli society into the middle east in a graceful manner these are the phrases of nazi racial engineering pure and simple

as if israeli society has no right to exist per se



fundamentalist jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage mixed marriages

from their point of view the continued existence of a specific jewish people overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of human rights

the president of the world jewish congress edgar bronfman reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to der spiegel a german magazine

he called the increasing assimilation of jews in the world a calamity comparable in its effects only with the holocaust

this objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions see above the continued existance of a specific jewish people overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of human rights

disolve the jewish people and protect human values such as love and peace yes ve have heard this before her himmler

notice how the source of the problem seems to be accruing to the jews in this analysis

ya der spiegal ist a gut sourcen 

it may objected that such a fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes

this objection has merits

however it must be remembered that huge sums more than  billion are expended each year by the united states government and by us organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the middleeast through armaments

a mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of mixed marriages in israelpalestine thus encouraging the emergence of a nonsegregated society in that worntorn land

so it will be nice if yigal will tell us 

why do american authorities consider yigal arens to be dangerous

adl authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous including the millions of americans of arab ancestry

perhaps you can answer the question as to why the adl maintained files and spied on adc members in california and elsewhere

friendly rivalry perhaps

come on

most if not all arabs are sympathetic to the palestinian war against israel

that is why the adl monitors arab organizations

that is the same reason the us monitored communist organizations and soviet nationals only a few years ago

perhaps yigal is a greenpeace member

or the naacp

or a reporter

or a member of any of the dozens of other political organizationsethnic minoritiesoccupations that the adl spied on

all of these groups have in the past associated with or been a part of anti israel activity or propoganda

the adl is simply monitoring them so that if anything comes up they wont be caught by surprise



why does the adl have an interest in that person 

paranoia

no that is why world trade center bombings dont happen in israel aside from the fact that there is no world trade center and why people like zein isa  palestinian whose american group planned to bow up the israeli embassy and kill many jews

are caught

as mordechai levy of the jdl said paranoid jews live longer

in article aprthundermcrcimmcgilledu hasanmcrcimmcgilledu writes   check menahem begin dairies published book youll find accounts of the  massacres there including deir yassen  though with the numbers of massacred men children and women are  greatly minimized

there is no known writing directly attributable to menachem begin which admits a massacre at deir yassin

thus hasan is wrong

as per request of hasan  from the revolt by menachem begin dell publishing ny   pp 

  apart from the military aspect there is a moral aspect to the story of dir yassin

at that village whose name was publicized throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties

we had four killed and nearly forty wounded

the number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers

the arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy

the fighting the word troops is unjustified

there has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves

according to the haganah observer pail the irgunlehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers

when they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village a small group of palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty

begins failure to even mention the palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies to use a kind word in his account

incidentally three times as heavy may be correct as there is serious evidence that the arab loss was closer to  lives than to the oftquoted  lives

however note that begin compares wounded jews to dead arabs

he fails to mention the number of wounded arabs

guess why

was thus very severe

yet the hostile propaganda disseminated throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of dir yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began

one of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in arabic all women children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill

by giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle

as is thoroughly established by many sources the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning

a substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt

a few did not leave their stone houses  perhaps because of the confusion

the fire of the enemy was murderous  to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony

our men were compelled to fight for every house to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades

and the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties

  the education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war

we never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals

i am convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle

but those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of dir yassin  would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy 

  in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah whom mr ben gurion at a moment of great political emotion called the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country

the wise ruler whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal superciliousness

he rejected the apology and replied that the jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of dissidents

throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about jewish attrocities

  the enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name

in the result it helped us

panic overwhelmed the arabs of eretz israel

kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting

beitiksa was also evacuated

these two places overlooked the main road and their fall together with the capture of kastel by the haganah made it possible to keep open the road to jerusalem

in the rest of the country too the arabs began to flee in terror even before they clashed with jewish forces

not what happened at dir yassin but what was invented about dir yassin helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield

the legend of dir yassin helped us in particular in the saving of tiberias and the conquest of haifa

it is worth noting how begin disputes the standard myth that the palestinian arabs fled as part of a calculated plan

 a footnote from the revolt pp to counteract the loss of dir yassin a village of strategic importance arab headquarters at ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story alleging a massacre by irgun troops of women and children in the village

certain jewish officials fearing the irgun men as political rivals seized upon this arab gruel propaganda to smear the irgun

an eminent rabbi was induced to reprimand the irgun before he had time to sift the truth

out of evil however good came

this arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst arabs and arab troops who were seized with panic at the mention of irgun soldiers

the legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of israel

the dir yassin massacre lie is still propagated by jewhaters all over the world

apparently  of israeli historians are jewhaters

 in reference to denunciation of dir yassin by fellow jews

i have previously posted quotations by irgun participants that totally destroys begins whitewash

i have no particular desire to post it yet again

from aafreenetcarletonca steve birnbaum subject re rejoinder

questions to israelis replyto aafreenetcarletonca steve birnbaum organization the national capital freenet lines  in a previous article cprigcapcorg center for policy research says 

your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what i was told namely that hundreds of thousands of nonjews who left for some reason or other the area under israel control during the war of  were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not jews

jews who also left for example to europe to avoid the clashes were allowed to return

how can you justify such discrimination if this is true 

is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland 

you are conveniently ommitting the fact that the arab governments told the arab citizens of israel to leave israel join with the arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured these arabs could return to their former homes reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to jews

when the arabs lost israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens

what would you have done

let them in so they could kill jews

israel sees those arabs who stayed as citizens because they were loyal to israel during the war and didnt leave

of course some arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible

therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country



you maintain that there are some israeli arabs living in israeli kibbutzim

i wonder how many and where

there is very little evidence available about that

as much as i know many arabs are working for kibbutzim even for many years but are not accepted as members

could it be that kibbutzim do not want arabs 

no kibbutz that i have ever visited has any employees unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants hotels etc if there werent enough people on the kibbutz to do them

in such cases they are paid properly

if a kibbutz turns away an arab i have never seen or heard of this but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz not the whole kibbutz movement

to keep it what way

i am certain that if only religious communities in the us would be asked they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages

but israel has always been ruled by a secular majority

your answer is not satisfactory

this just shows how ignorant you are of israeli politics

although the major parties in israel arent religious however not totally secular due to the format of the government coalition the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition

in fact from what i heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of israel

israel cannot be called a secular state

for instace haifa is the only city in the country except for maybe some arab cities where buses run on the jewish sabbath

there are many other examples of religion in israel

marriages in israel are not contolled by the state but by rabbis and priests

obviously your disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about

steve    internet aafreenetcarletonca fidonet 

  mossadqubeocunixonca   my opinions are not associated with anything including my head 

are you trying to say that there were no massacres in deir yassin or in sabra and shatila

if so then let me tell you some good jokes there is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in wwii palestinians just did what davidians did for fourty years and more

in fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place

people die that is all

no one gets killed

maybe also vietamiese didnt die in vietnam war killed by american napalm they were just pyromaniacs and thats all

maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in therethey may be thought it was like snifing cocaine

no

what do you think of this 

isnt it stupid to say so

well it is as stupid as what you said next time you want to lie do it intelligently

sincerely yours

hassan arab civilians did die at dir yassin

but there was no massacre

first of all the village housed many armed troops

secondly the irgun and stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians

the village was attacked only for its military significance

in fact a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before the attack was to begin

by all rational standards dir yassin was not a massacre

the killing was unintentional

the village housed arab snipers and arab troops

thus it was attacked for its military significance

it was not attacked with intentions of killing any civilians

to even compare dir yassin in which some  or so arabs died to the holocaust is absurd

the irgun did not want to kill any civilians

the village had almost  inhabitants most of whom survived

harry

 from center for policy research cpr subject final solution for gaza 

 while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto fete

since this word both formally and commonly refers to positivejoyous events your misuse of it here is rather unsettling

they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans

i certainly abhor those israeli policies and attitudes that are abusive towards the palestiniansgazans

given that however there is no comparison between the reality of the warsaw ghetto and in gaza

 the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice

just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying entity to maintain order especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure

ironically international law recognizes each of these focusses that of the occupied and the occupier even though they are inherently in conflict

 as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for selfdetermination it must be concluded that the israeli jewish society does not consider gazans full human beings

israel certainly cannot and should not continue its present policies towards gazan residents

there is however a third alternative the creation and implementation of a jewish dhimmi system with gazanspalestinians as benignly protected citizens

would you find that as acceptable in that form as you do with regard to islams policies towards its minorities

whether they have some final solution up their sleeve 

it is a race then

between israels antipalestiniangazan final solution and the arab worlds antiisraeljewish final solution

do you favor one

neither

 i urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

since there is justifiable worry by various parties that israel and arabpalestinian final solution intentions exist isnt it important that both israeli and palestiniangazan rights be secured

stssdxbstunocalcom dorin baru writes  even the most extemist one sided jewishisraeli postings with which i  certainly disagree did not openly back plain murder

you do

  the lebanese resistance you are talking about is a bunch of lebanese  farmers who detonate bombs after work or is an organized entity of not  onlylebanese well trained mercenaries 

i do not know just curious

  i guess you also back the killings of hundreds of marines in beirut right

  what kind of resistance movement killed jewish attlets in munich  

  you liked it didnt you 

   you posted some other garbage before so at least you seem to be consistent

  dorin dorin lets not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered

the distinction is not trivial

murder happens to innocent people not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed

it just so happened that these soldiers in the line of duty were killed by the opposition

and resistance is different from terrorism

certainly the athletes in munich were victims of terrorists though some might call them freedom fighters

and some of us call them murderous bastards but whats in a name

their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters

dont forget that it was the french resistance to the nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in wwii

diplomacy has not worked with israel and the just a damn minute

what history books did you read

i seem to recall that there were a few british canadian american and commonwealth soldiers in france about that time

perhaps you believe they were taking a vacation trip

lebanese people are tired of being occupied

they are now turning to the only option they see as viable

dont forget that it worked in driving out the us sure the lebanese want to get all foreigners out of the country so they can go back to killing each other off

from nabilarielyorkuca nabil gangi subject dear mr ajami organization york university toronto canada lines  i have read just today two articles dripping of hate and offence to a great deal of people

i could find as much matching hatred in your articles as i have found in some of the selfrighteous killinthename of god people

i dont know why you are so attcaking to everyone is it a reaction to the hatred calls on this newsgroup or is it a reaction to hardships you have seen and experienced from before

i have learnt not to judge people by only what they say but rather try to put myself in their place and aspire to understand their feelings

i hope you would be able to do the same with everyone starting by your ownself because only through that you could be able to understand your feelings and act in a the manner you would aspire everyone to adopt

thanks for your time nabil

are you aware that there is an arms embargo on all of what iswas yugoslavia including bosnia which guarantees massive military superiority of serbian forces and does not allow the bosnians to try to defend themselves

should we sell weapons to all sides or just the losing one then

 ending an embargo does not we must sell anything at all

right

well probably end up giving them weapons

if the europeans want to sell weapons to one or both sides they are welcome as far as im concerned

 you seem to oppose ending the embargo

you know it is difficult for europeans to sell weapons when there is an embargo in place

during wwii the british managed to supply arms to the yugoslavs despite german occupation

if the europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into bosnia

i guess i would favor ending the embargo if the congress would pass a law forbidding export of us military supplies to yugoslavia including via third parties

until then the risks of the us being drawn into a more active role would be too great

i do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war

i do not automatically accept the argument that bosnia is any worse than other recent civil wars say vietnam for instance

the difference is it is happening to white people inside europe with lots of tv coverage

 but if this was the reason and if furthermore both sides are equal wouldnt all us racist americans be favoring the good christians serbs instead of the nonchristians we really seem to favor

both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press

and thats about all we have to go on isnt it

and i wish youd quit hurling words like racist around

there are many levels at which people react to what they see

at the most fundamental level you do not have to consciously recognize the racial element  you simply tend to empathize more with people who are like yourself

as far preferring christian over moslem i am an atheist myself and i think youll agree that in the us the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of religion nor give it a particularly important place in their world view

from dbdurartusdpaorg david davidian subject lezgians astir in azerbaijan and daghestan summary asking not to fight against armenians in karabakh  for unification organization sdpa

center for regional studies lines    lezghis astir by nejla sammakia associated press writer gussar azerbaijan ap  the  lezghis of azerbaijan and russia have begun clamoring for their own state threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner of the caucasus

the region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring nagornokarabakh abkhazia and ossetia but lezhgis could become the next minority in the former soviet union to fight for independence

lezghis who are muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in azerbaijans yearold undeclared war with armenia

they also want to unite the lezghi regions of azerbaijan and russia which were effectively one until the breakup of the soviet union created national borders that had been only lines on a map

a rally of more than  lezghis in march to protest conscription and demand a separate lezghistan alarmed the azerbaijani government

officials in baku the capital deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death

but the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with russian authorities to control the movement of lezhgis living across the border in the dagestan region of russia

visitors to gussar the center of lezhgi life found the town quiet soon after the protest

children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air

at the sunday bazaar men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the russian border to a war they say is not theirs

i have been drafted but i wont go said shamil kadimov gold teeth glinting in the sun

why must i fight a war for the azerbaijanis

i have nothing to do with armenia

more than  people have died in the war which centers on the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh about  miles to the southeast

malik kerimov an official in the mayors office said only  of  locals drafted in  had served

the police dont force people to go he said

they are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by lezghis in dagestan

all the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators but disagreed on how the protest came about

some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that azerbaijan was about to draft  men from the gussar region where  lezghis live

others said the rally was ordered by gen muhieddin kahramanov leader of the lezhgi underground separatist movement sadval based in dagestan

we organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders said kerim babayev a mathematics teacher who belongs to sadval

we hope to reunite peacefully by approaching everyone  the azerbaijanis the russians

in the early th century the lezhgis formed two khanates or sovereignties in what are now azerbaijan and dagestan

they roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates

by  the lezghi areas were joined to czarist russia

after  they came under soviet rule

with the disintegration of the soviet union the  lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders

about half remained in dagestan and half in newly independent azerbaijan

we have to pay customs on all this on cars on wine complained mais talibov a small trader

his goods laid out on the ground at the bazaar included brandy stomach medication and plastic shoes from dagestan

we want our own country he said

we want to be able to move about easily

but baku wont listen to us

physically it is hard for outsiders to distinguish lezhgis from other azerbaijanis

in many villages they live side by side working at the same jobs and intermarrying to some degree

but the lezhgis have a distinctive language a mixture of arabic turkish and persian with strong guttural vowels

azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its  largest ethnic minorities

the lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary school classes in their language

autonomy is a different question

if the lezghis succeeded in separating from azerbaijan they would set a precedent for other minorities such as the talish in the south the tats in the nearby mountains and the avars of eastern azerbaijan

 in article aprkpccom henrikquaylekpccom writes  stuff deleted  henrik country

turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the henrik karabakh conflict with azerbaijan

bm gimme a break

capital letters or not the above is pure nonsense

it bm seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities  again armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves

what do want them to do

lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them

bm while hoping that turkey will stay out

stop and think for a moment bm will you

armenia doesnt need anyone to drag her into the conflict it bm is a part of it

armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged training azeris militarily to fight against karabakhiarmenians

henrik the karabakhiarmenians who have lived in their homeland for  henrik years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are the henrik ones directly involved in the conflict

they are defending henrik themselves against azeri aggression

bm huh

you didnt expect azeris to be friendly to forces fighting with them bm within their borders

well history is sad

remember those are relocated azeris into the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime

henrik at last i hope that the us insists that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never henrik occur again

bm youre not playing with a full deck are you

where would turkey invade

it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped into armenia if she could

bm are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with scg

in the header bm in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun

absolutely not 

i am merely trying to emphasize that in many cases history repeats itself

bm yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes bm she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring bm the parties to the negotiating table

thats hard to do when armenians bm are attacking azeri towns

so let me understand in plain words what you are saying turkey wants a peaceful end to this conflict

not 

i will believe it when i see it

now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a gun pointing to your head 

do you sit there and watch or defend yourseffat chance

do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku 

all the barberian acts especially against mothers and their children

i mean burning people alive 

bm armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the bm futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis thats bm going to cause incessant skirmishes

armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic

they are not asking much

they simply want to get back what was taken away from them and given to azeris by stalin

bm think of  or  years down the line  both of the newly independent bm countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe bm the other out

these people will be neighbors would it not be better bm to keep the bad blood between them minimal

dont get me wrong

i also want peaceful solution to the conflict

but until azeris realize that the armenians in karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion

bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes bm your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of bm their blood and future

again you are taking different turns

armenia has no intension to grab any land from azerbaijan

the armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves until a solution is set

bm its easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled

the armenians bm in armenia and nk will be there with the same people you seem to hate bm as their neighbors for maybe  years more

the sooner theres peace in bm the region the better it is for them and everyone else

id push for bm compromise if i were you instead of hitting the capslock and spreading bm inflammatory halftruths

it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative

i am absolutely for it

but in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself you will be wiped out

such as the case in the era of  of the armenian massacres

i dont think so

if those people use it because they are used to do so then i understand

but open any map today except a few that try to be political you will see that the name of the city is printed as istanbul

so dont try to give any arguments to using konstantinopolis except to cause some flames to make some political statement

lets see how you liefrom nonexisting quotes to republication first you said there was no such a quote in the given referenceyou called serdar argic a liar

i said to you no mrdavidian there exactly existed such a quote

differences in the number of pages

mine was published in serdar argics was in  no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publicationsetc etc does it give you an idea

the issue was not the number of pages the book hasor the year first published and you tried to hide the whole point the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed torturedetc by armeniansand those quotes given by serdar argic exist

it was the issue wasntit

well apparently we have another son of dro the butcher to contend with

you should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries

if you feel that you can simply act as an armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed

this is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist but a fact

i will dissect articlebyarticle paragraphbyparagraph linebyline liebylie revisionbyrevision written by those on this net who plan to prove that the armenian genocide of 

million turks and kurds is nothing less than a classic unredressed genocide

we are neither in xsoviet union nor in some similar ultranationalist fascist dictatorship that employs the dictates of hitler to quell domestic unrest

also feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest asalasdpaarf terrorists the armenian pseudoscholars or to those affiliated with the armenian criminal organizations

armenian government got away with the genocide of 

million turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide

you and those like you will not get away with the genocides coverup

not a chance

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

 tell me do these young men also attack syrian troops

in the south lebanon area only israeli and sla and lebanese troops are present

syrian troops are deployed north of the awali river

between the awali river and the security zone only lebanese troops are stationed

  with the blood of its soldiers

if israel is interested in peace  than it should withdraw from our land

  there must be a guarantee of peace before this happens

it  seems that many of these lebanese youth are unable to restrain  themselves from violence and unable to to realize that their actions  prolong israels stay in south lebanon

that is your opinion and the opinion of the israeli government

i agree peace guarantees would be better for all but i am addressing the problem as it stands now

hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon and will include security guarantees for both sides

my proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period

in my opinion if israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying

the israeli govt obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move

i hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs thats why i post to tpm

 if the lebanese army was able to maintain the peace then  israel would not have to be there

until it is israel prefers that  its soldiers die rather than its children

as i explained i contend that if israel does withdraw unilaterally i believe no attacks would ensue against northern israel

i also explained why i believe that to be the case

my suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides

it is unfortunate that israel does not agree with my opinion

  if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw  unilaterally from the socalled security zone before the conclusion  of the peace talks

such a move would save israeli lives  advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israels  public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations  since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in  peace and has already offered some important concessions

  israel should withdraw from lebanon when a peace treaty is  signed

not a day before

withdraw because of casualties would tell  the lebanese people that all they need to do to push israel around is  kill a few soldiers

its not gonna happen

that is too bad

 along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah  be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not  accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a  shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone  and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it

   why should israel not demand this while holding the buffer  zone

it seems to me that the better bargaining position is while  holding your neighbors land

because israel is not occupying the security zone free of charge

it is paying the price for that

once israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers lives that is my contention

if lebanon were willing to agree to  those conditions israel would quite probably have left already

 unfortunately it doesnt seem that the lebanese can disarm the  hizbolah and maintain the peace

that is completely untrue

hizbollah is now a minor force in lebanese politics

the real heavy weights are syrias allies

the govt is supported by syria

the lebanese army is over  troops and unified like never before

hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking israel proper especially after israeli withdrawal

that would draw the ire of the lebanese the syrian and the israeli govts

if israel does withdraw and such an act hizbolllah attacking israel would be akin to political and moral suicide

 lebanese resistance forces detonated a bomb under an israeli occupation patrol in lebanese territory two days ago

three soldiers were killed and two wounded

in retaliation israeli and israelibacked forces wounded  civilians by bombarding several lebanese villages

ironically the israeli government justifies its occupation in lebanon by claiming that it is necessary to prevent such bombardments of israeli villages

 congratulations to the brave men of the lebanese resistance

with every israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral bankruptcy of israels occupation and drawing attention to the israeli governments policy of reckless disregard for civilian life

 brad hernlem hernlemchessncsuedu ahhh of course

israeli morality pales in the face of charming events like the string of plorun skyjackings in the mid s remember those twa jokes and not to forget the achille lauro and however many airline bombings they have committed not to mention bombings on the streets of israel its gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any bags or containers whose origins they dont know because they could be bombs or last weeks katyusha rocket attack on northern israel by fatah those wonderful mainstream moderates with whom israel is attempting to negotiate

lets not forget the fact that more palestinians are killed by palestinians than by israelis

ahh yes those charming humanitarian death squads

ive actually seen a videotape of an interrogation dsee the documentary deadly currentsvery neutral and balancedseriouslyit was rather inquisitionesque

essentially to prove his loyalty to the cause of whichever group it was that was interogating him he had to turn in someone else or else face death in one of the many funfilled ways that the death squads love so muchbeatings dismemberment acid pouring melted plastic on the face of the guilty party and of course beheading always my favorite

did you catch the photos in the washington post a while back the execution of a collaborator

photos  one palestinian leading another at gunpoint

the collaborator on his knees the gun pointed at his temple

the executioner standing on the corpse of the collaborator shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators

wonderful justice system and lots of regard for human rights

remember black september

ok so they just tried to take over jordan big deal

im rambling now but are you getting what im saying

 dear mr beyer   it is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom  of racism and violent deragatory

  it is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial  distinction

in fact if a speach was not offensive to some its protection under freedom of speach laws would be useless

it is speach that some find questionable that must be protected be it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist

it is only through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant

that is the idea behind freedom of expression

what you find offensive might be perceived as truth by some and what they might find offensive might be your belief

it is only through free exchange of ideas and insults as the case seems to be with this channel that one can change anothers erring waysthat is why jefferson said that here we are not afraid to tolerate error so long as reason is left to combat it

from center for policy research cpr subject ten questions about israel i would be thankful if any of you who live in israel could help to provide  accurate answers to the following specific questions

these are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me

  questions omitted   elias davidsson iceland email eliasismenntis funny you should mention it but ive heard these questions time and again also

da armenia is involved in fighting with azarbaijan

it is armenian da soldiers from mainland armenia that are shelling towns in azarbaijan

 well this is your opinion 

are you related to arromdian of asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle

if you feel that you can simply act as a fascist armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed

this is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist but a fact

this time fascist xsoviet armenian government will not get away with the genocide of  azeri men women and children

not a chance

 the sunday times  march   morgues fill as azeris head for allout war   thomas goltz the first to report the massacre by armenian soldiers in the worst violence since the breakup of the soviet union reports from agdam   khojaly used to be a barren town with empty shops and treeless dirt roads

yet it was still home to thousands of people who in happier times tended fields and flocks of geese

last week it was wiped off the map

   as sickening reports trickled in to the azerbaijani border town of agdam and the bodies piled up in the morgues there was little doubt that khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been the site of the most terrible massacre since the soviet union broke apart

  i was the last westerner to visit khojaly

that was in january and people were predicting their fate with grim resignation

zumrut ezoya a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the town called her community sitting ducks ready to get shot

she and her family were among the victims of the massacre on february 

  the armenians have taken all the outlying villages one by one and the government does nothing

balakisi sakikov  a father of five said

next they will drive us out or kill us all said dilbar his wife

the couple their three sons and three daughters were killed in the assault as were many other people i had spoken to

  it was close to the armenian lines we knew we would have to cross

there was a road and the first units of the column ran across then all hell broke loose

bullets were raining down from all sides

we had just entered their trap

 the azeri defenders picked off one by one

survivors say that armenian forces then began a pitiless slaughter firing at anything moved in the gullies

a video taken by an azeri cameraman wailing and crying as he filmed body after body showed a grizzly trail of death leading towards higher forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge from the armenians

 the armenians just shot and shot and shot said omar veyselov lying in hospital in agdam with sharapnel wounds

i saw my wife and daughter fall right by me

 people wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the loved ones

some vented their fury on foreigners  where is my daughter where is my son 

wailed a mother

raped

butchered

lost

 azerbaijan has said as many as  refugees were killed as they tried to flee

the armenians have denied this saying the civilians were caught in crossfire

  source the times  march 

corpses litter hills in karabakh anatol lieven comes under fire while flying with azerbaijani forces to investigate the alleged mass killings of refugees by armenian troops as we swooped low over the snowcovered hills of nagornokarabagh we saw the scattered corpses

apparently the refugees had been shot down as they ran

an azerbaijani film of the places we flew over shown to journalists afterwards showed dozens of corpses lying in various parts of the hills

the azerbaijanis claim that as many as  have died in a mass killing of azerbaijanis fleeing from the town of khodjaly seized by armenians last week

a further  are believed to be wounded frozen to death or missing

seven of us squatted in the cabin of an azerbaijani m attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings

suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing and the helicopter rocked sharply

we swung round and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire

we had been fired on from an armenian antiaircraft post

we swung round again tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley

the brown earth swooped around our heads the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground

our cannon fired repeated blasts

later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of nagornokarabakh to pick up some of the dead

we had in fact been attacked both by ground fire and by an armenian helicopter

i had seen the armenian helicopter intermittently through the window its cannons firing but had thought  mistakenly  that it was on our side

our group of western journalists had embarked on a searchandrescue flight that had become a combat mission

our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two m soviet attack helicopters in the azerbaijani service nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour

our party was in the second crocodile

the civilian helicopters job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings

the attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary

the operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the soviet armed forces because our pilot was a russian officer

an azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former soviet military helicopters and their pilots fighting for azerbaijan

they have signed contracts to fly for us he said

the helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brotherofficer of our russian pilot but fighting for the armenians

we had taken off just before pm on saturday from agdam airfield an heated for the armeniancontrolled mountains of karabakh a sheer white wall in the distance

the civilian helicopter picked up four corpses and it was during this and a previous mission that an azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides

we then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards azerbaijani lines

azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain  and safety  gazed up at us as we passed

back at the airfield in agdam we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up

two old men a small girl were covered with blood their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis

they had been shot

what did our russian pilot think of the tragedy our close shave and the war in nagornokarabakh

he gave us cheerful grin politely declined to answer ques tions and marched off to his dinner

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

ohanus appressian   in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul

in article aprsolctrcolumbiaedu denizmandolinctrcolumbiaedu deniz akkus writes   well this is your opinion 

 of course it is

 turkish azeris can bark all they want since the above is untrue

however  i am sure you guys would have never brought up armenias involvement if  karabakhiarmenians had had heavy losses

 and this is your opinion

it is not any more valid due to repeated capital letters and words such as untrue never etc

 read what 

the new york times  that is publishing antiarmenian  articles

nop i have my resources

look everyone knows how aggressive  turksazeris have been in the past

armenians are not gona sit  around and watch fire works by azeris taught by turks

so armenians are justified in aggression since supposedly turks have been aggressive in the past

i dont follow your logic

da i dont wish to get into the cyprus discussion

turkey had the right to   not a chance 

you can not convince me based on your reasonsthat  your government did the right thing to invade cyprus

i have said that i dont wish to get into cyprus discussion and did not give any reasons for turkeys involvement

i also am not trying to convince you of anything seeing no reason to waste any time da lastly why is there not a socculturearmenia

i vote yes for it

da after all it is now free

  well i am not in the position to agree or disadree with you

  i am serious

lets get socculturearmenia started and have some peace of mind

 abzvirginiaedu andi beyer writes    first of all i never said the holocaust

i said before the   holocaust

im not ignorant of the holocaust and know more   about nazi germany than most people maybe including you

  uh oh

the first sign of an argument without meritthe stating of ones  qualifications in an area

if you know something about nazi germany  show it

if you dont shut up

simple as that

   i dont think the suffering of some jews during wwii   justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government

any   attempt to call civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is   not appreciated

  all jews suffered during wwii not just our beloved who perished or were  tortured

we all suffered

second the namecalling was directed against  you not civillibertarians in general

your namedropping of a fancy  sounding political term is yet another attempt to cite qualifications  in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument

go  back to the minors junior

all humans suffered emotionally some jews and many others suffered physically

it is sad that people like you are so blinded by emotions that they cant see the facts

thanks for calling me names it only assures me of what kind of ignorant people i am dealing with

i included your letter since i thought it demonstrated my point more than anything i could write

 in article aprthundermcrcimmcgilledu hasanmcrcimmcgilledu writes     in article aprnysernetorg asteinnysernetorg alan stein writes    i guess hasan finally revealed the source of his claim that israel    diverted water from lebanonhis imagination

       alan h stein asteinisraelnysernetorg   mr waterhead   i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers in fact i said that   israel went into southern lebanon to make sure that no   water is being used on the lebanese   side so that all water would run into jordan river where there   israel will use it head

  of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more  difficult

you have not bothered to substantiate this in  any way

basil do you know of any evidence that would support  this

i agree with shai there are many references to israeli plans on the litani river but i have yet to find hard evidence

i had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the un to study the litani river it is still in draft form

the israeli govt also commissioned a study on the river that was done by dr ben wolfe

the litani starts in the bekaa valley in lebanon flows southward then west across south lebanon and discharges into the mediterranean near the city of tyre

there are other rivers such as the hasbani and the wazzani that start in lebanese territory than join the jordan river

the most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the litani into these then the water would flow naturally into the lac de houle

but there is no evidence of any diversion structure which would need to be at least  km long

the area is mountainous inaccessible and occupied by israel so i have not seen any independent reports of the existence of any diversion structure there

another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells

it is also rumored that israe has  m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the israeli side of the border

if such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate high energy costs and the lebanese and israeli govt should agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on regional issues

the fact that we have been at war all this time has led to the current state of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is completely unregulated

 belgrade yugoslavia upi  greek prime minister constantine mitsotakis visited the capital of the serbiamontenegro federation tuesday in an apparent attempt to press serbian leaders into accepting the international plan to end the war in bosniaherzegovina

so far so good  i came here as an old friend of this countryto help in solving the burning problem of bosniaherzegovina mitsotakis told reporters after talking for two hours with president slobodan milosevic of serbia

old friend whatever  i did not come here to discuss any particular plan

i came to hear the serbian point of view he said adding that serbia is sincerely trying to bring peace to the region

that is a great attitude for someone who wants to pressure the serbs to accept a peace plan that gives them most of the territory they got by force and terror

 milosevic said that serbia and greece had practically identical views on the bosnian war which started late in march  when the this is a good thing to hear

anybody wondering why serbia is not really under any boycott

anybody remembers the gulf war

did saddam kill  people and rape  women

 in an effort to pressure milosevic who is considered to be the main patron of serbian territorial conquest in bosnia the un security council has threatened to impose new sanctions against serbia and montenegro and implement a nofly zone over bosnian skies

still in the threatening stage maybe when there is no more bosnians the un will lift the arms embargo on them

military intervention

that is reserved for muslim countries

now hear this  after meeting milosevic mitsotakis had separate talks with radovan karadzic the leader of bosnian serbs

 i encouraged mr karadzic to proceed with his efforts to achieve a just peace in the region he said

 we are ready to play a positive role in the balkans said mitsotakis

real positive i might add in favor of his old freinds of course

 karadzic said that he was honored to meet the greek premier

 greeks are not one sided and they do not tend to condemn only one you bet they are not

side in this war said karadzic

 we will continue to negotiate on all levels he said

 before meeting with milosevic mitsotakis had talks with president dobrica cosic of the federal yugoslav union of serbia and montenegro and patriarch pavle the head priest of the serbian orthodox church

anybody is still convinced that this is not a religious war

a psychopath like karadzik is considered a peacelover of course he sent  muslims to permanent peace

with the blessings of patriarch pavle

  the hamas way of death   following is a transcript of a recruitment and training  videotape made last summer by the qassam battalions the military as opposed to israels many ways of death

using bombers and artillery against lebanese towns and villages

using fire arms and lethal variants of tear gas and rubber coated bullets against stone throwers

using tanks and antitank missiles against homes after a  minute evacuation warning

using shin bits reasonable physical pressure in interrogation

and more

not counting of course past practices such as the bombardment of beirut in  the bombing of the egyptian school of bahrelbakar and the abuzabal factory in  the downing of the libyan airliner full of egyptian passengers near the same time

overseeing the maronite massacre in sabra and shatilla

that is of course besides numerous massacres by irgun and other gangs during the british mandate period

ironically the same oped page in the nyt times from which the naftaly copied this article was running another article next to it by am rosenthall blaming bosnian muslims for their own genocide by effectively saying that it is stupid to seek independence if independence will bring your people slaughter

but what else would one expect from mr rosenthall who never wasted a chance to bash arabs or muslims

alaa zeineldine



so did the turks kill the armenians

so did the jews kill the germans

you even make armenians laugh

an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at least  percent of the population of that republic

the memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and eyewitnessed these atrocities was published in the us in  with the title men are like that

other references abound

rachel a bortnick  the jewish times  june   

or was it the armenians who massacred the turks

yes

to be exact armenians slaughtered

the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the area of transcaucasia to over  square miles

the estimated population of the entire region in  was  of whom   percent were armenian   percent georgian and   percent moslem

of the latter group  were tatars

paradoxically barely onethird of transcaucasias armenians lived in the erevan guberniia where the christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds

erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only  armenians as compared to  moslems

by the time of the russian census of  however the armenians had established a scant majority  percent in the guberniia it had risen by  to  percent or  of the  inhabitants

this impressive change in the provinces ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic a solid block of  tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia

see also map 

historic armenia and map 

administrative subdivisions of transcaucasia

in   percent turk

we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination

our troops surrounded village after village

little resistance was offered

our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work

some of the tartars escaped of course

they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey

the rest were killed

and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages

they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead

ohanus appressian men are like that p

from dzkcsbrownedu danny keren subject re desertification of the negev organization brown university department of computer science lines  this is nonsense

i lived in the negev for many years and i can say for sure that no beduins were moved or harmed in any way

on the contrary their standard of living has climbed sharply many of them now live in rather nice permanent houses and own cars

there are quite a few beduin students in the bengurion university

there are good friendly relations between them and the rest of the population

all the beduins i met would be rather surprised to read mr davidsons poster i have to say

danny keren

 when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that  the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate  and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on  the ground of occupied territories

   no i am not neglecting that im merely asking you whether the existance  of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals  right   to live a as you so eloquently put it human right

we can get back to the   question of which law should be used in the territories later

also you have   not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights

   first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens  in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation  of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically  revokes the right of for its military men

clearly occupation is an  undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate

  ok let me rephrase the question

i have repeatedly asked you if the  israelis have less human rights than the palestinians well if you just waited for  more lines you would have read my statement secondly surely israeli have human rights but   and if so why

because they belong to the human race or do you disagree on that too 

 from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred  that you thought so

together with the above statement i then assumed that the  reason was the actions of the state of israel

re your statement of  occupation id like you to define the term so i dont have to repeat this  drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary

  secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to  protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing  palestinean human rights

  im sorry but the above sentence does not make sense

please rephrase it

i donot know about you but it makes full sense to me

israelis are being killed because israel is occupying  let israel withdraw and israeli blood will be saved

it isnot the palestineans who undermined the right of life of israelis but it is israel which occupied and exposed the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of  

more generally the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada and i had previously posted a long article about this issue whom i finished by an open question suppose the intifada stops what is the motive for israel to withdraw 

donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit

everybody in the world looks and hopes for peace so why isnot there any

hope of peace is necessary but not sufficient motive

  if a state can deprive all its citizens of human rights by its actions then   tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all

   because not all states are like israelas oppressiveas ignorantor as tyrant

  oh ok

so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others

 does the name of hama sound familiar

or how about the kurds in iraq and  turkey

 how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in  the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia

 do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you

as for the arabian countries their problems are an arabian concern

the arabian people can deal with it themselves if the west doesnot intervene

as for serbs i donot think that those fucked up rapists excuse my language but it really hurts as much if i was in bosnia itself arenot humans

those surely came from outer space or something

no human can allow himself to see such attrocities than to participate in

   and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem

    the question is not which system would solve the me problem

why 

because   any system can solve it

  the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine

    i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for     all people involved

i assumed that was obvious but i wont repeat that   mistake

now that i have straightened that out im eagerly awaiting your   reply

  so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights

 i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

  no im agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper  would probably lead to disaster for both parties

if thats what you refer  to as the israeli solution then so be it

ok   joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization   said it best when writing in his diary in    between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both   peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal       of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country

  the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of   the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than   to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be   left only after this transfer will the country be able to   absorb the millions of our own brethren

there is no other way out

  davar  september    courtesy of marc afifi     just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to   getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas   charter thats the english translations if you have other information id   be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to   a private paper even older

im not going to get into the question if he   wrote the above but its fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have   their share of fanatics

guess what

those are not the people that will   make any lasting peace in the region

more deleted stuff   exactly you are right

i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment  is full with men like joseph weitz

  oh

have you met with them personally to read their diaries

fascinating

 what do you do for a living

   we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which

    well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the   imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem 

    i think that is fair enough 

    no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve   the problem

you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

  above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by    any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would  resolve it justly

  an unjust solution would be a nonsolution per definition no

my definition is the same as yours but one has to look into the world politics

in politics a solution doesnot imply just solution

 you said the following   for all a it holds that a have property b

 there exists an a such that property b does not hold

  thus either or both statements must be false

   guess where that takes your logic

to nevernever land

  you are proving yourself as a  

first you understood what i meant but then  you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic

 too bad for you the master of wisdom

  i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning

 since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out  before you started using your statements to prove a point or so

 am i then to assume you are not logical

it seems that it was problem in the definition of solution

i think a solution must be just because otherwise it would never be lasting

however when politicians say a solution they donot mean a just solution but just a solution

  the greatest problem of zionism is arab children

  rabbi shoham

    oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are   a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit

  why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in   if you were a zionists

if you believe in zionist codes and acts  well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said  yes zionism is racism

 if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism

 if you are not zionist why are you bothered then

you should join me in  condemning these racist zionist codes and acts

  any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all  individuals by a statement of an individual

if you use the same  methods that you credit zionists with then where does that place you

  oh by the way id advice you not to assume anything about my loyalties

 i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman but ill try as  long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people

 by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel  the leaders of israel political andor religious or the jews in  general

if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible  instead

how would you feel if we started condemning you personally  based on the bombings in egypt

  jonas flygare hasan

 problem    my father told me the following story

during the famous wars between the  armenians and the persians prince zaurak kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds

three times in a single month he attacked the persian troops

 the first time he struck down half of the persian army

the second time  pursuing the persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers

the third  time he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army

the persians who were  still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to nakhichevan

and so from  this remainder find how many persian soldiers there were before the massacre

  answer a  a    i thought the implication was that the prince destroyed one fourth of the remaining persian troops on the second round and then  of those remaining on the third round

this would mean answer a          a  

henrik the armenians in nagarnokarabagh are simply defending their henrik rights to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are henrik invading their homeland

he homeland

first nagarnokarabagh was armenians homeland today he fizuli lacin and several villages in azerbadjan he are their homeland

cant you see the he the great armenia dream in this

with facist methods like he killing raping and bombing villages

the last move was the he blast of a truck with  kurdish refugees trying to he escape the from lacin a city that was given to the kurds he by the armenians

nagornokarabakh is in azerbaijan not armenia

armenians have lived in nagorno karabakh ever since there were armenians

armenians used to live in the areas between armenia and nagornokarabakh and this area is being used to invade nagorno karabakh

armenians are defending themselves

if azeris are dying because of a policy of attacking armenians then something is wrong with this policy

attacking

who is attacking who

even the country you live inusa have condemned armenia for its attacking

and you start to say that the attackers are the azeris

armenians have lived in nagorno karabakh ever since there were armenians 

azeris have lived in nagorno karabakh ever since there were azeris dont come with nonsence there is no reason to attack a people just because a man called gorbatjov and co gave the freedom to the people in this area

if i recall correctly it was stalin who caused all this problem with land in the first place not the armenians

its easy for people like you to blame history

the were a lot of indians living in usa

there is no reason for these indians to attack the american people and sayit was the fault of the government of germany and great britain because they made people come to our place armenians lived in harmony with the azeris until gorbatjov and co gave freedom to the people in karabag then the armenians started to kill rape and torture the azeris not only in karabag but also noe in azerbadjan henrik however i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane henrik to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one henrik that happened last summer

turkey searched an american plane henrik carrying humanitarian aid bound to armenia

he dont speak about things you dont know  us

cargo planes he were heading to armenia

when the turkish authorities he announced that they were going to search these cargo he planes  of these planes returned to its base in germany

he  of these planes were searched in turkey

the content of he of the other  planes

not hard to guess is it

it was sure not he humanitarian aid what story are you talking about

planes from the us have been sending aid into armenian for two years

i would not like to guess about what were in the  planes in your story i would like to find out

he search turkish planes

you dont know what you are talking about

he turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons he to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan he it self not the karabag province

so why search a plane for weapons he since its content is announced to be weapons

its too bad you would want turkey to start a war with armenia

thats what i dont want you couldnt imagine the result of a war

so france greece and usa wants to start fighting with azerbadjan

they give a lot more weapons to the armenians without saying it thats no secret any more

i must say that these armenian government is very shortsighted

do they think that they shall move from its neigbours when the war is over

the neighbour around will be there and armenia must live in harmony with these if they dont want a stoneage country for thats whats will happen armenia if the wars continues

look the president of turkey turgut ozal died and petrosyan the armenian presindent is now in turkey for the funeral

is it because he liked him

sure not because armenia needs its neighbours and must live with these

but armenia cant stop this war with continued ordertaking from states like france and usa

with other words if you love your people you must think twice and i wonder shoot down turkish planes with what

ohhh i forgot the armenians cant find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned countries hilmi eren stockholm university sweden

in article aprdasharvardedu adamendoruucp adam shostack writes in article aprbnrca zbibbnrca writes  imho it does not really matter who started any individual battle within the arabsisreal war context

the real question is whowhat started the war

does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of israel on arab land 

  huh

a war was started when several armies invaded israel vowing to drive the jews into the sea

most jews wanted to live in peace and the arabs who stayed in israel were granted citizenship

 it depends entirely on how you define war

the actual fighting largely predates the arab invasions  after all deir yassin happened in midapril well before the arab invasion

as i have said elsewhere lt col lorch has said that hagana forces were fighting well before the arabs invaded as in months before

as for jews wanting to live in peace that to is entirely arguable

i think it is easy enough to show that the labour party leadership had no such intention at all

as for the arabs who stayed dont you mean those who were not expelled

even some of those who did stay were not granted citizenship but expelled after the fighting had stopped anyway

 joseph askew  how do you define war

do seiges and constant attacks on villiages count as acts of war or is that only when the jews do them

january  arab liberation army attacks kfar szold  men attack kfar etzion  miles south of jerusalem after cutting off the supply lines to it

attacks on yehiam western galilee and kibbutz tirat tzvi

by midmarch the jewish settlements in the negev had been cut off from land links with the rest of the jewish population

the etzion group of villiages near hebron had been cut off while  members of a convoy trying to supply yehiam were slaughtered cutting off the villiage

jerusalem was under seige being cut off from its supply route from tel aviv the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side of that road to this day in memoriam

by this time  jews had been killed

of course this isnt war since its only the arabs attacking

just like last week when the fatah launched katyusha rockets against northern israel

where does uprising end and war begin

will it still be intifadah when the plo brings in tanks

i said before the    holocaust

im not ignorant of the holocaust and know more    about nazi germany than most people maybe including you

    uh oh

the first sign of an argument without meritthe stating of ones   qualifications in an area

if you know something about nazi germany   show it

if you dont shut up

simple as that

     i dont think the suffering of some jews during wwii    justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government

any    attempt to call civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is    not appreciated

    all jews suffered during wwii not just our beloved who perished or were   tortured

we all suffered

second the namecalling was directed against   you not civillibertarians in general

your namedropping of a fancy   sounding political term is yet another attempt to cite qualifications   in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument

go   back to the minors junior

 all humans suffered emotionally some jews and many  others suffered physically

it is sad that people like you are  so blinded by emotions that they cant see the facts

thanks  for calling me names it only assures me of what kind of  ignorant people i am dealing with

not this time enis

furthermore a new generation has risen  equipped with a deep sense of commitment politically mature and conscious who determinedly pursue the turkish cause through all necessary means ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle

in other words what we have is a demand from the fascist government of xsoviet armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people

the crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination of the muslim population in the soviet republic of armenia karabag bosnia and herzegovina is an islamic holocaust comparable to the extermination of

tovfik kasimov  azeri leader  september   todays ethnic cleansing policies by the serbian dictatorship against croatians and muslims of yugoslavia as well as the soviet republic of armenias against the muslim population of neighboring azerbaijan are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide perpetrated by the armenian government  years ago against the turkish and kurdish muslims and sephardic jews living in these lands

ten questions about arab countries  i would be thankful if any of you who live in arab countries could help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions

these are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me



is it true that many arab countries dont recognize israeli nationality 

that people with israeli stamps on their passports cant enter arabic countries



is it true that arabic countries such as jordan and syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from  until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be



is it true that arab countires refused to sign the chemical weapon convention treaty in paris in 



is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets 

a

is it true that some arab countries like syria harbor nazi war criminals and refuse to extradite them

b

is it true that some arab countries like saudi arabia prohibit women from driving cars



is it true that jews who reside in the muslim countries are subject to different laws than muslims



is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of entire jewish communites forced to flee by antijewish riots



is it true that israels prime minister y rabin signed a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign



is it true that syrian jews are required to leave a  deposit before leaving the country and are no longer allowed to emmigrate despite promises made by hafez assad to george bush



is it true that jews in muslim lands are required to pay a special tax for being jews



is it true that intercontinental hotel in jerusalem was built on a jewish cemetary with roads being paved over grave sites and gravestones being used in jordanian latrines



is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased leading questions

a

is it less appropriate if information implied in mr davidssons questions is highly misleading

  from center for policy research cpr  subject ten questions about israel    ten questions to israelis     i would be thankful if any of you who live in israel could help to  provide  accurate answers to the following specific questions

these are  indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by  people around me

  

is it true that the israeli authorities dont recognize  israeli nationality 

and that id cards which israeli citizens  must carry at all times identify people as jews or arabs not as  israelis 

although the hebrew expression leum is used the id card specifically states on the nd page ezrachut yisrealit israeli citizen

this is true for all israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity

in the united states most official forms have race caucasian black amerindian etc   

is it true that the state of israel has no fixed borders  and that israeli governments from  until today have refused to  state where the ultimate borders of the state of israel should be  

 funny i have a number of maps and all of them have fixed borders

 

is it true that israeli stocks nuclear weapons 

if so  could you provide any evidence 

probably yes

so what 

  

is it true that in israeli prisons there are a number of  individuals which were tried in secret and for which their  identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are  state secrets 

apart from mordechai vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there was one other espionage case the nutty professor at the nes ziona biological institute who was a kgb

mole who was tried in camera

i wouldnt exactly call it a state secret

the trial was simply tried behind closed doors

i hate to disappoint you but the united states has tried a number of espionage cases in camera

  

is it true that jews who reside in the occupied  territories are subject to different laws than nonjews

 not jews

israeli citizens

jordanian law is in effect in the west bank but the knesset passed a law that israeli law would be binding on israeli citizens residing in the west bank

these citizens could be jews israeli muslims druze or israeli christians

it has nothing to do with religion

 

is it true that jews who left palestine in the war   to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return while their  christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return 

anyone who was registered jew muslim christian could return

you might be confusing this with the census taken in june  on the west bank after the six day war

in this instance if the arab was not physically present he couldnt reside on the west bank eg

if he had been visting jordan

  

is it true that israels prime minister y rabin signed  an order for ethnical cleansing in  as is done today in  bosniaherzegovina 

 no

not even if you drowned him in bourbon scotch or brandy   

is it true that israeli arab citizens are not admitted as  members in kibbutzim

not true

although a minority there are some israeli arabs living on kibbutzim

on the other hand at my age  i wouldnt be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me

not that i would be so thrilled to do so in the first place

the kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria

many israeli jews are not admitted

  

is it true that israeli law attempts to discourage  marriages between jews and nonjews 

the religious status quo in israel has marriage and divorce handled by the religious courts

the rabbanut handles marriage and divorce for jews the muslim shaaria courts are for muslims the christian denominations have their religious courts and the druze have their own courts

the entire religious establishment jewish muslim druze christian wants to keep it that way

  

is it true that hotel hilton in tel aviv is built on the  site of a muslim cemetery 

i believe its adjacent to a former muslim cemetary

from what i heard and id like to get feedback from muslins on the net sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by jews

the current israeli ministry of trade and industry on agron road in jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that was built by arabs in the s on the site of an arab cemetary

dont waste bandwidth please

you know how picky us non jews can be

ha ha



 i complained about the us taking the point in bosnia when the europeans  should be doing it  ken says the bosnians are morally superior to the serbians this implies both sides are equal

true it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim but that does not mean that victims do not exist

yes victims exist

there are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day

i think on balance intervention would create more victims including american ones

since the first responsibility of the us government is to protect americans i think they serve that role best by staying away from bosnia and other regional conflicts

would you in wwii have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the jews and the germans

of course not

the jews were not trying to carve a territory out of germany either and except for smallscale resistance and a few larger uprisings did not have an army or a government

these people have been butchering each other for centuries

when one side wins and gets what it wants it will stop

 yes but both sides want different things

the muslims chiefly want to not be ethnic cleansed

the serbians want to ethnic cleanse the muslims

it is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent

i see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power  driving away andor eliminating the population of an area they want to control

the us tried basically that in vietnam the iraqis in kuwait the israelis in palestine south africa etc etc etc

it sucks its ugly and its saddening

but it is not genocide

it is not my impression that the serbs want to eliminate every muslim in yugoslavia

i still say the bosnians are getting their asses kicked they should surrender and evacuate the areas they cant hold

 i said the fixation on bosnia is due to it being in a european country  rather than the third world  i recall before we did anything for somalia apparent leftwingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to bosnia than to somalia was because the somalis are thirdworlders who americans consider unworthy of help

they suddenly shut up when the us decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory

i am a staunch republican btw

the irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on vietnam has not escaped me

i was opposed to us intervention in somalia for the same reasons although clearly it was not nearly as risky

for that matter this theory of yours suggests that americans should want to help the serbs

after all theyre christian and the muslims are not

if the desire to intervene in bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us why does everyone want to help the side that is less like us

especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think

well one thing you have to remember is the press likes a good story

good for business dont you know

and btw not everyone wants to help the side that is less like us

i never said the two sides were morally equivalent i said neither one is innocent

there are just too many good reasons to stay away  the europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders in any way we do it

put another way we have no assistance to offer the europeans which they do not already possess themselves

it is not good to promote the idea in anyones mind that the united states is responsible for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world

clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure

full stop

it is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish nor that it would necessarily help the victims

it is not clear what the goal is and at what point any commitment could be ended

 i have just started reading the articles in this news group

there seems to be an attempt by some members to quiet other members with scare tactics

i believe one posting said that all postings by one person are being forwarded to his server who keeps a file on him in hope that appropriate action might be taken

 i dont know where you guys are from but in america such attempts to curtail someones first amendment rights are not appreciated

here we let everyone speak their mind regardless of how we feel about it

take your fascistic repressive ideals back to where you came from

it would be nice if as you rightly point out the inherent value of freedom of speech discussion would also deal with the allto frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do occur

there are situations where a few extremely vocal and usually radical people do drive people away effectively stifle all other opposing views and generally take over

clearly the purpose behind such actions is to deprive others of their freedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of the media form in question

while freedom of speech is to be valued this is not

how would you suggest that this sort of reoccuring problem be alleviated

more particularly how can this be controlled within the structure of these newsgroups

  the incidents occurred in the town of khan younis and involved soldiers of  the golani brigade who have been at the centre of housetohouse raids for  palestinian activists during the closure which was imposed on the strip and  occupied west bank

a negative side effect is  that my bird now has a somewhat warped view of the mideast

let me clearify mr turkish armenia is not getting itchy

she is simply letting the world know that she will no longer sit there quiet and let turks get away with their famous tricks

armenians do remember of the turkish invasion of the greek island of cypress while the world simply watched

 in article aprthundermcrcimmcgilledu hasanmcrcimmcgilledu writes     in article aprnysernetorg asteinnysernetorg alan stein writes    i guess hasan finally revealed the source of his claim that israel    diverted water from lebanonhis imagination

       alan h stein asteinisraelnysernetorg   mr waterhead   i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers in fact i said that   israel went into southern lebanon to make sure that no   water is being used on the lebanese   side so that all water would run into jordan river where there   israel will use it head

  of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more  difficult

you have not bothered to substantiate this in  any way

basil do you know of any evidence that would support  this

  i can just imagine a news report from ancient times if hasan  had been writing it

  newsflash  cairo ap ancient press

israel today denied egypt acces to the red  sea

in a typical display of israelite agressiveness the leader of  the israelite slave revolt former prince moses parted the red sea

 the action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment

 egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been  denied their livelihood by the parted waters

pharaohs brave charioteers  were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the  red sea to return to their normal state

unfortunately they suffered  heavy casualties while doing so

hehehe

btw does the litani river not flow west and not south

i think that its waters stay entirely within lebanese territory and so what hasan says about the jordan river makes no sense in any case

the hasbani river on the other hand flows into the jordan if i am not mistaken

through private contributions on federal land

your hatemongering article is devoid of current and historical fact intellectual content and social value

down the toilet it goes  and we all know what an unbiased source the nyt is when it comes to things concerning israel

neither the times nor the trained seals who have responded thus far seem to recognize the statement that these private funds were all tax exmpt

in otherwords american taxpayers put up at least  of the money

and finalyy how does federal land mitigate the offensiveness of this alien monument dedicated to perpetuating pitty and the continual flow of tax money to a foreign entity

that federal land and tax money could have been used to commerate americans or better yet to house homeless americans

 in article bimacsbitnet ehrlichbimacsbitnet gideon ehrlich writes      what are the borders the islamic world dreams about 

  the islamic world dreams of being the whole planet but not by kicking  the current inhabitant out we rather deam of the day everybody converts

 if jews had the same dream i would not feel threatened a bit

contrary to what the protocols of zion crowd might suggest judaism does not have any such goals

 islamic readers i am waiting to your honest answer

  i want also a honest answer from zionists for the following questions   why do jews who dont even believe in god as is the case with many  of the founders of secular zionism have a right in palestine more  than the inhabitants of palestine just because god gave you the land

the question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer

i am going to provide one from my own current perspective not a historical one

currently as a nonobservant jewisraeliamerican my own feeling is that jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in palestine or israel than the palestinians or israelis both arab and jew do

with regard to jewish israelis they should have the same rights in israel as do all other israelis

 why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of  the inhabitants are not jews and do not want to be part of israel

who are them

if by them you mean the nonreligious jews i think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious

the other part of the problem is to my knowledge not that the palestinians dont want to be a part of israel as much as they would accept for the most part being full citizens of israel with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded israeli citizens

what they object to is the current limbo in which they find themselves

 i recently read that during bill clintons campaign he stated  that if elected he would immediately recognize jerusalem as  israels capital

according to the article mr clinton  reaffirmed this after winning the presidency

however  during recent talks with president mubarak secretary of  state christopher stated that the status of jerusalem  will be a final matter of discussion between the parties

  now i dont want to start a big discussion over the status  of jerusalem

all i want to know is if anyone can  authenticate mr clintons statements with dates places etc

 this would be one of the results of us backed peace

center for regional studies lines  accounts of antiarmenian human rights violations in azerbaijan  prelude to current events in nagornokarabakh     they grab papa carry him into one room and mamma and me into another

  they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs

  they start tearing my clothes right there in front of mamma

i dont   remember where they went what they did or how much time passed

i had   the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my   clothes all at the same time i dont even know what i said

the   atrocities started

i was savagely raped in that room

they argued among   themselves who would go first

    deposition of karine karina grigorevna m  born  secretarytypist azsantekmontazh trust sumgait construction and installation administration secretary of the smu komsomol organization resident at building b apartment  microdistrict no

sumgait azerbaijan on the th my sister marina and i went to the movies the seven oclock show at the theater that is across from the city party committee about  yards away

the sk theater

they were showing an argentinian film the abyss

before the film we noticed about  to  people standing near the podium at the city party committee but they were silent theres no conversation whatsoever and we couldnt figure out what was going on

that is we knew it was about karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we didnt know

we bought our tickets

there were  or  people in the theater

this was a very small number for that large movie theater

the film started

about  minutes later they stopped the film

a crowd burst in

about  people

they came up onto the stage

well mostly they were young people from  to  years old

they demanded that an armenian woman come up onto the stage

they used foul language and said that they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to armenian girls

i thought thats what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically

marina and i were sitting together

i told her to move over there were some russian girls sitting nearby

so that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not marina

it got quiet  or  girls jumped up to run out but the door was closedits only opened at the end of the showand they returned to their seats

everyone in the theater was looking at one another russians azerbaijanis people of various nationalities

but no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound

they were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave

some guy a really fat one says ok weve scared them enough lets leave

they leave slowly pompously

it seemed to me that those people were not themselves

either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart

then it was all over as though nothing had happened at all

the film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive

we could barely sit to the end

so it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark 





marina and i were walking home lenin street thats the center of town

lenin street was packed just packed with young people

they were shouting something about karabagh and something about armenians

we werent especially listening because the way we were feeling we didnt know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway

public transportation wasnt running

incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing there

the director of the movie theater was looking at the doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass

everything was broken

he stood there grief stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot

well since he looked more or less calm i decided that nothing all that super serious had happened

we went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away

we didnt want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might happen

we flagged down a cab but the driver didnt want to take us

we told him we live near the bus station and he said hed take us to the bus station and not a yard farther

i said well ok 





so we got into the cab and managed to get there

something incredible was happening at the bus station

there was a traffic jam

public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting karabagh theyre not going to give up karabagh

i go home and tell my family whats going on and theres immediate panic in the house

mamma says what should we do

like the end had come they were going to come kill us thats it 





somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up nothing that bad could happen

where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have

somehow we manage to calm mamma down

and we went to bed

but no one could sleep

everyone made as though nothing had happened

that was on saturday

in short the day went by

we didnt go anywhere and didnt call our relatives

no one did anything

because 





life goes on

that day i realized something was approaching but what exactly i couldnt guess

on the th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always had

there were five of us at home mamma papa and us three sisters lyuda marina and i

my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time

we sat at home and no one went out

later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning

it all started 





they were smashing up stores

we were sitting at home and didnt know anything about it

then a girlfriend of mine lyuda zimogliad came by at around three oclock i think

we worked together we did our apprenticeships together shes a russian girl

she said that something awful was happening in town

i asked dont they want armenians

well what are they after if theyre already in that state

she says no nothing like that its just a demonstration but its awful to watch it

somehow it feels like a war has broken out

public transportation has been stopped 





the cabs the buses well its just a nightmare

then papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time 





he left the house and our neighbor aunt vera asked him where are you going

stop

there are such terrible things going on in the courtyard arent you afraid to go out

papa didnt know what she was talking about

she simply pushed him back into the entryway

he came home and told mamma

mamma said well if aunt vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on

but we didnt go see her shes a russian she lives across from us

i had to see my friend out

around five oclock i tell lyuda ok look its time for you to go its late already ill see you out

mamma says you dont need to go its too late already you can see what the situation in town is

so we decided to stay home

dinner was ready

mamma says let her eat with us then she can go

we sat down at the table

but no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that were eating

we turned on the television and the show in fairytale land was coming on

we cleared the table

we hear some noise out in the courtyard

i go out on the balcony but i cant see whats going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a story building in the way

there is mob of people 





i cant figure out whats happening

theyre shouting something looking somewhere i cant make out what is going on

i go down to a neighbor shes an azerbaijani weve been friends of her family for about  years

i go down to look from their place

i see people shouting looking at the and story buildings near the bus station

just then soldiers set upon them about  people with clubs

the mob runs off in different directions

i even see several people from our building

they are looking and laughing 





i decide that means its not all that bad if they are laughing it means theyre not killing anyone

but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers

one of the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyones kicking him 





i become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there 





cant speak 





well theyve probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is 





if each of them kicked him just once 





they took his club away from him and started to beat him with it

but it was far away and i couldnt see if he got up and left or not

i become terrified and go home and say lyuda dont go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or 





then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the story building and starts shouting something

we go out onto the balcony

all of our neighbors are also out on theirs too

everyone is standing staring

the mob is shouting and about  minutes later comes running toward our building

as it turns out at the story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in

theres only one entryway there they could stop them

they all run up to our building

mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones

they have stones and they break the windows all of them

there are very many people

we have a large courtyard and its packed with people

they spill up to the first floor so they dont crush each other

they crawl up on trees posts and garages

its just a huge cloud of people

they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian from our building

we close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway

they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar

its incomprehensible

mamma told me later that they were shouting fathers name grisha open the door weve come to kill you or something like that

i dont remember that i was spaced out kind of

mamma says into the bedroom quickly

in the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry mamma says hide there they probably wont come in there theyll ask something say something and leave

she says well tell them that we live alone here

i cant imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts 





i go to them and say that ill stand together with them ill talk with them if they come maybe i can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me i speak azerbaijani more or less and i can find out what they want

i told marina and lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister lyuda i cant remember if i told her anything or not

then 





they open the door its like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall

the crows bursts in and starts to shout get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia things like that

i tell them what has happened speak calmly

one of you tell me calmly what has happened

in azerbaijani they say get out of the apartment leave

i say ok go downstairs

well gather everything we need and leave the apartment

i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are animals

they must be stopped

the ones standing in the doorway the young guys say there are old people and one girl with them

too bad

they take two or three steps back

it seems as though i have pacified them with our exchange

then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them dont you understand what you are saying

kill them

and that was it

that was all it took

they grab papa carry him into one room and mamma and me into another

they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs

they start tearing my clothes right there in front of mamma

i dont remember where they went what they did or how much time passed

i had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time i dont even know what i said

the atrocities started

i was savagely raped in that room

they argued among themselves who would go first

later i remember i came to

i dont know if im dead or alive

someone comes in someone tall i think cleanshaven in an eskimo dogskin coat balding

he looks around at whats happening

at that instant everything stops

it seems to me that he is either their commander or 





that somehow everything depends on him

he looks and says well were done here

they are beating mamma on the head

they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs 





she loses consciousness and they decide that shes dead

papa 





was out cold

they want to throw lyuda off the balcony but they cant get the window open

apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows cant be opened

they leave her next to the window

she was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out

shes not a real strong person anyway 





he looks at me and sees that im saying something that im still twitching

well i start saying the opposite of what i should be which is humbling myself and pleading

i start shouting cursing 





they dont get any entreaty out of me

i already know that im dead why would i humble myself before anyone

and he says that if thats what i think since my tongue is so long 





maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing 





in short he commands that i be taken outside

i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda i dont know if they are alive or not

they take me outside

they are dragging me by my arms by my legs

they are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal 





while they are carrying me someone is biting me someone else is pinching me 



i dont even know

i think my god when will death come

if only it were sooner 





then 





they carry me out throw me near the entryway 





and start kicking me

i lose consciousness 





what happened after that how many people there were i dont remember

i come to after a while i dont remember how long

a neighbor is bringing me clothing

im entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me

i remember that i said the same words over and over again mamma what happened mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at

i cant make sense out of anything

there is a guy standing over me i sort of know him he served in afghanistan his name is igor he brought me indoors

when they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors even though hes smallminded he put himself at risk

igor agayev is azerbaijani he served in afghanistan

there are three brothers

the older brother also served there i think now hes stationed here on the border in armenia

igor brought me to the neighbors and then helped me come to my senses saying karina i know you calm down im not one of them

how do i know whos who and whats what

i come to and they clean me up

i was covered in blood

then papa 





i saw papa i saw mamma

and marina too 





igor was there when they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed 





marina 





lyuda said that she was russian they said well let you go we arent touching the russians go

and while they are dragging marina out she decides shes going to tell them shes azerbaijani

igor immediately grabs marinas and lyudas hands because he knows marina and knows that she is armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbors and starts pounding on the door so she will open up

she opens the door and igor pushes them in there

so they survived

my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things

while they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there

then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbors on the fourth floor the one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the door

the neighbor opened and said im not going to let you in the apartment because im afraid of them

but ill give you some stockings and well leave the building

lyuda says ill stay at your place because of whats going on they keep going up and down the stairs

it was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldnt consent

lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed 





i came to

mother was there

i cant remember my supervisors telephone number but something had to be done

somehow i remembered and called and he came to get us

he didnt have any idea what was going on

he thought we were simply afraid he didnt know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death

he came and got us and took us to the police precinct

there they looked us over

i was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe 





my supervisors name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov

hes the head of our administration

they took us there

when we were leaving i saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town

the buses were ordinary passenger buses

there were very many soldiers

we left around eleven right after eleven

if these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives 





because the crowd was moving on toward the school and what was going on there 





i think everyone know not only in sumgait not only in yerevan

because there they murdered them all one after the next without stopping

after us

i think  people died in microdistrict no

 and  to  of them were from buildings   and 

in our building one person died and one old woman died from building  thats the building in front of ours

there young azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldnt let it into their building

incidentally when we were at the neighbors marina called our relatives to warn them so they would all know what was happening

i called a aunt in microdistrict no



they have three neighbors who are armenians

i said run quickly i cant explain whats going on hide do what you can just stay alive

hide at azerbaijanis ones who wont give you away

at that moment three people came in policemen

i think they were azerbaijanis

i was in such awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again 





my forehead was badly cut and onehalf of my face was pushed out forward

no one would have thought that i would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all

i started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here havent you killed people people yet what are you doing here

one of the soldiers said dont scream at us

were muslims but were not from the sumgait police

they called in from daghestan

so at that point the daghestan police were there

when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen 





i dont know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct

i dont know what they were there for

there were also doctors from baku there

they examined lyuda and me and said these women need to go to the maternity home but we dont know what to do with the rest

so they took us and i lost contact with my parents my boss everyone

my boss said dont worry ill find you no matter where you are no matter what happens

we went to the hospital

there we were examined by a department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name was

she examined us

the ambulance was from baku i figured out that the sumgait ambulances hadnt done anything they didnt respond to any calls

people called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life

that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened for she became quite glad

i even thought to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong

she looks me over and says now why are you suffering so

you dont know what your people have been doing your people did even worse things

and i think great i have to deal with her 





and i felt so bad i thought why dont i just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her

here i am in this condition and being told about something that our people did

i just didnt have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours havent already done

i stayed there

then they brought in another woman ira b she was married and she was raped in her own apartment too

there were three of us ira lyuda and 

the next morning they took lyuda and ira away

they didnt do anything to help us

this was in the old maternity home in the combined block

they didnt do anything more than examine me that was it

i didnt want any shots or tranquilizer nothing

what shots could have calmed me down

i didnt even want to look at them

i lay in the ward

either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur pose but i was alone

i was alone even though the wards were packed

that same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face was disfigured

she asked what had happened to me and i said better to ask your brother what happened theres no point in asking me your brother can better explain what happened

she fell into a faint

all the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward

then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because i was literally naked

the only thing i had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said i cant believe you put on such a short dress who are you showing off your legs to here

i went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something

people from work came and brought me something in a sack apples i think three or four pounds but i couldnt take them

i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing

i said that i couldnt take the apples and really didnt have any appetite

no one had to bring me anything

some woman took the sack 





and oh yes







then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an armenian maybe they wouldnt figure it out from looking at me

so they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen

that it would be worse

or perhaps someone was outside on the street i dont know

in any case i didnt sleep a wink that night

the next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we went

i didnt even know where they were taking me

they took me to the club where the troops were the very one i was in that illfated evening

i got off the bus

near the city party committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible

i saw a few people i knew there and that calmed me a little

i had already thought that i was the only one left

so there were five or six of us left in sumgait after that night

i still didnt know what happened to my parents they didnt come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine

i didnt know whether to believe him or not

maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the way

then i went to the club and saw a lot of people i knew

they all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking what happened what went on

two days later they came to see me from work

they were there all the time

each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me money

they did everything they could

of course im most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who didnt lose his presence of mind and who didnt change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happened

he constantly took an interest

a sincere interest from the heart 





then about two days later the secretary of the party committee came not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours is part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in our town

he made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if i sat down by myself i couldnt get up or lie down again

there was something wrong with my lungs it was hard to breathe

they examined me there several times there i lay were several doctors they all thought that 





that it must just be from all the blows i dont know

they didnt diagnose anything in particular

when i was in the maternity home i even asked 





i made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful

there was no way something inside wasnt broken my ribs 





well they took me there and took xrays and said that everything was fine

there were emergency medical workers on duty in the club

the mother of one of marinas friends was there

she was the head doctor at the sumgait childrens clinic

they had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what i needed at that moment i thought

i said that i was having great difficulty breathing i couldnt seem to get enough air something was wrong with me

they put tight bandages around my chest and waist

later i overheard some people saying that i had been cut all over

i think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut 





but i wasnt cut

they took us to the khimik boarding house

we lived there a long time

soon appeared representatives 





they were agitating

at first people would not talk to them and drove them off

one of the armenian women shouted we demand that seidov come

the response was its seidov who sent us

seidov is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers

the woman said well only see seidovs daughter have her come here well do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then well deal with you agitators

and so on

more of them said have seidov himself come

this went on day in day out

the agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our wits

then people gradually started departing for yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay

everything got on our nerves the smell the small children

there were children at the sk club children who had literally just come out of the maternity home

what were they doing in a club that didnt even have running water all the time

at first we had to pay to eat there

they even overcharged us as it turned out

on the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free

the children were ill everything stank there

well imagine about  people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 

you couldnt sit or lie down it was impossible to even move

the stench was awful

even the smallest infants took ill overnight there

i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in yerevan the infants

they have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed care

people were fainting right and left

i just dont know everyone was crying everyone 





only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together

but the women were in a constant state of panic

it seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab

it seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldnt be a single armenian left

then people went up to the attic

i didnt see them i only heard them because i was lying down and couldnt get up

i lay right on the stage we had some room there

apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas

i think they wanted to burn the theater

maybe someone saw them i didnt

i was in no condition to open my eyes

everyone was suspicious of everyone else

they would ask arent you an azerbaijani

i think i saw you somewhere i think youre an azerbaijani

they led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports relatives might be covering for each other

half of the people did not have any documents

there were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like they should have with their ids

so on the th on sunday i think the police did nothing to help us

on monday everything resumed where it had left off on block a

they didnt spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody

they killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible

they murdered the melkumian family whom i knew my mother worked with them

their daughter inlaw went to school with my older sister

they were brutally murdered

only the two daughtersinlaw survived

by a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors wouldnt take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge

she was pregnant and had two small children

this all continued on monday in block a on the th when the troops were already in the city

they murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire families

they say they didnt even know for sure if the people were armenians or not

i heard that the lezgins suffered too

im not sure myself i didnt see any lezgins who had been injured

they burned cars so its very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didnt

it was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned 





its all very hard to imagine of course i heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the btz plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift aunt razmella who also lived in microdistrict 

they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait

in the evening people who had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait and people from baku were going home from sumgait and there were students too

they were simply savagely murdered

they were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people

they stopped the buses dragged the armenians out and killed them on the spot

i didnt see it myself but i heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them

later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you cant call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it was

l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student ira g if im not mistaken

she was in the hospital a long time after that and she still cant figure out who saved her

she was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses

the fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the city

i still cant imagine how he managed to do that

i heard that from engels grigorian

he knows her apparently

well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway

she was in the hospital and singing a song in armenian and they wrote the words down and i think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape

they couldnt find the guy who saved her

he left her in someones apartment and called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she couldnt remember anyones face

i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe i had talked with him once

but i received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head

i cant remember to this day who he was

then it seems i saw the secretary of the directorates party organization where marina works

she goes to school and works she goes to night school at azi and works by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration

im the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations

we had joint meetings

i know them all ive even talked with them and he i know is from armenia

an azerbaijani but from armenia

it became obvious that many of those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia

they took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case and i iden tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize

they showed me the people who were in our apartment theyre working on our case but i cant even recognize them although it was proved that they were the ones theyre processing it somehow

they tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me

there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that

all these people all of them as much as ive heard about them and seen them they were all from kafan

the secretary of the party organization is named najaf najaf rzayev

he was there when everything started

it must have been him because i didnt recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him

all the more since i told him listen you do something because you know me

he turned away and went toward the bedroom where marina was

well you couldnt see marina anyway

there was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldnt make out anyone

all of it flew right out of my head and then gradually i became myself again at the city party committee 





there were military people there

i told them what went on and they wrote it all down

i told them his name

on march  the secretary of our first trust party organization the one were part of came to see us his name is najaf rzayev

i tell mamma if hes here despite the fact that i gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think im crazy not responsible for my words

he said what did they do to you how awful myself i hid an armenian family

then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different i wasnt at home my family and i went to baku

i said marina what is he saying

he said something totally different before

after that i didnt go to see our procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name

fedorov told me that rzayevs case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved

what are they doing with rzayev

did he prove his alibi or not

they just think that since i was hit in the head i cant say anything for sure whether it was him or not

it will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesnt have to pay for it but at the same time im afraid to say im a hundred percent sure that it was he

because no mat ter who i name they tell me no youre wrong he didnt do that that one wasnt there

all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind

who did what exactly i cant say

when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but i didnt see it because i had my eyes closed all the time

it seemed to me that i always got it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible

when they were beating my face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out

so i had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat me

a young guy  held my arms he works at the btz plant

and right nearby across the road from us block  is where all this was going on

right across the road from us

the btz dormitory is over there thats where he lives

now hes in custody they even have proved as far as i know that it was he who killed shurik gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building

one person in our building was killed it was that man

a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me

he saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didnt come over he just looked and then went into the dormitory

a while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned

that guy went and told them everything

now theyve caught him everythings been proved

now evidently theyve been beating him i dont know what theyre doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant

some young guy came to the plant and said everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten

that was it

he said the ones who wanted to went

this was at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday night

it was at night they were at the sauna together

and he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying

the others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking im going to go

but they didnt say anything to one another

he said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan that they had killed their azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of that

that guy was also born in kafan

that is certain

and marina says that the secretary of the party organization is from armenia too

from ive participated in the investigation a couple of times

im satisfied with them thus far

they summoned us and asked about what happened and every word i said was recorded

i met some guy there 





by the way he was an armenian

i said that he was in our apartment but what he did i dont know

his last name was grigorian eduard grigorian

he s from sumgait from microdistrict 

he was sentenced i think to five years not his first time

his mother is russian

i met with him at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb

they took us there and showed me photographs

there were so many photographs i think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and ive got them all confused

i say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasps

but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack

well

this guy grigorian i said he was in our apartment but he is so lightcomplected that he looks like a lezgin

i dont know what he did i cant remember

maybe he beat me or raped me

but he was in our apartment

at the kgb he started asking me pleading with me theres no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes youre like a sister to me

i took a look at him and thought my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you

but they were satisfied with my responses because i said everything without great certainty

i was there with mamma

then lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick immediately

she wanted to kill him she crawled over the table at him

she recognized him

when she came to lyuda was lying on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom

we had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters

they stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things

at that moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything

well seeing the faces hearing the voices 





two people were saying they could burn the apartment

another says why burn the apartment when ive got three kids and no place to live

so this guy was in temporary housing he didnt have anywhere to live he was from sumgait

they were sure that they would get the apartment

besides the neighbors were azerbaijani

why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijanis

thats what they said

how did they know there were azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that armenians lived there

we have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us

so they didnt set fire to our apartment

i dont know i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i was outside if someone had asked me what was happening i would have said that a civil war was going on

well maybe not civil 





but probably civil because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at a free horror film

so a civil war was going on and only the armenians were being fought

if it were a world war or something like that they would have been fighting everyone

but they only fought us

then i met some women from our building some azerbaijanis

they are crying they tell me karina we saw all of it how could it happen

theyre asking me

well i just dont know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me

i think that if it were the other way around either i wouldnt have been able to take it or i would have tried to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman did in front of our building

a woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads

two armenian families live there in her part of the building

she came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse

she came down to the entryway and said youll come in this entryway over my dead body

so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway

some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didnt even know what they were doing

i dont think thats true

they knew very well what they were doing if they didnt even lift a hand against that woman

they couldnt have cared less about her but the fact that she was an azerbaijani stopped them

they were just beasts they had smoked so much

when they came to our place they were all chewing something

i noticed everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something

i think my god maybe i just think that

maybe im losing my mind

but no theyre all chewing something

maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because 





at first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young cleanshaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration

but they were shouting something

they didnt talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there

they screamed and screamed yeah killing killing were killing the armenians

only they didnt shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary

gurun literally means kill or destroy

thats how it was

ill continue

we hid in a captains apartment hes an azerbaijani his wife is a tatar

we were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the yard

their kids knew a whole lot

this was in our part of the building on the third floor

when mamma came to and couldnt find lyuda she took papas hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they didnt pay attention because they were stealing things

apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing

mamma found the courage to 





a boy said to my mother wheres the gold

mamma said he must have been  to  years old

he even looked russian he was so fairskinned

but the azerbaijanis from armenia are fairskinned

i noticed they were all on the fair side

he shouted they were all smashing things and he asks mamma where the gold is

we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers

in a little black bag we kept everything in there

mamma doesnt really like to wear gold

she probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her

they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass

mamma thinks that the gold saved us

because they threw themselves at the gold and mamma grabbed papa who was trying to breathe

they had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face 





they had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate

mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off 





he had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood

mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them

mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said halfawake whats happened

he sees that they are bloody

mamma said at least go and find out whats happening to my daughters even if theyve burned them or murdered them at least bring the corpses

he went looking for us

at that moment lyuda was under the bed

she says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name

when he quietly called her she couldnt get out from under the bed

she wanted to get out and was calling softly

she thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting

when she got out from under the bed everyone was gone

and again 





she thought that she had lost her mind

ill never leave here never

to hell with it

it just seems that way to me ill come to eventually

but then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought lyuda down and igor carried me in from outside

or first i was brought in then lyuda i dont remember what order it happened in

and mamma said listen theyre all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other building

it had more or less calmed down where we were

whos dead whos alive we dont know

i tried to call my girlfriend

i had basically come to

mamma says listen lets go upstairs at least get a mattress or something

we dont know how long well be here

maybe they didnt burn everything

i dont get it all women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken

i tell mamma mamma what do you need any of that for

to hell with it

were alive forget the rest of it all of it

she says no lets go get at least something

maybe well leave here spend the night at someone elses

mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son alik was standing on the lookout

lie was standing there to see if they were coming

they only managed to run up there and grab something one time

he shouts come back theyre coming

they didnt have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another 





mamma got my knitting 





someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall 





someone took fathers old coveralls

the neighbor his wife mamma and papa 





marina went with them

i was in no condition to leave

neither was lyuda

we just sat

they ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs theyre dragging something again

they were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or 





there was an unfinished building over there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over there

then things more or less calmed down

i tried to call my boss

later there was more noise

we were on the third floor in a onebedroom apartment and a woman lives in the onebedroom place on the second floor asya dallakian

shes an old woman retired

she wasnt at home at that time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and her grandson is in the army

she is only very rarely in town she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant

they started pounding on her door and broke it down

she had two or three beds in there something like that shes a to yearold woman who really does not even live there

probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a television

when her grandson came she bought a television

they started wrecking everything

i started getting sick again

i think my god what is going on around here

when will this end

we turned off the lights and sat

as it turns out the people who werent afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights

we didnt know but they didnt come to where we were all the same

they all knew very well that he was a captain

he went out and closed the door and we sat in his apartment

his last name was kasumov

hes an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or other

he went out and stood at his door

they tell him comrade captain dont worry we wont harm you youre one of us

he went upstairs and they say arent you taking anything from this apartment

he says i dont need anything

and the women who were standing in the yard 





we have a basement full of water 





the women who were standing in the yard saw

those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again

the women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our property

some things were left dirty pillows two or three other things and a rug

a guy came downstairs really mad and he says wheres the rug

i just put it right here

they tell him some guy came and took it and went off toward the school

he ran off in that direction

oh

i forgot the most important point

when igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on

they just didnt tell me about it for a long time

the wife of that military man she didnt want to kill my spirit i was already dead enough

later she told me that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said wheres the girl who was here

and he became furious

the woman tells him she came to 





she didnt know what to say think something up

someone carried her off

then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family

so the woman says she came to and went to the basement

now our basement is full of water

so the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse

they took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel oil

they climbed down in there to get me

then one of them said theres so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died

she met her death in the basement

thats it we can leave no problem

i didnt know that and when i was told i felt worse

two times worse

a lot worse

so they didnt just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me 





after that we of course didnt want to live in sumgait any longer

we really didnt want to go back to our apartment

when we moved i went up there and started to quiver and shake all over because i started remembering it all

although the neighbors all sobbed it was all 





so cheap 





the people who sat in their apartments and didnt help us at a time like that

i think that they could have helped

i dont think that they were obligated to but they could have helped us

because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself

that means they could have too

it would have been enough foe one man or women to say what do you think youre doing

thats all

that would have done it

there were  apartments in our building

not one person said it

when i was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies i didnt hear anyones voice no one said what are you doing leave her alone 





mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one armenian

they would have stood up for one of their own

true they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old sick woman tried to stop the pogrom

the azerbaijanis have a custom if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed to stop immediately

the old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said if you want to go on living youll disappear into your apartment

so she left

that trick didnt work on them

even the neighbors who helped us move told me ok fine calm down forget that it happened

i said id only forget it if i told them right then that it had happened to their daughterand if that didnt have any effect on them then i would forget everything too

imagine that it happened to your sister

and no one did anything

anything

  there are many neutral human rights organizations which always report  on the situation in the ot

but as most people used to see on tv the  israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the ot

the israelis  used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters

 so this is another kind of terrorism committed by the jews in palestine

 they do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in palestine

please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killed in the ot

it is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of the intifada palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their demonstrations for the benefit of the media

having spoken to a danish reporter who covered the initfada i know of at least one case where he found out that a mass demonstration on the outskirts of gaza was setup for himself and his colleagues

when i asked whether the footage shot was sent he replied affirmatively after all it did happen

when this became the case the idf began closing sensitive trouble spots to reporters

anas there are many neutral human rights organizations which always report anas on the situation in the ot

but as most people used to see on tv the anas israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the ot

the israelis anas used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters

anas so this is another kind of terrorism committed by the jews in palestine

anas they do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in anas palestine

bring me one case where israeli soldiers deliberately killed a neutral reporter

this is another one of your wet dreams

unlike many countries israel does allow reporters in and out of the ot

that is what the problem is

if israel were a country like china then nothing would transpire from what is happening in the ot

but there seems to be a proliferation of journalists in israel always trying to show how evil the israeli monster is

arab countries dont allow journalists anywhere we have yet to hear about the massacres of kurds the destruction and annihilation of hama the killings of moslem fundamentalists in mosques in egypt and algeria etc why is it we only get state reports

how accurate are they

opinions if any 

 two percent of zero is almost nothing

instabul was called konstantinoupolis from  ad until about the s thats about  years

there many people alive today who were born in a city called konstantinoupolis

i know it doesnt make sense but since when is napoleon about sense anyway

further striking bigoted and racist attitude of certain greeks still exists in our day

most greeks insist even today that the  yearold capital of the ottoman empire should be called not by its rightful name of istanbul but by its half a millenniumold moniker conswhatever

everyone knows that new york city was once called new amsterdam but dutch people do not persist on calling it that today

the name of stalingrad too is long gone replaced by volgagrad

chinas peking traded its name for beiging long ago

ciudad trujillo of the dominican republic is now santa domingo

zimbabves old colonial capital salisburry became harrare

these changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world

but greeks are still determined on calling the turkish istanbul by the name of cons

how can one explain this total intransigence

what makes greeks so different from other mortals

yearold questionable democracy

why dont they seem to reconcile with the fact for instance that istanbul changed hands  years ago in  ad and that this predates the discovery of the new world by  years

the declaration of us independence in  will come  years later

shouldnt then half a millennium be considered enough time for cons to be called a turkish city

where is the logic in the greek reasoning if there is any

how long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization

ancient greece does not exist any more than any other  civilizations that existed on the soil of anatolia

these undereducated wieneramus live with an illusion

it is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that cyprus is a greek island

no history book shows that it ever was

it belonged to the ottoman turks lock stock and barrel for a period of well over  years

in fact prior to the turks acquisition of it following bloody naval battles with the venetians in  ad the island of cyprus belonged invariably to several nations the assyrians the sumerians the phoenicians the egyptians the ottoman turks of course in that order owned it as their territory

but it has never been the possession of the government of greece  not even for one day  in the history of the world

moreover cyprus is located  miles from the greek mainland but only  miles from turkiyes southern coastline

saddam hussein claims that kuwait was once iraqi territory and the greek cypriot government and the terrorist greek governments think that cyprus also was once part of the greek hegemony

those arromdians involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality

again wishful thinking is unproductive only facts count

as for selanik those jews who survived these assaults in southeastern europe fled particularly to salonica whose jewish population increased substantially as a result from  in  to  in  more than half the total population though even there increased persecution by local greeks led many jews to flee elsewhere in the ottoman empire particularly to the great port of izmir

despite all the pressure from ottomans and foreign jews alike the ritual murders and other assaults by christians on jews went on and on

greek efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminated in  and  following greek conquest of salonica during the first balkan war when many of its jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving though greece was obligated by the post world war i treaties to allow jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in  which forbad all inhabitants from working on sunday stimulating a new jewish exodus as it was intended to do

between  and  there was a series of antisemitic riots in salonica with the cambel quarter where most of the remaining jews lived being burned to the ground

this was followed by regulations requiring the use of greek and prohibiting hebrew and judeaspanish in the jewish schools

a start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal jewish cemetery in salonica for use by the new university in order to derive the jews out 

by killing and driving out large numbers of jews the greeks left a substantial greek majority in the city for the first time and starting salonica jewry on the way to its final decimation by the nazis during the occupation of greece starting in 

salonica and izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for jewish refugees entering the empire during its last century of existence

istanbul edirne and other parts of rumelia and anatolia received thousands more

nor were jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the sultan

thousands of muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever balkan christian states gained independence or expanded

the russian conquest of the crimea and the caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during and after the crimean war combined with the same independence movements in southeastern europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its jews caused thousands of helpless ill and povertystricken muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the ottoman empire with the istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could

from  to  as many as  crimean tatars circassians and other muslims from north and east of the black sea had entered anatolia alone as many as  more came during the next twenty years while  refugees entered in   as a result of the ottoman wars with russia and the balkan states with an equal number gaining refuge in the european portions of the empire  robert mantran la structure sociale de la communaute juive de salonqiue a la fin du dixneuvieme siecle rh no

i will oblige

my name is elias davidsson icelandic citizen born in palestine

my mother was thrown from germany because she belonged to the undesirables at that times this group was defined as jews

she was forced to go to palestine due to many cynical factors

i have meanwhile settled in iceland  years ago and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland palestine because of the same reason they belonged to the indesirables

these people include my neighbors in jerusalem with the children of whom i played as child

their crime theyare not jews

my conscience does not accept such injustice period

my work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination

those who protest against such practices in arab countries have my support  as long as their protest is based on a principled position but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from israel

the struggle against discrimination and racism is universal

the center for policy research is a name i gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains and which command the support of many volunteers in iceland

it is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds

professionally i am music teacher and composer

i have published several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in europe

i would hope that discussion about israelpalestine be conducted in a more civilized manner

calling names is not helpful

xmailer tmail version r   in article aprthundermcrcimmcgilledu hasanmcrcimmcgilledu writes    in article flaxaprfrejteknikumuuse flaxfrejteknikumuuse jonas flygare writes       first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens     in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation     of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically     revokes the right of for its military men

clearly occupation is an     undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate

    id like you to tell me in your own words who the military are wrt israel then

  in uniform or not

on duty or offduty

soldier to be or not

  that is since its compulsory one might regard any israeli as a   legit target using that definition   in uniform or not 

doesnot make a difference if the person is in army

 on duty or offduty

doesnot matter if the army man was on duty or on a  vacation week

 soldier to be or not

sure i meant only military men

just trying to get this clear so please bear with me

as far as i can tell youre proposing the following rules of engagement between israel and the palestinean resistance

please feel revise this preliminary draft as necessary  israeli military personnel are fair game at any time in uniform or out on duty or off

in practice since any male or female israeli of military age 

may be offduty military all but young children are acceptable targets

since the existence of israel constitutes indication of hostile intent no further provocation is required

to avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of noncombatant palestineans israeli forces must not engage palestineans without positive identification as military personnel clear indication of aggressive intent and a clear field of fire

a positive identification may be assured by either checking for palestinean military uniform by posession of exclusively military armament ie t mbts or mig aircraft or selfidentification either verbal or documentary

note that dualuse militarycivilian weaponry such as hand grenades ak rifles and rpg launchers do not constitute positive military identification and require closer inspection such as document checks

b aggressive intent as distinct from merely hostile intent which is the normal condition may be assured by not less than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals of not less than ten seconds between rounds

note that a single burst of automaticweapon fire counds as one round as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source

as noted above dualuse weaponry may not be assumed to originate from military personnel and thus do not justify armed response

c a clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive military identification of all personnel in the target area of the weapons to be used

note that aggressive intent need not be proven for all possible targets

thus if iaf aircraft are attacked by a sam crew it is not necessary to check the papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously civilians as indicated for instance by the posession of uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones axes and molotov coctails

since it is often difficult for iaf elements to land and make the necessary checks ground forces should first screen prospective strike areas before agm fire

for acm purposes a cockpittocockpit pass within  meters is usually sufficient for this purpose but may be repeated if necessary

first of all i have to reiterate that your terminology in describing the events of  are extremely misleading

cyprus is not occupied by turkish forces it was invited by turkish cypriots and intervened ohi seei didnt realize this

i think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic and your reasons for thinking the way you do

you should then distribute them amongst the worlds population

you see i dont think there are many people who are aware of this fact

thank you for telling us the truth

btw i would start by sending your flyers to each of the un officials

also after you have distributed your flyers you might consider hiding

you see i think that once more people read what you think they will have to lock you up in a mental institute and dont think they will ever let you out

it is a strange strange world you live in

nonwhites   dont count

  hmmsome might say kuwaitis are nonwhite

ooops i forgot kuwaitis are  oil rich loaded with petrodollars etc so they dont count

 and lets not forget somalia which is about as far from white as it gets

and why are we in somalia

when right across the gulf of aden are some of the wealthiest arab nations on the planet

why does the us always become the point man for this stuff

i dont mind us helping out but what invariably happens is that everybody expects us to do most of the work and take most of the risks even when these events are occuring in other peoples back yards and they have the resources to deal with them quite well thank you

i mean its not like either serbia or somalia represent some overwhelming military force that their neighbors cant handle

nor are the logistics a big deal  its a lot bigger logistical challenge to get troops and supplies from new york to somalia than from saudi arabia harder to go from texas to serbia than turkey or austria to serbia

memoirs of an american officer who witnessed the armenian genocide of 

million muslim people p  seventh paragraph and p  first paragraph

the most are inside houses

come you and look

no dammit

my stomach isnt one is a turkish officer in uniform

him you must see

we were under those trees by the mosque in an open space

i dont believe you i said but followed to a nailstudded door

the man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse

i thought i should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and went inside

the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for its stone walls had only window slits

rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot

all looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed

as the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a mans body lying face up naked but for its grimy turban

he was about fifty years old by what was left of his face  a rifle butt had bashed an eye

the one left slanted as with tartars rather than with turks

any uniform once on him was gone so id no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals

p  first paragraph

how many people lived there

oh about eight hundred

he yawned

did you see any turk officers

no sir

i was in at dawn

all were tartar civilians in mufti

the lieutenant dozed off then i but in the small hours a voice woke me  dros

he stood in the starlight bawling out an officer

anyone keelhauled so long and furiously id never heard

then abruptly dro broke into laughter quick and simple as childs

both were a cover for his sense of guilt i thought or hoped

for somehow despite my boast of irreligion christian massacring infidels was more horrible than the reverse would have been

from daybreak on armenian villagers poured in from miles around

the women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of djul

they hauled out every hovels chattels the last scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags looms even spinningwheels

thank you for a lot dro i said to him back in camp

but now i must leavewe shook hands the captain said a bientot mon camarade

and for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains

like lots wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran

p 

at morning tea dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the karabakh

deep in tactics they spoke russian but i got their contempt for allied neutral zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs

a campaign shaped more raids on moslem villages

p 

it will be three hours to take dro told me

wed close in on three sides

the men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets merrimanov said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow

that is for morale dro put in

we must keep the moslems in terror

soldiers or civilians

i asked

there is no difference said dro

all are armed in uniform or not

but the women and children

will fly with the others as best they may

p 

the ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still

hundreds of feet down the fog held solid as cotton flock

djul lies under that said dro pointing

our men also attack from the other sides

then wheeee

his whistle lined up all at the rock edge

bayonets clicked upon carbines

over plunged archo his black haunches rippling then followed the staff the horde  nose to tail bellies taking the spur

armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though i heard our utica brass roar

as i watched from the height it took ages for djul to show clear

a tsing of machinegun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed dogs barked invisible while i ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle

mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly

the came a shrill wailing

now among the cloudstreaks rose darker wisps  smoke

red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs

a mosque stood in clump of trees thick and green

through crooked alleys on fire horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot

tartarski

shouted the gunner by me

others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shellnose loaded and yanked breechcord firing again and again

shots wasted i thought when by afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body

but these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the womens cries

at length all shooting petered out

i got on my horse and rode down toward djul

it burned still but little flame showed now

the way was steep and tough through dense scrub

finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly through alders on smoldering houses

across trampled wheat my brothersin arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb

p  fourth paragraph

corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair large eyes

she looked about twelve years old

she lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack shed been toting

the bayonet had gone through her back i judged for blood around was scant

between the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun dress

the next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and kneepants

he lay face down in the path by several huts

one arm reached out to the pewter bowl hed carried now upset upon its dough

steel had jabbed just below his neck into the spine

there were grownups too i saw as i led the sorrel around

djul was empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dros germanspeaking colonel

he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead

  in article aprncsuedu hernlemchessncsuedu  brad hernlem writes     in article bce

newsserviceuciedu tclockorionoacuciedu  tim clock writes     are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover   israel should totally back down

sothe easiest way to get away with   attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the   other respects innocent lives

   tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong

assuming that they are   using civilians for cover   assuming

also come on brad

if we are going to get anywhere in  this or any discussion it doesnt help to bring up elements i never  addressed nor commented on in any way

i made no comment on who is  right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover  and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas  they will be injured as both parties continue their fight

pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three idf troops and then later know the exact number and whereabouts of all of them

several villages were shelled

how could the idf possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted villages

you see it was an arbitrary act of retaliation

  if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working

why   is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages

why   not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone

you see there   is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation   getting backgetting even

it doesnt make sense to shell the   villages

the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli   government for the lives of civilians

  i agree with you here

i have always thought that israels bombing  sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane and  ineffective

but there is no reason that israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that  taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks

  as i said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively  on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after  the attackers had entered israeli territory

it didnt work very well

 the host arab state did littlenothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks  were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path

the problem tim is that the original reason for the invasion was palestinian attacks on israel not lebanese attacks

    whatso the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states   can start all over again

while i also hope for this to happen it will   only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the   responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their   soil

they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way   israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of   tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence

    if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has   no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks

  this is just another selectively applied statement

  the reason for this drawnout impasse between ababspalestinians and israelis  is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other

by your  criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations

  that is precisely why the palestinians in their recent pisga proposal for  the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are  demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already

they do  not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow  palestinians to reach full autonomy

  do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians

 if you do then why should israels view of arabspalestinians  be any different

why should they trust the arabpalestinians words

 since they dont they are very reluctant to give up tangible assets  land control of areas in exchange for words

for this reason  they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have  that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached

first i believe that my statement applies to both sides

having said that i think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately negotiable and what is not

for example no country has the right to abuse ones human rights

deciding whether there will be one or two states in palestine is a legitimate question

while de facto one state exists israel must treat all within its domain equitably

  tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been   disarmed

hezbollah remains the only independent militia

hezbollah does   not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up   sheikh mosavi his wife and young son

  while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars  have been removed the weapons needed to crossborder attacks still  remain to some extent

rocket attacks still continue and commando  raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard  for human life yours of that of others

such attacks also continue

yes i am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify occupying your neighbors land

israel must resolve its disputes with the native palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks

  of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon   and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldnt   make the lebanese so mad as to do that

  bat guano

the situation you call for existed in the s and attacks  were commonplace

not true

lebanese were not attacking israel in the s with a strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference i believe that the border could be adequately patrolled

the palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed in past years and i do not see as significant a threat as once existed

please tim dont fall into the trap of treating lebanese and palestinians as all part of the same group

there are too many who think all arabs or all muslims are the same

too many times i have seen people support the bombing of palestinian camps in retaliation for an idf death at the hands of the lebanese resistance or the shelling of lebanese villages in retaliation for a palestinian attack

 tim

amehdisrchoneywellcom hossien amehdi writes  you know when israelis f thanks to general dynamics fly high in the sky and bomb the hell out of some village in lebanon where civilians including babies and eldery getting killed is that plain murder or what

 if you arabs wouldnt position guerilla bases in refugee camps artillery batteries atop apartment buildings and munitions dumps in hospitals maybe civilians wouldnt get killed

kinda like saddam hussein putting civilians in a military bunker

 ed

  who is the you arabs here

since you are replying to my article you  are assuming that i am an arab

well im not an arab but i think you  are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said

the  bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in lebanon by israel is  very consistent with its policy of intimidation

that is the only  policy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in  the middle east

  i was merley pointing out that the other side is also suffering

 like i said im not an arab but if i was say a lebanese you bet  i would defende my homeland against any invader by any means

tell me then would you also fight the syrians in lebanon

oh no of course not

they would be your brothers and you would tell that you invited them

on the th i had got my crew done the paper work and left for the zhdanov district

thats in azerbaijan near the nagorno karabagh region

after the th rumors started to the effect that in karabagh specifically in stepanakert an uprising had taken place

they said uprising in azerbaijani but i dont think it was really an uprising just a demonstration

after that the unrest started

several armenians living in the zhdanov district were injured

how were they injured

they were beaten even women it was said that they were at the demonstrations but they live here and went from here to karabagh to demonstrate

after that i felt uneasy

there were some conversations about armenians among the local population the armenians had done this the armenians had done that

right there at the site

i was attacked a couple of times by kids

well true the guys from my crew wouldnt let them come at me with cables and knives

after that i felt really bad

i didnt know where to go

i up and called home

and my children tell me theres unrest everywhere be careful

well i had a project going on

i told the second secretary of the district party committee what had been going on and said i wanted to take my crew off the site

they wouldnt allow it they said nothings going to happen to you weve entrusted the matter to the police weve warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to you

well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened

this man didnt leave me alone for five minutes he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us too

i sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tells me the situation is very tense be careful

we finished the job at the site and i left for sumgait first thing on the morning of the th

when we left the guys warned me they told me that i shouldnt tell anyone on the way that i was an armenian

i took someone elses business travel documents in the name of zardali and hid my own

i hid it and my passport in my socks

we set out for baku

our guys were on the bus they sat behind and i sat up front

in baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case

as it turns out they knew what was happening in sumgait

i arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of sumgait is closed there is no way to get there

that the city is closed off and the buses arent running

buses normally leave baku for sumgait almost every two minutes

and suddenlyno buses

well we tried to get there via private drivers

one man an azerbaijani said lets go find some other way to get there

they found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to sumgait

he took us there

but the others had said i wouldnt go if you gave me a thousand rubles

why

because theyre burning the city and killing the armenians

there isnt an armenian left

well i got hold of myself so i could still stand up

so we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we set off for sumgait

on the way the driver says in fact there arent any armenians left

they burned them all beat them all and stabbed them

well i was silent

the whole wayodd milesi was silent

the driver asks me how old are you old man

he wants to know if im being that quiet not saying anything maybe it means im an armenian

how old are you

he asks me

i say im 

im  too but i call you old man

i say it depends on god each persons life in this world is different

i look much older than my years thats why he called me old man

well after that he was silent too

were approaching the city i look and see tanks all around and a cordon

before we get to the kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand

well he was waving his hand we all start waving our hands

im sitting there with them i start waving my hand too

i realized that this was a sign that meant there were no armenians with us

i look at the citythere is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street you know and theres no traffic

well probably i was scared

they stopped our car

people were standing on the sidewalks

they have armature shafts and stones 





and they stopped us 





along the way the driver tells us how they know whos an armenian and whos not

the armenians usually 





for example im an armenian but i speak their language very well

well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually correct

the pronunciations are different

anyone who says pundukh even if theyre not armenian they immediately take out and start to slash

another one says there was a car there with five people inside it he says

they started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire

and they didnt let the people out he says they wouldnt let them get out of the car

i only saw the car but the driver says that he saw everything

well he often drives from baku to sumgait and back 





when they stop us we all get out of the car

i look and theres a short guy his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one

were azerbaijani they tell him no armenians here

he did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says maybe youre an armenian old man

but in azerbaijani i say you should be ashamed of yourself

and 





he left

turned and left

that was all that happened

what was i to do

i had to 





the city was on fire but i had to steal my children out of my own home

they stopped us at the entrance to mir street thats where the kavkaz store and three large story buildings are

thats the beginning of downtown

i saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal remained

i couldnt figure out if it was a zhiguli or a zaporozhets

later i was told it was a zhiguli

and the people in there were completely incinerated

nothing remained of them not even any traces

that driver had told me about it and i saw the car myself

the car was there

the skeleton a metallic carcass

about  to  yards from the kavkaz store

i see a military transport an armored personnel carrier

the hatches are closed

and people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the crowd is

and i hear shots not automatic fire its true but pistol shots

several shots

there were azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier

someone in the crowd was shooting

apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something

at that point there was only one armored personnel carrier

and all the tanks were outside the city cordoning off sumgait

i walked on

i see two azerbaijanis going home from the plant

i can tell by their gait that theyre not bandits theyre just people walking home

i joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you see

but i avoided the large groups because im a local and might be quickly recognized

i tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer people

well so i walked into microdistrict  which is across from our block

i cant get into our block but i walked where there were fewer people so as to get around

well there i see a tall guy and  to  people are walking behind him

and hes shouting into a megaphone comrades the armenian azerbaijani war has begun

the police have megaphones like that

so theyre talking and walking around the second microdistrict

i see that theyre coming my way and turn off behind a building

i noticed that they walked around the outside buildings and inside the microdistricts there were about  or  people standing on every corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the edges

what they were doing i cant say because i couldnt get up close to them i was afraid

but the most important thing was to get away from there to get home and at least find out if my children were alive or not

i recently read that during bill clintons campaign he stated that if elected he would immediately recognize jerusalem as israels capital

according to the article mr clinton reaffirmed this after winning the presidency

however during recent talks with president mubarak secretary of state christopher stated that the status of jerusalem will be a final matter of discussion between the parties

now i dont want to start a big discussion over the status of jerusalem

all i want to know is if anyone can authenticate mr clintons statements with dates places etc

from a recent interview in middle east insight magazine clinton said that he supports moving the us embassy to jerusalem but would not do so at this time because it would interrupt the peace talks

at last i hope that the us insists that turkey stay out of the karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never occur again

do you have a terminal cold

karabag is turkish and will remain turkish

here we are almost at the end of the th century and a whole community the azeri turks of xsoviet armenia and karabag is facing forced assimilation torture and murder on one hand and forced exodus expulsion and genocide on the other all because of their ethnic and religious background

and one should ask herself is the world community really so powerless

where are all those human rights advocates

where are all the decent people

are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it

the number of azeris murdered by the terrorist armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing

on the one hand they wish to distort the truth and on the other they beg mercy from turkiye

the agemelbourne by helen womack  agdam azerbaijan thursday the exact number of victims is still unclear but there can be little doubt that azeri civilians were massacred by armenian fighters in the snowy mountains of nagornokarabakh last week

refugees from the enclave town of khojaly sheltering in the azeri border town of agdam give largely consistent accounts of how their enemies attacked their homes on the night of  february chased those who fled and shot them in the surrounding forests

yesterday i saw  freshly dug graves in one cemetery in addition to four mutilated corpses we were shown in the mosque when we arrived in agdam late on tuesday

i also saw women and children with bullet wounds in a makeshift hospital in a string of railway carriages

khojaly an azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by armenians had a population of about 

mr rashid mamedov commander of police in agdam said only about  escaped to his town

so where are the rest

some might have taken prisoner he said or fled

many bodies were still lying in the mountains because the azeris were short of helicopters to retrieve them

he believed more than  had perished some of cold in temperatures as low as minus  degrees

one refugee rami nasiru described how khojaly residents at first thought the attack was no more than the routine shooting to which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict

but when they saw the armenians with a convoy of armored personnel carriers they realised they could not hope to defend themselves with machineguns and grenades and fled into the forests

in the small hours the massacre started

mr nasiru who believes his wife and two children were taken prisoner repeated what many other refugees have said  that troops of the former soviet army helped the armenians to attack khojaly

it is not my opinion i saw it with my own eyes

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

tamamidis the way you put it it is only the turks  who bear the responsibility of the things happening today

that is hard to  believe for somebody trying to be objective

 when it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot  blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides

 what were you doing on anatolia after the ww anyway

 do you think it was your right to be there

there were a couple millions of greeks living in asia minor until  someone had to protect them

if not us who

is that so

or you were taking advantage of weakness of ottoman empire to grab some land

as soon as you got green lights from allied forces you occupied izmir and other cities in western turkey

you killed and raped millions people without any reason

of course you paid the price

mustafa kemal ataturk made you swim in aegean sea but not far enough

your aggressions thru turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall not get you anywhere

 i am not saying that conflicts started with that

it is only  not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering

 it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise

 i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the  visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey

i thought it  was a positive attempt to make the relations better

 compromise on what the invasion of cyprus the involment of turkey in greek politics the refusal of turkey to accept  miles of territorial waters as stated by international law the properties of the greeks of konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the greek lakesorry aegean

what compromise are you talking about on cyprus

that is not greece business to join the island to greece

that is up to people in the island to live or not to live together

they made their decision and they are living separetely nowthere is a peace there

greeks cant slaughter turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there

your dream will never come true

mile territorialwater

are you joking or dreaming

we can declare our  miles territorial water which can come close to athens

how would you like it

if you have any guts why dont you shoot at some turkish ships in your dream  mile territorial waters

we do not have any city called konstantinople

we have a city called istanbul

all the greeks in istanbul are being treated just any other turks

there is no difference among people in turkey

you look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in turkey

what are the rights of turks in greece

nothing

they do not even have basic human rights like right to have property fredom of religion fredom of press fredom of vote elect their community leaders

government of greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools religious places houses and farms belong to turkish minority

then greek government forces these minorities to go to turkey without anything with them

you will dream to see aegean sea as greek lake but it will never happen

think about the war between turkey and greece in 

the river called sakarya flood  days filled with blood in 

 the greeks i mentioned who wouldnt talk to me are educated  people

they have never met me but they know

i am bad person  because i am from turkey

politics is not my business and it is  not the business of most of the turks

when it comes to individuals  why the hatred

any person who supports the policies of the turkish goverment directly or indirecly is a bad person

it is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the actions of your goverment that make you bad

people do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you are

you are a supporter of the policies of the turkish goverment and as a such you must pay the price

you mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the government of greece is a good person

that is your greek idea to say turks are bad people

we know who we are and proud to be turks anywhere in the world

that is not greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are

you are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities

millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen their rights are taken away from them and they have no voices under the government of greece

they are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into th century

therefore do not make me laught at you

 so that makes me think that there is some kind of  brainwashing going on in greece

after all why would an educated person  treat every person from a nation the same way

can you tell me about your  history books and things you learn about greekturkish  encounters during your schooling

 take it easy

you do not need brainwashing to turn people against the turksjust as greeks arats slavs kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under turkish occupation

they will talk to you about murdersrapesdistruction

you do not learn about turks from history books you learn about them from people who experienced first hand turkish friendliness

the government of greece is actively supporting terrorism against turkeyarmenian and kurdish terrorists have headquarters in athens

they are being trained in special camps in greece

they are taught how to kill innocent women and childrenthis not a claim this is a fact known by whole world

in conlusion you are in action to murder rape destroy the innocent people

i do not take you seriously because you are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity

your own government the government of greece actively supports atrocities in bosnia

serbss barbarism pleases your government

please napoleon think twice before you write anything about turks and turkey

you are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of the minorities

who wants to be a fried with someone whose government does not respect the human rights supports terrorism in turkeybarbaric actions in bosnia treats turkish minorities as third class citizen and take away all of their rights treating them as slaves at the beginning of th century

i think the israeli press might be a tad bit biased in reporting the events

i doubt the propaganda machine of goering reported accurately on what was happening in germany

it is interesting that you are basing the truth on israeli propaganda

 since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either arab or palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn

is one form of propoganda more reliable than another

there are many neutral human rights organizations which always report on the situation in the ot

but as most people used to see on tv the israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the ot

the israelis used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters

so this is another kind of terrorism committed by the jews in palestine

they do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in palestine

to determine that is to try and get beyond the writers political agenda whether it is on or against our side

 tim anas omran

from jarefaradayclasvirginiaedu virginias gentleman subject re israeli terrorism organization university of virginia lines  would it be asking too much for you to document these allegations of israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters

i think you confuse israel with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion of a free unmonitored by the government press corps would be a joke

as for the notion that israel threatens the human rights of palestinians by sealing off the gaza strip get real

when the palestinianonpalestinian civil war stops and all palestinians can behave like mature human beings israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace

are you aware that there is an arms embargo on all of what iswas yugoslavia including bosnia which guarantees massive military superiority of serbian forces and does not allow the bosnians to try to defend themselves

should we sell weapons to all sides or just the losing one then

ending an embargo does not we must sell anything at all

if the europeans want to sell weapons to one or both sides they are welcome as far as im concerned

you seem to oppose ending the embargo

you know it is difficult for europeans to sell weapons when there is an embargo in place

i do not automatically accept the argument that bosnia is any worse than other recent civil wars say vietnam for instance

the difference is it is happening to white people inside europe with lots of tv coverage

but if this was the reason and if furthermore both sides are equal wouldnt all us racist americans be favoring the good christians serbs instead of the nonchristians we really seem to favor

holocaust memorial museum a costly and dangerous mistake   by theodore j okeefe  hard by the washington monument within clear view of the jefferson memorial an easy stroll down the mall to the majestic lincoln memorial has arisen on some of the most hallowed territory of the united states of america a costly and dangerous mistake

on ground where no monument yet marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of americans of all races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation sits today a massive and costly edifice devoted above all to a contentious and false version of the ordeal in europe during world war ii of nonamerican members of a minority sectarian group

now in the deceptive guise of tolerance the united states holocaust memorial museum begins a propaganda campaign financed through the unwitting largess of the american taxpayer in the interests of israel and its adherents in america

after reading the first paragraph a quick scan confirmed my first impression this is a bunch of revisionist and antisemitic hogwash

the ny times reported on april   that the museum was built through private contributions on federal land

it is not justifiable to right wrongs of previous years

well there is a bit such as the german reparations to the jewish survivors of the holocaust

certainly as such an event goes further into the past reparations become less realistic

they were our grandparents who were coldbloodedly exterminated by the armenians between  and  not yours

and you can always participate in the turkish genocide day along with millions of turkish and kurdish people on april   in the united states and canada

on this occasion we once again reiterate the unquestioned justice of the restitution of turkish and kurdish rights and  we demand that the xsoviet armenian government admit its responsibility for the turkish and kurdish genocide render reparations to the muslim people and return the land to its rightful owners

the recognition of the genocide has become an issue which cannot be delayed further and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed

we believe the time has come to demand from the the united states that it formally recognizes the turkish and kurdish genocide adopts the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to armenian pressures to the contrary

as taxpayers of the united states we express our vehement protest to the present us government policy of continued coddling protection and unqualified assistance towards xsoviet armenia

we also demand that the united states return to the policies advocated by us

ambassador bristol and other enlightened statesmen who have undertaken a just human and benevolent attitude towards the rights of the muslim people and the just resolution of their case

our territorial demands are strictly aimed at xsoviet armenias

the golan heights is a serious security problem and israel obviously will have to keep part of it and give up part of it

one should remember that the golan heights had been part of the area that was to be in britains palestine mandate slated to become part of the jewish state until britain traded it to france for other considerations

in other words it is an historical accident that it was ever part of syria

the palestine mandate had no borders before the borders were negotiated and drawn

the most the golan may have been is on the list of what territories britian would have liked to see in the palestine mandate

until the mandates came into existance there were no defined boundaries between any of the various territories in the region

the incidents occurred in the town of khan younis and involved soldiers of the golani brigade who have been at the centre of housetohouse raids for palestinian activists during the closure which was imposed on the strip and occupied west bank

five days ago girls at the alkhansaa secondary said a group of naked soldiers taunted them yelling come and kiss me

when the girls fled the soldiers threw empty bottles at them

on saturday a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their pants when they saw girls from alkhansaa walking home from school

parents are considering keeping their daughters home from the allgirls school

the same day soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth escaped from them at a boys secondary school

deputy principal srur abujamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls backed them against a wall and put their arms around them

when teacher hamdan abuhajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat him with the butts of their rifles

on tuesday troops stopped a car driven by abdel azzim qdieh a practising moslem and demanded he kiss his female passenger

qdieh refused the soldiers hit him and the yearold passenger kissed him to stop the beating

on friday soldiers entered the home of zamno abuealyan  blindfolded him and his wife put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance

 israeli troops bar christians from jerusalem israeli troops prevented christian arabs from entering jerusalem on thursday to celebrate the traditional mass of the last supper

two arab priests from the greek orthodox church led some  worshippers in prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied west bank from jerusalem after soldiers told them only people with armyissued permits could enter

right now our brothers are celebrating mass in the church of the holy sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer said father george makhlouf of the ramallah parish

israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of palestinian attacks against jews

the closure cut off arabs in the west bank and gaza strip from jerusalem their economic spiritual and cultural centre

father nicola akel said christians did not want to suffer the humiliation of requesting permits to reach holy sites

makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory allowing jews free movement to take part in recent passover celebrations while restricting christian celebrations

yesterday we saw the jews celebrate passover without any interruption

but we cannot reach our holiest sites he said

an israeli officer interrupted makhloufs speech demanding to see his identity card before ordering the crowd to leave

it seems that terrorism against their own conationals has been a prominent part of the revolutionary activities of the dashnag leaders of the caucasus

organized to fight the turks these chieftains have been more successful in their fight against their armenian opponents in turkey and the caucasus very often defenseless and innocent

p 

the fact remains however that the leaders of the turkish armenian section of the dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the turkish cause when the turks entered the warand a call was sent for armenian volunteers to fight the turks on the caucasian front

p  third paragraph armenian troops who having pillaged and destroyed all the moslem villages in the plain caravans of refugees were in the meanwhile constantly arriving from the plain from which the whole moslem population was fleeing with as much of their personal property as they could transport seeking to obtain security and protection p  first paragraph in those moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for arms by the armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such search and not only had many moslems been killed but horrible tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where valuables had been hidden of which the armenians were aware of the existence although they had been unable to find them

p  first paragraph shortly afterwards the head of the miserable column appeared

there were in all about  persons mostly old men and women and children with a few oxcarts ponies and donkeys carrying all their worldly possessions except a few sheep that they were driving before them

their leader interviewed bekir bey and was told to keep farther on into the hills where he would be able to cross the frontier into turkey unmolested by his enemies

p  first paragraph the armenians from the plain were attacking the kurdish line with artillery with probably a large force in support

p  first paragraph the arrival of this british brigade was followed by the announcement that kars province had been allotted by the supreme council of the allies to the armenians and that announcement having been made the british troops were then completely withdrawn and armenian occupation commenced

hence all the trouble for the armenians at once commenced the wholesale robbery and persecution of the muslem population on the pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms

the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks

another cpr nonfact

the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some 

people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel

actually they are free to leave and seek work in egypt except that the egyptians dont want them either

and who are you going to blame ifwhen gazans establish their own state of gazapalestine

while polish nonjews risked their lives to save jews from the ghetto no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help the gazan resistance

the only help given to gazans by israeli jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

actually one such jew who did risk his life to help gazan arabs was hacked to death by palestinean murderers just last week

it seems that the risk has been primarily from the arabs in need of help

this is also true for telephone repairmen traders who seek to buy agricultural products from gazans israeli soldiers who get involved in fighting between feuding palestinean groups that are as determined to destroy each other as they are to destroy outsiders the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice

a population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors

i just wanna see you try this here in the usa

you know whats going to happen

as is known the israeli regime is considering gazans unworthy of israeli citizenship and equal rights in israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in israeli hotels shops and fields

many gazans are born in towns and villages located in israel

they may not live there for these areas are reserved for the master race

tamamidis the way you put it it is only the turks  who bear the responsibility of the things happening today

that is hard to  believe for somebody trying to be objective

 when it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot  blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides

 what were you doing on anatolia after the ww anyway

 do you think it was your right to be there

there were a couple millions of greeks living in asia minor until 

someone had to protect them

if not us who

 i am not saying that conflicts started with that

it is only  not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering

 it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise

 i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the  visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey

i thought it  was a positive attempt to make the relations better

 compromise on what the invasion of cyprus the involment of turkey in greek politics the refusal of turkey to accept  miles of territorial waters as stated by international law the properties of the greeks of konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the greek lakesorry aegean

there are some things on which there can not be a compromise

 the greeks i mentioned who wouldnt talk to me are educated  people

they have never met me but they know

i am bad person  because i am from turkey

politics is not my business and it is  not the business of most of the turks

when it comes to individuals  why the hatred

any person who supports the policies of the turkish goverment directly or indirecly is a bad person

it is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the actions of your goverment that make you bad

people do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you are

you are a supporter of the policies of the turkish goverment and as a such you must pay the price

 so that makes me think that there is some kind of  brainwashing going on in greece

after all why would an educated person  treat every person from a nation the same way

can you tell me about your  history books and things you learn about greekturkish  encounters during your schooling

 take it easy

you might have to start asking the same sort of questions of arab countries as well

you realize it would not work as the arab countries treatment of jews over the last several decades is so bad that your fixation on israel would begin to look like the biased attack that it is

  everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid center for policy research is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot who hates israel

  why dont you try being honest about your hatred of israel

i have heard that your family once lived in israel but the members of your family could not cut the competition there

is this true about your family

is this true about you

is this actually not about israel but is really a personal vendetta

why are you not the least bit objective about israel

do you think that the name of your phonybaloney center hides your bias in the least

get a clue mr davidsson

havent you realized yet that when you post such stupidity in this group you are going to incur answers from people who are armed with the truth

havent you realized that a piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a truth

havent you realized that you are in over your head

the people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or need them to be

this is not the place for such pseudoanalysis

you will be continually ripped to shreds until you start to show some regard for objectivity

or you can continue to show what an antiisrael zealot you are trying to disguise your bias behind a pompous name like the center for policy research

 i said the fixation on bosnia is due to it being in a european country  rather than the third world i recall before we did anything for somalia apparent leftwingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to bosnia than to somalia was because the somalis are thirdworlders who americans consider unworthy of help

they suddenly shut up when the us decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory

i am a staunch republican btw

the irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on vietnam has not escaped me

i was opposed to us intervention in somalia for the same reasons although clearly it was not nearly as risky

based on the same reasons

you mean you were opposed to us intervention in somalia because since somalia is a european country instead of the third world the desire to help somalia is racist

i dont think this same reason applies to somalia at all

the whole point is that somalia is a third world country and we were more willing to send troops there than to bosniaexactly the opposite of what the fixation on european countries theory would predict

similarly the desire to help muslims being fought by christians is also exactly the opposite of what that theory predicts

for that matter this theory of yours suggests that americans should want to help the serbs

after all theyre christian and the muslims are not

if the desire to intervene in bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us why does everyone want to help the side that is less like us

especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think

well one thing you have to remember is the press likes a good story

good for business dont you know

and btw not everyone wants to help the side that is less like us

im referring to people who want to help at all of course

you dont see people sending out press releases help bosnian serbs with ethnic cleansing

the muslim presence in the balkans should be eliminated now

well except for some serbs but i admit that the desire of serbs in america to help the serbian side probably is because those are people more like them

the terrorist zionists cut the mujahids body into small pieces to the extend that his body was not recognized

at leat ten houses were destroyed by these atnitank missiles

from center for policy research cprigcapcorg subject re nazi eugenic theories circulated by nfid raprcirruscocdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  in my postings i have made a proposal for comments and discussion

those who dont want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so

however i would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner legally responsible for their deeds

i cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and i urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats

ps my proposal has nothing to do with nazi eugenics

it has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice

i dont consider that justice is done when nonjews who fled or were expelled in  are not permitted to return to their homeland

this can at best be called pragmatism a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong

it can never be called justice

and peace without justice will never be peace

it is my conviction that the situation in which a state through the law attempts to discourage mixed marriages as israel does is not normal

such a state resembles more nazi germany and south africa than western democracies such as the united states in which jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands

my proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriagewhen the day will come and israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency such a fund would not be needed any more

i dont mind if jews wish to marry jews and keep their traditions why not 

but this is not the affairs of a state

western democracy clearly separates these domains and i am certain that most american jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed christian state and to have their green cards stamped with a mark jew

i would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that jews who respect judaism are uncivilized

such behaviour is not good for judaism

newsserviceuciedu tclockorionoacuciedu tim clock writes     are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel   should totally back down

sothe easiest way to get away with attacking   another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects   innocent lives

  tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong

assuming that they are using  civilians for cover are they not killing soldiers in their country

if the  buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working

why is it  further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages

why not just  kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone

you see there is more to  the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back  getting even

it doesnt make sense to shell the villages

the least  it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of  civilians

if you recall a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon this

when someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment the topic arosewhen does a civilian stop becoming a civilian

if he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will aiding them has he violated his civilian status

  what

so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states   can start all over again

while i also hope for this to happen it will   only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the   responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their   soil

they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way   israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of   tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence

  if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has  no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks

but dont you see that the same statement can be made both ways

if lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy

afterall israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in lebanon during slg

 tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been  disarmed

hezbollah remains the only independent militia

hezbollah does  not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up  sheikh mosavi his wife and young son

of course if israel would withdraw  from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldnt  make the lebanese so mad as to do that

furthermore with hezbollah  subsequently disarmed it would not be possible

that is not exactly true

the hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of israel

  it has not

without the support and active involvement of syria   lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred

  once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain   control

if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel

  tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border

 not lately eh

  israel knows very well that the syrians are able to restrain all who would use  territory under their control to attack israel

while lebanon would be better  off with syria and israel out of its borders the presence of syrian troops  in lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on israeli territory not on  israeli troops in lebanon however

please note the distinction in the  past two years

true but the syrians did allow until at least  guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control provided that those guerillas were attacking israeli lines

the problem is that syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be

after all why would an educated person   treat every person from a nation the same way

can you tell me about your   history books and things you learn about greekturkish   encounters during your schooling

  take it easy

       tankut atan   tankutiastateedu     achtung baby

  you do not need brainwashing to turn people against the turks

just talk to  greeks arabs slavs kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under  turkish occupation

 they will talk to you about murdersrapesdistruction

  you do not learn about turks from history books you learn about them from  people who experienced first hand turkish friendliness

  napoleon well napoleon

it is your kind of people who are preventing peace on the world

first of all you didnt answer the question i asked at the end of my posting

and then you told me some bullshit throughout your posting which had no positive point about the issue filled with hatred and filled with emotions

why am i doing this

forget it i dont think you are worth it to discuss the issue

tankut atan tankutiastateedu achtung baby

it is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my postingi recieved a couple of letters toosome has debated the statement that events in bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern worldthose who contest this statement present the figures of the world war iihowever we must keep in mind that it was a world war and no country had the power to stop ittoday is the matter not of the power but of the willit seems to be that what we lack is the will

the idea of the us or any other nation taking action ie military intervention in bosnia has not been well thought out by those who advocate such action

after the belligerants are subdued it would require an occupation force for one or two generations

if you will stop and think about it you will realize that these people have never forgotten a single slight or injury they have imbibed hatred with their mothers milk

if we stop the fighting seize and destroy all weapons they will simply go back to killing each other with clubs

and the price for this futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to die

a price i am unwilling to even consider

second point of difference which makes it different from the holocastsp

is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event there is no valid comparison to the holocaust

all of the jewish people that i have known as friends were not brought up to hate

to be wary of others most certainly but not to hate

and except for the warsaw uprising they were unarmed and even in warsaw badly outgunned

it is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone elses muscles

suppose we do this thing what will you tell the parents wives children lovers of those we are sending to die

that they gave their lives in some noble cause

noble cause separating some mad dogs who will turn on them

well i will offer you some muscle

suppose we tell them that they have one week this will give foreign nationals time to leave to cease their bloodshed

at the end of that week bring in the tomahawk firing ships and destroy belgrade as they destroyed the bosnian cities

perhaps when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden attack of brains

send in missiles by all means but do not send in troops

today inspite of all the mightthe international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which by all means lift the embargo

is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bullyhence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally mankind has sided with the killersand thisi think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world

which killers

do you honestly believe they are all on one side

  i would like to share with netters a few points i picked up from the pbs  frontline program regarding irans nuclear activities aired on tuesday  april 

for the sake of brevity ill present them in some separate  points

already say it the other week on cbc snoozeworld   as many other western programs this program was laid on a bed of  misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the  program on the viewer

some of the misinformations were as follows yeah i thought bonanza was full of lies about the west    while the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against iraqi  aggression has been officially announced to be about  and even most  radical counterrevolutionary groups claim that iran and iraq had a total  of one million dead this program claims that iran alone has one million  dead left from the war

   the translation of iranian officials talks are not  true

for  example when iranian head of atomic energy says that  it hurts me to  see that iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda

the  translator says  it hurts to see that iran is doing unfriendly  research

   almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought  by iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to  undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to irans  big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in  near future and its current deficit in electrical power

why the hell would such an oil rich and hydroelectric potential to be exploited spend billions on a nuclear energy programme

  the whole program is trying to show the sharif university of  technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the  program know well that in a country like iran without a so tightly closed  society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university

taking in account  the scientific advancement of sharif u in engineering fields and its  potential role in improvement of irans industries and eventually the  lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries  to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones  in scientific and industrial efforts

   a key point in programs justifications is trying to disvalidate as  much as possible all efforts done by iaea  in their numerous visits from  irans different sites

they say we are not sure if the places visited  by iaea are the real ones or not  or  we can not rely on iaeas  reports and observation because they failed to see iraqs nuclear  activities before as if they didnt know that iraq was trying to build  nuclear weapons

yeah and we have every reason in the world to trust the iranian regime

after all theyve been so forward with us in the past   as an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the  program was the arrogance of the member of us senate foreign affairs  william triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking  from the absolute knowledge

maybe he is god

 i hope all iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their  country in western media and i hope iranian authorities continue to  their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs  and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations

hahahahahahaahah

newsserviceuciedu tclockorionoacuciedu tim clock writes  the latest israeli proposal first proposed in february of  contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the wb and gaza the palestinians implemented by negotiations

it states that  israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status  is agreed upon  the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and  coordination with israel

 israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the  areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education  business tourism labor and social welfare local police  local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious  affairs

 the palestinian counterproposal of march   there will be no limitations on its pisga powers and responsibilities  except those which derive from its character as an interim arrangement  it will have a strong police force responsible for security and public  order in the opt  it can request the assistance of a un peacekeeping force  disputes with israel over selfgoverning arrangements will be settled by  a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of  the un security council the secretary general of the un the pisga  jordan egypt syria and israel

 i have read that there will be some concrete proposals concerning creation of a palestinian police force during the talks next stage

does anyone knows of the details of this idea

how does it fit with the differing conceptions listed above

let me clearify mr turkish armenia is not getting itchy

she is simply letting the world know that she will no longer sit there quiet and let turks get away with their famous tricks

armenians do remember of the turkish invasion of the greek island of cypress while the world simply watched

and the turkish karabag is next

as for cyprus in  turkiye stepped into cyprus to preserve the lives of the turkish population there

this is nothing but a simple historical fact

unfortunately the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims

mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority

the problems in cyprus have their origin in decades of oppression of the turkish population by the greek cypriot officials and their violation of the cofounder status of the turks set out in the constitution

the coup detat engineered by greece in  to execute a final solution to the turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked turkiyes intervention

turkiye intervened reluctantly and only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues consulting with britain and greece as the other two signatories to the treaty to protect the integrity of cyprus

there simply was not any expansionist motivation in the turkish action at all

this is in dramatic contrast to the greek motivation which was openly expansionist stated as enosis union with greece

since the creation of independent cyprus in  the turkish population although smaller legally had status as the cofounder of the republic with the greek population

the greek cypriots with the support of enosisminded greeks in the mainland have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the island as a greek island with a minority population of turks

the turks of cyprus are not a minority in a greek republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their autonomy in a separate republic

turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo

she would rather not be involved with the island

but given the dismal record of brutal greek oppression of the turkish population in cyprus she simply cannot leave the fate of the islands turks in the hands of the greeks until the turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob turkish cypriots of their rights liberties and their very lives

source cyprus the tale of an island a h rizvi p   throughout cyprus following the greek cypriot premeditated onslaught of  december  the turkish sectors all over cyprus were completely besieged by greeks all telephonic telegraphic and postal communications between these sectors were cut off and the turkish cypriot communitys contact with each other and with the outside world was thus prevented

turkish quarter of nicosia and suburbs greek cypriot armed elements broke into hundreds of turkish homes and fired at the unarmed occupants with automatic weapons killing at random many turks including women children and elderly persons  turks were killed and  wounded

they also carried away as hostages more than  turks including women and children whom they forced to walk barefooted and in nightdresses across rough fields and river beds

throughout cyprus the greek cypriot administration deprived turkish cypriots including ministers mps and turkish members of the public services of the republic of their right to freedom of movement

in his report no

s of  december  to the security council the un secretarygeneral stated in this respect the following restrictions on the free movement of civilians have been one of the major features of the situation in cyprus since the early stages of the disturbances these restrictions have inflicted considerable hardship on the population especially the turkish cypriot community and have kept tension high

throughout cyprus supply of petrol was completely denied to the turkish sections

makarios addresses un security council on  july  after being ousted by the greek junta coup in the beginning i wish to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the security council for the great interest they have shown in the critical situation which has been created in cyprus after the coup organized by the military regime in greece and carried out by the greek army officers who were serving in the national guard and were commanding it

  on the road travelling to the south to the freedom of the north a turkish woman was seriously wounded and her fourmonth old baby was riddled with bullets from an automatic weapon fired by a greek cypriot mobile patrol which had ambushed the car in which the mother and her baby were travelling to the turkish region

the baby died in her mothers arms

this wanton murder of a fourmonthold baby which shocked foreign observers as much as the turkish community was not committed by irresponsible persons but by members of the greek cypriot security forces

according to the mothers statement the greek police patrol had chased their car and deliberately fired upon it

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

from bcclevelandfreenetedu mark ira kaufman subject about this center for policy research organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost thorinscwruedu i have read numerous posts over a period of several months by this antiisrael fanatic hiding in the shadow of the respectable sounding name of the center for policy research

obviously it is no research center of any kind unless researching published documents to find material to use against israel makes it so

labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising in itself

that is simply part of the propaganda process

i was curious if anyone knew who this antiisrael fanatic hiding behind his phoney research center name is

is he an arab

is he some typical antisemite hiding behind a veneer of antizionism

is he some jew who perhaps lived in israel and just couldnt make it there and is now taking his failure out on israel

lets shed some light on this clown once and for all

it will help put his nonsense in the proper perspective

and the readers of this group who are more interested in fact than in antiisrael hyperbola can ignore this junk

organization the american university  university computing center from paul h pimentel ppaauvmamericanedu subject re israels expansion ii aprnewscolumbiaedu lines  what gives isreal the right to keep jeruseleum

it is the home of the muslim a s well as jewish religion among others

heck nobody ever mentions what yitza k shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the way abdul nidal does today

seems isrealis are nowhere above arabs so theref ore they have a right to jerusaleum as much as isreal does

in article aprvmmcgillca bha bhamusicbmcgillca writes   is israels occupation of southern lebanon temporary

  israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave lebanon when the lebanese government can provide guarantees that israel will not be attacked from lebanese soil and when the syrians leave

not acceptable

syria and lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the french invasion where they were both part of the same mandate territory  read colony

israel has no right to determine what happens in lebanon

invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started

 is israels occupation of the west bank gaza and golan temporary

  the three are very different issues

israel has stated repeatedly that it will not give up the whole golan but may be willing to give part of it to syria as part of a peace agreement

again territorial expansion by force

 israel has already annexed areas taken over in the  war

these areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no legitamate governing body

citizenship was given to those residents in annexed areas who wanted citizenship

the un defines them as occupied

they are recognised as such by every nation on earth excluding one small caribean island

 israel should keep control of parts of the west bank imho

the parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge which contain few arab towns and many suburbs as well as overlooking the city of tel aviv

the eastern mountain ridge should be abandonded

this is where most of the arabs live and it is less militarily relevant

israel should also maintain a presence in the jordan valley

so the adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and a continued military presence

that is a completely unsustainable situation because the usa is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the israeli ecconomy any more

there is no money for such an occupation

if so for those of you who support it why were so many settlers moved into the territories

if it is not temporary lets hear it

  there are a number of reasons for people to move they were not moved but chose to move into disputed areas

note that since these moves were made by free willed human beings not settlers i will address two aspects of your question why the government would allow or encourage them to move and second why they did move

they were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories

machiavelli described the reasoning in the prince

the clear intention was to create a constituency which the likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population

the pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as public land

the assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse

when the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed

no amount of self justifying on the part of likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice

 the government had a number of reasons for encouraging people to move across the green line

they included security and politics

  the first reason was security

a large jewish presense makes it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate

a jewish settlements also act as fortresses in times of war

theyu also are a liability

we are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks  a second reason was political

creating settlements brought the arabs to the negotiation table

had the creation of new towns and cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in israel where there was an arab majority

there would have been no land left that could be called arab

dont fool yourself

it was the gulf war that brought the israelis to the negotiating table

once their us backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else

if the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the usa would have cut the money supply

 the fact that there are a hundered thousands jews in place changes the face of any peace settlement and restricts what land can be given away

not at all

they can chose to live in an arab state or return to israel

 some of the communites created were religious

they built their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of the s and s there are communities like this in hebron gaza and all over

there are also communities built near religious sites

the existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory not in bosnia not in the west bank

 the point is there are many reasons people moved over the green line and many reasons the government wanted them to

whatever status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all or nothing deal

new boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not be the results of a war

unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of  there will be no peace

araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else

the real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty

since the palestinians will remain heavily dependent on israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace

another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the israeli state within israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against nonjews within what is nominaly a secular state

the irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position

this will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land

phill hallambaker

 too bad

in fact by  nazi armenians in europe had established  a vast network of progerman collaborators that extended over two  continents

before you go calling the kettle black keep in mind that the turkish government was a strong supporter of nazi germany and played a vital role in supplying it with oil until the allies invaded iran

complaining about armenian complicity with the nazis does little good when turkey played a much bigger role

tell me kmagnacca were you high on arromdian of asalasdpaarf when you wrote that

humane behavior and tolerance of turks was a legend even  years ago when they accepted tens of thousands of jews from spain who were fleeing from the spanish inquisition

again many jewish families escaping from nazi armenians and hitlers nazi germany took refugee in turkiye during the s turkish people have unselfishly given home protection and freedom to the jews over the centuries including to thousands and thousands of them during the second world war

happy the minority jews which has had no christian nation to protect it

and one recalls that the jews took up their abode in fanatic turkey when they were expelled from europe especially spain by saintly christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers

to one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable

one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate

he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population

turkey and the holocaust an interview with stanford j shaw history who recently completed two books the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic and turkey and the holocaust turkeys role in rescuing turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution 

shaw chairs the undergraduate interdepartmental degree program in near eastern studies and has organized the program for the study of ottoman and turkish jewry

he is affiliated with the g e von grunebaum center for near eastern studies

editor how did you come to write these two books on turkey and european and turkish jews

shaw basically im an ottoman historian but im also jewish

ive spent twentyfive years studying ottoman history and as time went along whenever i found materials on the ottoman jews i collected them

but i never did anything with them until a couple of years ago when i suddenly realized that  was the th anniversary of the jews being expelled from spain and coming to turkey

then the sephardic temple down on wilshire avenue invited me to give a series of three lectures on ottoman jewry

these lectures were greatly appreciated and i became motivated to undertake further research to develop a book the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic

this book is quite different from the works of most jewish historians who tend to look at the jews in any country more from the viewpoint of the jews and the jewish community and rely mainly on jewish sources

i view my subject as an ottoman historian and i approach the jews of the ottoman empire largely from the point of view of ottoman society using largely ottoman sources

after i finished this book and sent it to the press i came across additional documents relating to turkish jews during world war ii

in the completed book i had said that turkey had done a good deal to rescue the jews during world war ii but i did not actually have many details

then i found a batch of documents in the foreign ministry archive relating to actions taken by turkish diplomats to help the jews before and during the holocaust

it was too late to add this new information to the book in press so i decided to write a second book

i conducted further research mainly in the archives of the foreign ministry in ankara and the turkish embassy and consulate in paris

the result was the second book turkey and the holocaust which details how turkey helped rescue jews from the nazis

how exactly did they do this

the story takes place over a number of years

the book presents the material in three parts first of which deals with the period before the holocaust

when the nazis came to power in germany in  they immediately started dismissing jews and antinazi germans from universities hospitals scientific institutes and the like

turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its universities and it saw in these jews who were being fired from their positions in germany a good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish universities

within three months after the nazis started dismissing these jews turkey arranged to take many of them in

they were brought to turkey and were given appointments as professors in the turkish universities as heads of scientific institutes and as medical personnel in hospitals

about  to  major jewish professors came to turkey in the s ernst reuter a german political scientist spent the war years teaching political science in turkey

after world war ii he was mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift

fritz neimark a major german jewish economist came to turkey and helped establish a modern school of economics in istanbul

a man named reichenbach who was rescued from the nazis by turkey and spent the war years in turkey eventually came to ucla where he became a professor of philosophy

other german jewish emigres engaged in cultural activities in turkey

one such was karl ebert who had been a leading theatrical producer in berlin until he was expelled by the nazis

he went to turkey where he organized the turkish national theater and the turkish national opera company in ankara with the help of paul hindemuth

so the first section of the book covers this first phase when jews were being persecuted in germany and rescued by turkey

oddly enough the german emigres when they were in turkey did not seem to think too badly of germany

they regarded themselves more as germans than jews and they did not join in the antinazi activities of the local turkish jewish community

i even found letters from the nazi representatives to turkey praising these german jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea of german culture

even though these people had been persecuted by the nazis and rescued by the turks they shared the nazis feelings of aryan racial superiority over the turks

the second part of the book deals with the holocaust which began in  when the nazis occupied france

in europe at that time and especially in france there were about  turkish jews

they had migrated to europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward

most of them had settled in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war i when greece was threatening to overrun turkey

the greeks had persecuted the jews throughout the nineteenth century and the jews feared what might happen to them if the greeks took over in turkey

many jews fled to france during the s and s many also abandoned their turkish citizenship and became french citizens

suddenly the nazis invaded france in  and started introducing all sorts of antijewish laws

the turkish jews soon found that it was not worth very much to be a french jew but that it was worth a lot to be a turkish jew

how so

turkey remained neutral through most of world war ii

it retained its embassies and consulates in all the nazioccupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the allies at the end of 

during the war therefore turkey was in a position to defend its citizens against antijewish measures and the actions that turkish diplomats took form the second chapter of the book

turkish diplomats who were stationed in france in particular intervened to protect jews of turkish citizenship from the nazis

for those turkish jews who had retained their turkish citizenship there was generally no problem

if they were arrested and sent to a concentration camp the turkish diplomats would communicate with the commanders of the camp and other officials and say in effect these people are turkish citizens

you cant do this to them

and the turkish jews would be released

if their businesses were confiscated the turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored

the nazis in general wanted to keep the friendship of turkey

they hoped to be able to use turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the middle east and they also wanted to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey

in order to keep turkish friendship they usually accepted these interventions on behalf of turkish jews

the turkish diplomats sometimes went to the concentration camps to secure the release of turkish jews

at times they even boarded trains hauling turkish jews to auschwitz for extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train

most of the foreign jews were sent to a concentration camp at a place called drancy in paris and thats where most of the intercession by turkish consuls took place

the greater problem came with the turkish jews who had abandoned their turkish citizenship and had become french citizens

the consuls couldnt declare that these people were turkish citizens because they were not

my book includes photographs of jews lining up in front of the turkish consulate either to get passports to return to turkey or to get a restoration of their turkish citizenship

this was a bureaucratic matter so processing the application would take some time

in the meantime it was a real emergency because the nazis would arrest jews on the streets for almost nothing

the nazis would even arrest them if they had radios or telephones in their apartments because radios and telephones were forbidden to jews

to take care of these former turkish jews the turkish diplomats invented a document called gayri muntazem vatandash or irregular fellow citizen

the document said in effect this person is a former turkish citizen who has applied for the restoration of his turkish citizenship

in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him as if he were a turkish citizen

the diplomats wrote the document in turkish and put their seals on it

since the nazis could not read turkish on the whole they accepted these papers as certificates of citizenship

by this means the turkish diplomats were able to rescue many jews who had relinquished their turkish citizenship

actually the nazis were of two minds about the turkish defense of jews

on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry which wanted to retain the friendship of turkey was in favor of accepting these interventions

on the other hand himmler and eichmann wanted all jews exterminated

at times himmler and eichmann were able to prevail and some of the turkish jews were sent off to auschwitz before the turkish consuls could do anything

do you have statistics on how many turkish jews were rescued

there were about  turkish jews in europe before world war ii about  of whom were living in france

most of the information in this section of the book relates to the situation in france

i have published the letters that the turkish consuls sent to the nazi officials and the letters that came back in reply

generally the nazis said that if the turkish consul would present documents certifying that arrested individuals are turkish citizens and promise to send them out of france the nazis would release them from the concentration camp

the turkish consuls also organized special trains to take turkish jews from nazioccupied territory back to turkey

these trains ran regularly in  and 

the nazis gave the turkish jews visas so they could pass out of nazi territory but the trains were often held up by the naziinfluenced governments of eastern europe  croatia serbia and bulgaria  because these governments really didnt want the jews to escape

as a result of the turkish consuls efforts about  to  of the turkish jews in france were saved

another  were sent off to auschwitz where most of them died

the remaining  either escaped across the border into spain or fled to the area of southern france occupied by the italians who treated jews much better than the nazis did

at the end of  however italy fell out of the war and that was the end for those jews as well

incidentally the turkish diplomats in nazioccupied greece also worked to rescue jews in that country

the second part of your book then deals with turkish diplomats acting to rescue jews of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecution

yes and there is an aside i might add here in their interventions on behalf of turkish jews the turks cited their treaty with germany which stated that turkish citizens in german territory would be treated the same as german citizens in turkey

on that basis the turks maintained that the nazis could not discriminate against turkish citizens who are jews

the nazis claimed and the vichy government agreed that they were not discriminating because they were treating all jews equally

turkey protested saying you are dividing our citizens according to religion but the turkish constitution requires that all citizens be treated equally regardless of religion

therefore you cannot single out turkish jews

american consuls in paris by contrast accepted the nazi argument and told american jews who were being persecuted by the nazis that they couldnt do anything about it because the american jews were being treated the same as other jews

the third part of the book takes place in turkey which was the principal center during the holocaust for activities aimed at the rescue of eastern european jews

the kwish agency an organization established by jews in palestine to help resettle jews to palestine set up an office in istanbul in  under the leadership of chaim barlas

other jewish organizations in palestine especially the kibbutzes also sent representatives to istanbul to set up headquarters

these groups first tried to contact jews in eastern europe to find out what was happening

today we know about the holocaust but at that time people didnt know what was going on

they didnt imagine the nazis could do the things they were doing

and so the first step was to get information and the turkish government let them use the turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends in eastern europe

the jewish organizations found out what was happening when they received replies

later on when the nazis began to intercept such letters the jews received assistance also from the vatican nuncio angelo roncali who served as the vatican representative in istanbul from  to  and later became pope john xxiii

as the vatican representative during the war he used the facilities of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government was doing to assist jewish agencies in contacting jews in eastern europe

with the cooperation of the turkish government these agencies then sent hard currency food clothing and even railroad and steamship tickets to jews in czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungary

they werent able to help much in poland because by then the nazis had wiped out almost all the polish jews

whenever possible the rescue agencies arranged for the jews to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so called orient express route to istanbul or by boat through the black sea to istanbul

turkey was not eager for all these refugees to remain within its borders during the war because it was being blockaded and was suffering terrible shortages of food and clothing

the government therefore facilitated the movement of the nonturkish jewish refugees from turkey to palestine either by the taurus express railroad through the mountains to syria and palestine or by small boats across the eastern mediterranean from southern turkey to palestine

these efforts were bitterly opposed not only by the nazis but also by the british who did not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they feared it would hurt their relations with the arabs

the british constantly pressured the turkish government to stop this traffic and send those jews back

in a few cases the turkish government yielding to british pressure did send the boats back

for example in one incident the steamship struma with some  jewish refugees from romania was sent back by the turkish government as a result of the intervention of the british ambassador

when that ship was sunk by a soviet submarine all were lost except one person

nevertheless all told the turkish government allowed no fewer than  eastern european jews to pass through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war

the turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities and money and gave them permission to send money and food out of the country

many of these jews who passed through turkey may still be living in israel

yes and their children

but lets return for a moment to the first group the turkish jews who came from europe

they did not go on to palestine they stayed in turkey

it was the nonturkish eastern european jews who passed through turkey en route to palestine

their story is very interesting

and you have rescued it from obscurity

many studies have been made of the holocaust but most of them do not focus on the eastern european or middle eastern jews

most of the scholarship has centered on the western european jews of whom  million were massacred by the nazis

my study deals with a much smaller number of people

i have tried to round out the picture and i hope my book will persuade other scholars to undertake further investigations in the history of eastern jews

when it comes to numbers the german jews were also relatively small in number

most of the millions slain were polish jews

the rescue of  eastern european jews may not seem so significant compared with the total of  million who were murdered but it meant a lot to those who were saved

about threefourths of the book consists of documents  translations of many documents

they are included because the story is not well known

not only are people in the west unaware of the courageous actions of the turkish diplomats even the people of turkey did not know the story

i felt that they would not fully understand this remarkable achievement unless they could see the documents

what languages are used in the documents

most of them are in turkish or french some are in hebrew

there is a great deal of material in hebrew about the organization of the boats going to palestine the passengers and so on but i did not go into those details extensively

i describe mostly what turkey did so most of my documents are in turkish or french

a few documents are in english

the jewish groups in istanbul did not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue jews in fact they often fought with one another

they took turns trying to get the turkish government to deport rival groups

for example some of the kibbutz groups felt that the jewish agency was run by western european jews who were interested only in helping western european jews

finally in  president roosevelt sent a personal representative ira hirschman who had been an executive of bloomingdales department store in new york city and hirschman managed to reconcile their differences

the documents related to his mission are in english

i also obtained many documents from serge klarsfeld a holocaust historian in france who mainly worked on the french jews

his father was killed by the nazis

he gave me materials he had gathered in the german archives on the turkish jews so i didnt personally consult the german archives

i believe that much more can be learned from the german archives and i hope someone someday will make the effort

this new book fits in well with your teaching doesnt it

right

 in article igcapcorg center for policy research cprigcapcorg writes   final solution for the gaza ghetto 

    while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto they  repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and  attempt to starve the gazans

     the jews in the warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and  their families from being sent to nazi gas chambers

groups like hamas  and the islamic jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all  jews into the sea

perhaps we should persuade jewish people to help   these wnderful freedom fighters attain this ultimate goal

  maybe the freedom fighters will choose to spare the cooperative jews

 is that what you are counting on elias  the pity of murderers

  you say your mother was jewish

how ashamed she must be of her son

i  am sorry mrs davidsson

  harry

ok its my turn driving the jews into the sea 

i am sick and tired of this driving the jews into the sea sentance attributed to islamic movements and the plo it simply cant be proven as part of their plan 

pro israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by bnai brith what hamas and islamic jihad believe in as far as i can get from the arab media is an islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under koranic law

this would be a reversal of the  situation in which the jews in palestine took control of the land and its mostly muslim inhabitants

however whoever committed crimes against humanity torture blowing up their homes murders must be treated and tried as a war criminal

the political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice

as for the plo i am at a loss to explain what is going inside arafats mind

although their political thinking seems far fetched with israel acting as a true superpower in the region the islamic movements are using the same weapon the jews used to establish their state  religion

i doubt the propaganda machine of goering reported accurately on what was happening in germany

it is interesting that you are basing the truth on israeli propaganda

 since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either arab or palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn

is one form of propoganda more reliable than another

  there are many neutral human rights organizations which always report  on the situation in the ot

but as most people used to see on tv the  israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the ot

i must say i was appalled by the american jewish councils open letter

america is not the worlds policeman

we cannot and should not take it upon ourselves to solve the problems of the entire world

americas young men and women should not be sent to yugoslavia period

if people feel strongly enough let them go as individuals to fight alongside the butchers of their choice

we have a volunteer army

the argument you gave only applies if we have a draft

huh

sorry i misread your remark about young men and women

though i am now unsure what that sentence does mean

furthermore people do not become butchers by being ethnic cleansed

or do you automatically call them butchers because they are muslim

i am disappointed in your logic especially coming from a stalwart of sciskeptic

you implied that anyone who wants to send troops to bosnia wants to do so to help the butchers of their choice

since the primary targets of help are muslim victims of ethnic cleansing you imply that such muslim victims are butchers

 people become butchers by butchering

there have been atrocities on all sides

this implies both sides are equal

true it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim but that does not mean that victims do not exist

would you in wwii have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the jews and the germans

these people have been butchering each other for centuries

when one side wins and gets what it wants it will stop

yes but both sides want different things

the muslims chiefly want to not be ethnic cleansed

the serbians want to ethnic cleanse the muslims

it is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent

 quite an impressive leap of reasoning to assume that i am so racist as to call someone a butcher because they are muslim

in fact i think on the contrary the media fixation on this war as opposed to the dozens upon dozens of civil wars which have been fought in the recent past is because these are white people in europe

when atrocities occur in the third world there is not as much news coverage and not nearly the same level of outrage

i recall before we did anything for somalia apparent leftwingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to bosnia than to somalia was because the somalis are thirdworlders who americans consider unworthy of help

they suddenly shut up when the us decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory

for that matter this theory of yours suggests that americans should want to help the serbs

after all theyre christian and the muslims are not

if the desire to intervene in bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us why does everyone want to help the side that is less like us

especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think

the karabakhiarmenians who have lived in their homeland for  years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are the ones directly involved in the conflict

they are defending themselves against azeri aggression

agression that has no mercy for inocent people that are costantly shelled with migs and othe russian aircraft

 at last i hope that the us insists that turkey stay out of the karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never occur again

 armenia is involved in fighting with azarbaijan

it is armenian soldiers from mainland armenia that are shelling towns in azarbaijan

you might wish to read more about whether or not it is azeri aggression only in that region

it seems to me that the armenians are better organized have more success militarily and shell azeri towns repeatedly

i dont wish to get into the cyprus discussion

turkey had the right to intervene and it did

perhaps the intervention was not supposed to last for so long but the constant refusal of the greek governments both on the island and in greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed for the ongoing standoff in the region

in april  hitler was preparing for the invasion of the caucasus

a number of nazi armenian leaders began submitting plans to german officials in spring and summer 

one of them was souren begzadian paikhar son of a former ambassador of the armenian republic in baku

paikhar wrote a letter to hitler asking for german support to his armenian national socialist movement hossank and suggesting the creation of an armenian ss formation in order to educate the youth of liberated armenia according to the spirit of the nazi ideas

he wanted to unite the armenians of the already occupied territories of the ussr in his movement and with them conquer historic turkish homeland

an interesting meeting took place between dro and reichsfuehrerss heinrich himmler toward the end of 

dro discussed matters of collaboration with himmler and after a long conversation asked if he could visit pow camp close to berlin

himmler provided dro with his private car

 a minor problem was that some of the soviet nationals were not aryans but subhumans according to the official nazi philosophy

as such they were subject to german racism

however armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged

israelis top leaders in the past and present always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the arabs

the way i see it israelis and arabs have not been able to achieve peace after almost  years of fighting because of the following two major reasons

  arab governments are not really representative of their people currently  most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor  dictators

  israeli government is arrogant and none comprising

the israeli secret service mossad is reported to have acquired significant information in connection with the camps set up in the troodos mountains in cyprus for the training of militants of the pkk and asala armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia

according to sources close to mossad about  kurdish greek cypriot and armenian militants are undergoing training in the troodos mountains in southern cyprus

the same sources stated that abu nidals special advisers are giving military training to the pkk and asala militants in the camps

they added that the militants leave southern cyprus for libya lebanon syria greece and iran after completing their training

mossad has established that due to the clashes which were taking place among the terrorist groups based in syria the pkk and asala organisations moved to the greek cypriot part of cyprus where they would be more comfortable

they also transferred a number of their camps in northern syria to the troodos mountains

mossad revealed that the armenian national movement which is known as the mna has opened liaison offices in nicosia athens and tripoli in order to meet the needs of the camps

the offices are used to provide material support for the armenian camps

meanwhile the leader of the popular front for the liberation of palestine george habash is reported to have ordered his men not to participate in the operations carried out by the pkk  asala which he described as extreme racist extreme nationalist and fascist

reliable sources have said that habash believed that the recent operations carried out by the pkk militants show that organisation to be a band of irregulars engaged in extreme nationalist operations

they added that he instructed his militants to sever their links with the pkk and avoid clashing with it

it has been established that george habash expelled asala militants from his camp after asalas connections with drug trafficking were exposed

 gd has nothing to do with it

some of the land was in fact given to the  jews by the united nations quite a bit of it was purchased from arab  absentee landlords

present claims are based on prior ownership purchase  from aforementioned absentee landlords award by the united nations in the  partition of the palestine mandate territory and as the result of  defensive wars fought against the egyptians syrians jordanians et al

     why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of   the inhabitants are not jews and do not want to be part of israel

 first i should point out that many jews do not in fact agree with the  idea that the west bank is theirs

since however i agree with those who  claim the west bank i think i can answer your question thusly the west  bank was what is called the spoils of war

hussein ordered the arab legion   this is very funny

anyway suppose that in fact israel didnot attack jordan till jordan attacked israel

  in article apryumaacnscolostateedu bhlancecolostateedu writes    it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer  in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc  some young men usually aged between  to  years are members of  the lebanese resistance

even the inhabitants of the village do not  know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often  suspect who they are and what they are up to

these young men are  supported financially by iran most of the time

they sneak arms and  ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps  for israeli patrols

every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured  by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages  of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

  this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups  to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the  opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or  in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search

certainly the  people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the  innocent civilians into harms way

  are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel  should totally back down

sothe easiest way to get away with attacking  another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects  innocent lives

tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong

assuming that they are using civilians for cover are they not killing soldiers in their country

if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working

why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages

why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone

you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even

it doesnt make sense to shell the villages

the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians

 if israel insists that  the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of  northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation  with the blood of its soldiers

 if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land

so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states  can start all over again

while i also hope for this to happen it will  only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their  soil

they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way  israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence

if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks

   i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only  real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace  settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and  peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure  no one on either side of the border is shelled

  good lord brad

 no i am not basil

i think basil is a very intelligent person and i respect what he writes

basil is a person that i would gladly call a friend

he is however not me

nor am i lebanese as some seem to suspect

 this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to  realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting  its northern cities has failed

in fact it has caused much more  israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel  would have resulted in

  perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is  the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting  against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate

ifhowever you call on israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian  arab and islamic groups

tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed

hezbollah remains the only independent militia

hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son

of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldnt make the lebanese so mad as to do that

furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible

 and now the lebanese government has proven that it is  capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did  in all other parts of lebanon

   basil   it has not

without the support and active involvement of syria  lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred

 once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain  control

if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel

tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border

not lately eh

israel knows very well that the syrians are able to restrain all who would use territory under their control to attack israel

while lebanon would be better off with syria and israel out of its borders the presence of syrian troops in lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on israeli territory not on israeli troops in lebanon however

please note the distinction in the past two years

   tim   your view of this entire matter is far too serenely onesided and  selectively naive

i disagree basil has always seemed to me to be a coolheaded person slow to anger certainly more so than i

what is most important is that he is an actual witness to things from the other end of the israeli guns

if only the israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were reversed perhaps they would moderate their retaliation

since you have nothing to say you say nothing

its brilliant

did you think of this all by yourself

my opinions should be yours

my employer has no opinions

 thats true

i try to learn from people who know more than me not from useless farts

and anyone who doesnt agree with you is by your own definitions a useless fart

just like any text that disputes your own findings is always described as flawed or biased

in other words you trumpet the things you like and dismiss those that might embarass you

weve seen you play these games here for a long time

standard of a failed president

i have found jewish people very imagentative and creative

jewish religion was the foundation for christianity and islam

in other words judaism has fathered both religions

now islam has turned against its father i may say

it is ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise

i thought the idea of believing on one god was to unite all man kind

how come both jews and islam which believe on the same god the god of ebrahim are killing each other

is this like dr frankenstiens story

how are you going to stop this from happening

how are you going to deal with so many muslims

nuking them would distroy the whole world

would god get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same god same heaven and the same hell after all

what is the peacefull way of ending this saga

 judaism did not father islam

we had many of the same prophets but judaism ignores prophets later prophets including jesus christ who christians and muslims believe in and mohammed

the idea of believing in one god should unite all peoples

however note that christianity and islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of nonchristians and nonmuslims are stated in each religion

man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state

a religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society

the praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it

god does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes that god will help him when he prays

religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life

but the religious leaders need to make a living through religion

so they may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to make their living

ie muslims have to pay  percent of their income to the mullahs

i guess the rabie gets his cut too

 we are supposed to pay  of our income after all necessities are paid

please note that this  is on a personal basis  if you are poor there is no need to pay quite the contrary this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor muslims around the world

also this money is not required in the human sense ie

a muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid and we surely dont pass money baskets around during our prayer services

is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other helps one another respect the mother nature

is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today

is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will see the outcome of his choice

how can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion

how can we stop another religious killing field under poor gods name

what are your thoughts

do you think man kind would to come its senses before it is too late

  ps

on the side  do you think that moses saw the god on mount sina

why would god go to top of the mountain

he created the earth he could have been anywhere

why on top the mountain

was it because people thought to see god you have to reach to the skiesheavens

why god kept coming back to middle east

was it because they created god through their imagination

is that why jewish people were told by god they were the chosen ones

 gods presence is certainly on earth but since god is everywhere god may show signs of existence in other places as well

we can not say for sure where god has shown signs of his existence and where he has not

profit mohammad was married to khadijeh

she was a jewish

she taught him how to trade

she probably taught him about judaism

quran is mostly copy right of taurah sp

old testement

do you think god wrote quran

makeh was a trade city before islam

do you think it was made to be the center of islamic world because mohammad wanted to expand his trade business

is that why god has put his house in there

 the quran is not a copyright of the taurah

muslims believe that the taurah the bible and the quran originally contained much the same message thus the many similiarities

however the taurah and the bible have been translated into other languages which has changed their meaning over time a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translators

the quran still exists in the same language that it was revealed in  arabic

therefore we know that mankind has not changed its meaning

it is truly what was revealed to mohammed at that time

there are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mothers womb

i think this religious stuff has gone too far

all man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up

look at david koresh how that turned out

i am afraid in the bigger scale the jews and the muslims will have the same ending

 only god knows for sure how it will turn out

i hope it wont but if that happens it was the will of god

religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than plotting each others distruction

there is one earth one life and one god

lets all man kind be good toward each other

 god help us all

peace 



please send this mail to me again so i can read the rest of what you said

and yes may god help us all

what gives isreal the right to keep jeruseleum

it is the home of the muslim a s well as jewish religion among others

heck nobody ever mentions what yitza k shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the  way abdul nidal does today

seems isrealis are nowhere above arabs so theref ore they have a right to jerusaleum as much as isreal does

what gives the united states the right to keep washington dc

from bcclevelandfreenetedu mark ira kaufman subject the israeli press organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost thorinscwruedu andy beyer has claimed that the israeli press is a bit biased

but the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the mideast that people who do not read the israeli press simply know nothing about

many of these events are not even mentioned here

i read the israeli press to learn of important events about which you know nothing because of your total reliance on western media for your information on israel

since i read both american media and israeli media i can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the american press for knowledge about israel does not have a true picture of what is going on

as to the claim that israeli papers are biased of course they are

some may lean to the right or the left just like the media here in america

but they still report events about which people here know nothing

i choose to form my opinions about israel and the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average american who relies exclusively on an american media which does not report on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy

i too strongly object to those that justify israeli rule of those who do not want that

the occupied territories are not israels to control to keep or to dominate

they certainly are until the arabs make peace

only the most leftistarabist lunatics call upon israel to withdraw now

most moderates realize that an israeli withdrawl will be based on the camp davidmadrid formulas which make full peace a prerequisite to territorial concessions

 if the armenians killed so many turks in eastern anatolia how come the area today is full of turks and muslim kurds and not full of armenians

suffering from a severe case of myopia

no muslim left alive  not a single one

leading the first armenian units who crossed the ottoman border in the company of the russian invaders was the former ottoman parliamentary representative for erzurum karekin pastirmaciyan who assumed the revolutionary name armen garo

another former ottoman parliamentarian hamparsum boyaciyan led the armenian guerrilla forces who ravaged turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname murad especially ordering that kill turks and kurds wherever you find them and in whatever circumstances you find them

turkish children also should be killed as they form a danger to the armenian nation

another former member of parliament papazyan led the armenian guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of van bitlis and mush

in march  the russian forces began to move toward van

immediately in april   the armenians of van began a revolt massacring all the turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy conquest by russians

little wonder that czar nicholas ii sent a telegram of thanks to the armenian revolutionary committee of van in april   thanking it for its services to russia

the armenian newspaper gochnak published in the united states also proudly reported in may   that only  turks remained in van the rest having been slaughtered

the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the area of transcaucasia to over  square miles

the estimated population of the entire region in  was  of whom   percent were armenian   percent georgian and   percent moslem

of the latter group  were tatars

paradoxically barely onethird of transcaucasias armenians lived in the erevan guberniia where the christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds

erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only  armenians as compared to  moslems

by the time of the russian census of  however the armenians had established a scant majority  percent in the guberniia it had risen by  to  percent or  of the  inhabitants

this impressive change in the provinces ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic a solid block of  tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia

we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination

our troops surrounded village after village

little resistance was offered

our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work

some of the tartars escaped of course

they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey

the rest were killed

and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages

they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead

in april  dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city of van whose  armenians comprised 

percent of the population closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empireleaving erivan on april   armenian volunteers reached van on may  and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during the next two days while the small ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake

knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims

armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire and to assist instead other invading russian armies

their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories

armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves

with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in  at the beginning of world war i the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottomans enemy increased drastically

ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies

 also since the ottomans were such great tolerators how come the armenians were counted as part of the rum millet ie

forced under the control of the greek orthodox patriarchate

are you people for real

the main legal principles of the turkish state are summarized in article  of the constitution the republic of turkey is a democratic secular and social state governed by the rule of law bearing in mind the concepts of public peace national solidarity and justice respecting human rights loyal to the nationalism of ataturk and based on the fundamental tenets set forth in the preamble of the constitution

freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the ottoman empire allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous

the fact that the ottoman empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms despite the lack of any written constitution

the first attempts to create a written constitution occurred in  and 

although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily they provided the basic elements of a constitution

the  constitution was the first legal document to force a parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the emperor

the constitution of  placed some additional limitations on the emperor while increasing the power of the parliament and the government

the first world war  brought the ottoman empire to an end

by the occupation of istanbul the parliament was dissolved and the constitution was abolished

the members of parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces

during the independence war the turkish grand national assembly held their first meeting on april   to serve as the legislative body of the new turkish state

this assembly prepared the new legal structure of the turkish republic

the new republic was proclaimed on october   and the new constitution was adopted in 

that constitution served as the legal backbone of todays modern turkish republic

in  turkey adopted a multiparty political system

the constitution of  was replaced by others in  and 

all three constitutions of the republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy human rights national sovereignty division of powers private ownership and secularization

major principles of the constitution the constitution with  articles establishes the structure of the republic within the following principles  the turkish republic is a democratic secular and social state governed by law  it should be governed to maintain public peace national solidarity justice human rights and the objectives of ataturk  the language of the state is turkish  sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions

sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation  legislative power is carried by the parliament elected by the nation

this power cannot be delegated transferred to any one else  executive power is exercised by the president and council of ministers  judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the turkish nation  all individuals are equal irrespective of language race religion color sex or political beliefs  laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the constitution

structure of the state in accordance with the constitution the structure of the state is based on the principle of division of power to create a balanced and selfcontrolled system

the power is divided into legislative power executive power and judicial power balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other selfcontrol

a

legislative power the turkish grand national assembly is a parliament with one house elected by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on behalf of the nation

the basic functions of this assembly are  to adopt to amend or to repeal laws  to approve or to dismiss the council of ministers  to supervise and to question ministers or the council of ministers  to debate to amend and to approve annual budgets  to ratify international agreements  to grant amnesty or pardons

members of parliament do not have any liability for their words either oral or written during the course of their legislative duties

the country is divided into constituencies

the number of representatives of each is calculated according to its population

every turkish citizen over the age of twentyone can vote

elections are supervised by the supreme council of elections which solves all disputes or appeals

in each province the local board of election runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the supreme council

members of the council and boards are elected among independent judges

b

executive power the president of the republic is the head of state not the head of government as in the unites states

the main functions of the president are  to represent the state and the country  to insure the implementation of the constitution  to coordinate legislative judicial and executive functions  act as the supreme commander of the armed forces  to ratify laws and government decrees

the president is elected by the grand national assembly for a period of seven years

the president may ratify or return the laws for a second debate may call for a referendum

executive power is exercised by the council of ministers headed by the prime minister

the prime minister is appointed by the president from the members of parliament

the prime minister names the ministers for approval by the president

the new government council of ministers reads their program at the parliament and the vote of confidence follows

there are  

ministers in the council

ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent administrative courts for their misuse of power administrative errors or functions against any law

c judicial power judicial power is exercised by independent courts

no authority or power can instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts

these cannot be discharged replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws

there are three categories of courts in the turkish judiciary system  courts of justice deal with legal commercial and criminal cases

the decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice upon the appeal of the parties involved

the decisions or functions of the executive power including the prime minister and ministers or any governmental department can be appealed in administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law

the decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the high administrative court

the laws and decisions of the grand national assembly can be examined by the constitutional court if they contradict the constitution

if found contradictory this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the parliament

from center for policy research cprigcapcorg subject hebrew labor racist connotations nfid ncdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  from center for policy research cpr subject hebrew labor racist connotations avoda ivrit  hebrew labor  hebrew labor is a concept which has served the zionist movement for a long time

it has a doublebarreled message  the new jew must learn to do physical labor ie

working the land  the land in this country must pass into jewish hands ie

to the same new jew who has learned to work it

both aspects of the twopronged concept of hebrew labor have racist connotations

on the one hand the diaspora jews lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by zionists and antisemites

on the other hand its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the arab farmer from the source of his livelihood

the occupation and the cheap palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories orchards and hothouses of israel relegated the myth of hebrew labor to the history books and nostalgic memories of the zionist movement

it has blossomed forth anew however as the governments answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories

today too this concept has two functions  to give a progressive look to the closing of the palestinian population

or in the words of environment minister yossi sarid i have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor

to furnish an answer to the unemployed israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives

the israeli government is considering plans to import labor from the far east to replace native people palestinians who work in their own country thus creating conflicting interests between two ethnical communities and ruling over them

if you want a copy send me mail

   was the article about zionism

or about something else

the majority  of people i heard emitting this ignorant statement do not really  know what zionism is

they have just associated it with what they think  they know about the political situation in the middle east

why no 

because they do not want to  overdo it and stir people against israel and therefore against them since  they are doing nothing

what you may not be taking into account is that the jp is no longer representative of the mainstream in israel

it was purchased a few years ago and in the battle for control most of the liberal and leftwing reporters walked out

the new owner stated in the past more than once that the jps task should be geared towards explaining and promoting israels position more than attacking the govt likud at the time

the paper that i would recommend reading being middle stream and factual is haaretz  or at least this was the case two years ago

 the average bias of what you read would be probably around   while that of the average american would be the same if they do  not read or read the newyork times and similar newsmakers and   if they read some other relatively less biased newspapers

and what about the natl enquirer

 but seriously if one were to read some of the leftist newspapers one could arrive at other conclusions

zionism agrees with the basic tenet of antisemitism namely that jews cannot live with non jews

wrong

zionism acknowledges the fact that antisemites exist and prevent jews from living in peace

that does not mean we agree that jews are all greedy that jews kill christian children commited deicide or anything else

i went straight to the kitchen and he called me mamma is there a soccer game

there were shouts from lenin street

thats where we lived

i say i dont know igor i havent turned on the tv

he looked again and said mamma whats going on in the courtyard

i look and see so many people its awful marching marching there are hundreds thousands you cant even tell how many there are

theyre shouting down with the armenians

kill the armenians

tear the armenians to pieces

my god why is that happening what for

i had known nothing at that point

we lived together well in friendship and suddenly something like this

it was completely unexpected

and they were shouting long live turkey

and they had flags and they were shouting

there was a man walking in front well dressed hes around  or  in a gray raincoat

he is walking and saying something i cant make it out through the vent window

he is walking and saying something and the children behind him are shouting tear the armenians to pieces

and down with the armenians

they shout it again and then shout hurrah

the people streamed without end they were walking in groups and in the groups i saw that there were women too

i say my god there are women there too

and my son says those arent women mamma those are bad women

well we didnt look a long time

they were walking and shouting and i was afraid i simply couldnt sit still

i went out onto the balcony and my azerbaijani neighbor is on the other balcony and i say khalida whats going on what happened

she says emma i dont know i dont know i dont know what happened

well she was quite frightened too

they had these white sticks each second or third one had a white rod

theyre waving the rods above their heads as they walk and the one whos out front like a leader he has a white stick too

well maybe it was an armature shaft but what i saw was white i dont know

my husband got home  or  minutes later

he comes home and i say oh dear im frightened theyre going to kill us i bet

and he says what are you afraid of theyre just children

i say everything that happens comes from children

there had been  and year kids from the technical and vocational school

dont fear he said its nothing nothing all that bad

he didnt eat he just lay on the sofa

and just then on television they broadcast that two azerbaijanis had been killed in karabakh near askeran

when i heard that i couldnt settle down at all i kept walking here and there and i said theyre going to kill us the azerbaijanis are going to kill us

and he says dont be afraid

then we heardfrom the central square there are women shouting near near the stage well theyre shouting different things and you couldnt hear every well

i say you speak azerbaijani well listen to what theyre saying

he says close the window and go to bed there s nothing happening there

he listened a bit and then closed the window and went to bed and told us come on go to sleep its nothing

sleep what did he mean sleep

my son and i stood at the window until two in the morning watching

well hes sick and all of this was affecting him

i say igor you go to bed im going to go to bed in a minute too

he went and i sat at the window until three and then went to bed

things had calmed down slightly

the th sunday was my day off

my husband got up and said come on emma get up

i say todays my day off let me rest

he says arent you going to make me some tea

well i felt startled and got up and said where are you going

he says im going out i have to

i say can you really go outside on a day like today

dont go out for gods sake

you never listen to me i know and youre not going to listen to me now but at least dont take the car out of the garage go without the car

and he says come on close the door

and then on the staircase he muttered something i couldnt make it out he probably said coward or something

i closed the door and he left

and i started cleaning 





picking things up around the house 





everything seemed quiet until one oclock in the after noon but at the bus station my neighbor told me cars were burning

i said khalida was it our car

she says no no emma dont be afraid they were government cars and zhigulis

our car is a gaz volga

and i waited it was four oclock five oclock 





and when he wasnt home at seven i said oh theyve killed shagen

tires are burning in town theres black smoke in town and im afraid im standing on the balcony and im all 





my whole body is shaking

my god theyve probably killed him

so basically i waited like that until ten oclock and he still hadnt come home

and im afraid to go out

at ten oclock i look out across from our building is a building with a bookstore and from upstairs from the second floor everything is being thrown outside

im looking out of one window and igor is looking out of the other and i dont want him to see this and he as it turns out doesnt want me to see it

we wanted to hide it from one another

i joined him

mamma he says look what theyre doing over there

they were burning everything and there were police standing there  or  of them maybe twenty policemen standing on the side and the crowd is on the other side and two or three people are throwing everything down from the balcony

and one of the ones on the balcony is shouting what are you standing there for burn it

when they threw the television wow it was like a bomb

our neighbor on the third floor came out on her balcony and shouted why are you doing that why are you burning those things those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their home

why are you burning them

and from the courtyard they yell at her go inside go inside

instead why dont you tell us if they are any of them in your building or not

they meant armenians but they didnt say armenians they said of them

she says no no no none

then she ran downstairs to our place and says emma emma you have to leave

i say theyve killed shagen anyway what do we have to live for

it wont be living for me without shagen

let them kill us too

she insists saying emma get out of here go to khalidas and give me the key

when they come ill say that its my daughters apartment that theyre off visiting someone

i gave her the key and went to the neighbors but i couldnt endure it

i say igor you stay here im going to go downstairs and see maybe papas 





papas there

meanwhile they were killing the two brothers alik and valery albert and valery avanesians see the accounts of rima avanesian and alvina baluian in the courtyard

there is a crowd near the building theyre shouting howling and i didnt think that they were killing at the time

alik and valery lived in the corner house across from ours

when i went out into the courtyard i saw an azerbaijani our neighbor a young man about  years old

i say madar uncle shagens gone lets go see maybe hes dead in the garage or near the garage lets at least bring the corpse into the house

he shouts aunt emma where do you think youre going

go back into the house ill look for him

i say something will happen to you too because of me no madar im coming too

well he wouldnt let me go all the same he says you stay here with us im go look

he went and looked and came back and said aunt emma theres no one there the garage is closed

madar went off again and then returned and said aunt emma theyre already killed alik and valerys there 





wheezing

madar wanted to go up to him but those scoundrels said dont go near him or well put you next to him

he got scaredhes youngand came back and said im going to go call maybe an ambulance will come at least to take alik maybe hell live 





they grew up together in our courtyard they knew each other well they had always been on good terms

he went to call but not a single telephone worked they had all been shut off

he called and called and called and callednothing

i went upstairs to the neighbors

igor says two police cars drove up over there their headlights are on but theyre not touching them they are still lying where they were theyre still lying there 





we watched out the window until four oclock and then went downstairs to our apartment

i didnt take my clothes off

i lay on the couch so as not to go to bed and at six oclock in the morning i got up and said igor you stay here at home dont go out dont go anywhere im going to look i have to find papa dead or alive 





let me go 





ive got the keys from work

at six oclock i went to the emergency hospital

the head doctor and another doctor opened the door to the morgue

i run up to them and say doctor is shagen there

he says what do you mean

why should shagen be here

i wanted to go in but he wouldnt let me

there were only four people in there they said

well they must have been awful because they didnt let me in

they said shagens not here hes alive somewhere hell come back

its already seven oclock in the morning

i look and there is a panel truck with three policemen

some of our people from the hospital were there with them

i say sara baji sister sara term of endearment go look theyve probably brought shagen

i said it shouted it and she went and came back and says no emma he has tan shoes on its a younger person

now shagen just happened to have tan shoes light tan they were already old

when they said it like that i guessed immediately

i went and said doctor theyve brought shagen in dead

he says why are you carrying on like that dead dead 





hes alive

but then he went all the same and when he came back the look on his face was 





i could tell immediately that he was dead

they knew one another well shagen had worked for him a long time

i say doctor is it shagen

he says no emma its not he its somebody else entirely

i say doctor why are you deceiving me ill find out all the same anyway if not today then tomorrow

and he said 





i screamed right there in the office

he says emma go go calm down a little

another one of our colleagues said that the doctor had said it was shagen but 





in hideous condition

they tried to calm me down saying it wasnt shagen

a few minutes later another colleague comes in and says oh poor emma

when she said it like that there was no hope left

that day was awful

they were endlessly bringing in dead and injured people

at night someone took me home

i said igor papas been killed

on the morning of the st i left igor at home again and went to the hospital i had to bury him somehow do something

i look and see that the hospital is surrounded by soldiers

they are wearing dark clothes

hey citizen where are you going

i say i work here and from inside someone shouts yes yes thats our cook let her in

i went right to the head doctors office and there is a person from the city health department there he used to work with us at the hospital

he says emma shagens been taken to baku

in the night they took the wounded and the dead all of them to baku

i say doctor how will i bury him

he says were taking care of all that dont you worry well do everything well tell you about it

where did you spend the night

i say i was at home

he says what do you mean you were at home

you were at home alone

i say no igor was there too

he says you cant stay home were getting an ambulance right now wait just one second the head doctor is coming were arranging an ambulance right now you put on a lab coat and take one for igor you go and bring igor here like a patient and youll stay here and well se later what to do next  his last name is kagramanov

the head doctors name is izyat jamalogli sadukhov

the ambulance arrived and i went home and got igor

they admitted him as a patient they gave us a private room an isolation room

we stayed in the hospital until the th

some police car came and they said emma lets go

and the women our colleagues then they saw the police car became anxious and said where are you taking her

i say theyre going to kill me too 





and the investigator says why are you saying that were going to make a positive identification

we went to baku and they took me into the morgue 





i still cant remember what hospital it was 





the investigator says lets go we need to be certain maybe its not shagen

and when i saw the caskets lying on top of one another i went out of my mind

i say i cant look no

the investigator says are there any identifying marks

i say let me see the clothes or the shoes or even a sock ill recognize them

he says isnt theyre anything on his body

i say he has seven gold teeth and his finger he only has half of one of his fingers

shagen was a carpenter he had been injured at work 





they brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing they brought them and they were all burned 





when i saw them i shouted oh they burned him

i shouted i dont know i fell down 





or maybe i sat down i dont remember

and that investigator says well fine fine since weve identified that these are his clothes and since his teeth 





since he has seven gold teeth 





on the th they told me emma its time to bury shagen now

i cried how how can i bury shagen when i have only one son and hes sick

i should inform his relatives he has three sisters i cant do it by myself

they say ok you know the situation

how will they get here from karabagh

how will they get here from yerevan

theres no transportation it s impossible

he was killed on february  and i buried him on march 

we buried him in sumgait

they asked me where do you want to bury him

i said i want to bury him in karabagh where we were born let me bury him in karabagh im shouting and the head of the burial office i guess says do you know what it means take him to karabagh

it means arson

i say what do you mean arson

dont they know whats going on in karabagh

the whole world knows that they killed them and i want to take him to karabagh i dont have anyone anymore

i begged i pleaded i grieved i even got down on my knees

he says lets bury him here now and in three months in six months a year if it calms down ill help you move him to karabagh 





our trial was the first in sumgait

it was concluded on may 

at the investigation the murderer tale ismailov told how it all happened but then at the trial he 





tried to wriggle 





he tried to soften his crime

then they brought a videotape recorder i guess and played it and said ismailov look is that you

he says yes

well look here youre describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime right

he says yes

and now youre telling it differently

he says well maybe i forgot

like that

the witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along mir street there was a crowd of about  people 





shagen had a volga gaz

the  people surrounded his car and all  of them were involved

one of them was this ismailov guy this tale

theyits unclear whostarted pulling shagen out of the car

well one says from the left side of the car another says from the right side

they pulled off his sports jacket

he had a jacket on

well they ask him whats your nationality

he says armenian

well they say from the crowd they shouted if hes an armenian kill him kill him

they started beating him they broke seven of his ribs and his heart 





i dont know they did something there too 





its too awful to tell about

anyway they say this tale guy 





he had an armature shaft

he says i picked it up it was lying near a bush thats where i got it

he said he picked it up but the witnesses say that he had already had it

he said i hit him twice he said  





once or twice on the head with that rod

and he said that when he started to beat him shagen was sitting on the ground and when he hit him he fell over

he said i left right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment killing someone he says and i came back to look is that shagen alive or not

i said you wanted to finish him right and if he was still alive you came back to hit him again

he went back and looked and he was already dead

after that that bastard tale said after that i went home

i said you 





you 





little snake i said are you a thief and a murderer

shagen had had money in his jacket and a watch on his wrist

they were taken

he says he didnt take them when they overturned and burned the car that tale was no longer there it was other people who did that

who it was who turned over the car and who burned it that hasnt been clarified as yet

i told the investigator how can you have the trial when you dont know who burned the car

he said something but i didnt get what he was saying

but i said you still havent straightened everything out i think thats unjust

when they burned the car he was lying next to it and the fire spread to him

in the death certificate it says that he had thirddegree burns over  percent of his body 





and i ask again why was he killed

my husband was a carpenter he was a good craftsman he knew how to do everything he even fixed his own car with his own hands

we have three children

three sons

only igor was with me at the time

the older one was in pyatigorsk and the younger one is serving in the army

and now theyre fatherless

i couldnt sit all the way through it

when the procurator read up to  years deprivation of freedom i just 





i went out of my mind i didnt know what to do with myself i said how can that be

you i said you are saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is  years deprivation of freedom

i screamed i had my mind

i said let me at that creep with my bare hands ill 





a relative restrained me and there were all those military people there 





i lest

i said this isnt a soviet trial this is unjust

thats what i shouted l said it and left 





i said that on february  when those people were streaming down our street they were shouting long live turkey

and glory to turkey

and during the trial i said to that ismailov what does that mean glory to turkey

i still dont understand what turkey has to do with this we live in the soviet union

that turkey told you to or is going to help you kill armenians

i still dont understand why glory to turkey

i asked that question twice and got no answer 





no one answered me

box   even explain 

cambridge ma   turkish mp march

hmm

maybe ill go rent midnight express tonight

i havent seen that scene in awhile i have to savor the moment all over again

well does it change the fact that during the period of  to  the fascist xsoviet armenian government ordered incited assisted and participated in the genocide of 

million muslim people because of race religion and national origin

as in the past in turkiye and today in azerbaijan for utopic and idiotic causes the armenians brought havoc to their neighbors

a shortsighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the armenians continue to become pernicious for the region

as usual they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors

nagornokarabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to xsoviet armenia

besides the geographical aspect nagornokarabag is the historic homeland and the cradle of the artistic and literary heritage of azerbaijan which renders the armenian claims preposterous even lunatic

and we still demand 

that the xsoviet armenian government as the heirs of the armenian dictatorship recognize the turkish genocide 

that xsoviet armenia return the historic homeland to the turkish and kurdish people 

that the xsoviet armenian government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the turkish genocide 

that all world governments officially recognize the turkish genocide and turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all armenian political pressure

the awareness of the turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the turkish cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the th century as a positive step

now what would you do

source the sunday times  march  a british weekly written by thomas goltz from agdam azerbaijan

armenian soldiers massacre hundreds of fleeing families

the spiralling violence gripping the outer republics of the former soviet union gained new impetus yesterday with coldblooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in warracked nagornokarabakh

survivors reported that armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more than  azeris many of them women and children who were fleeing an attack on their town

hundreds possibly thousands were missing and feared dead

the attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the women and children

they then turned their guns on the terrified refugees

the few survivors later described what happened thats when the real slaughter began said azer hajiev one of three soldiers to survive

the armenians just shot and shot

and then they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives

they were shooting shooting shooting echoed rasia aslanova who arrived in agdam with other women and children who made their way through armenian lines

she said her husband kayun and a soninlaw were killed in front of her

her daughter was still missing

one boy who arrived in agdam had an ear sliced off

the survivors said  others some of whom had fled separately were still missing in the gruelling terrain many could perish from their wounds or the cold

by late yesterday  deaths had been registered at the morgue in agdams morgue and  bodies had been buried in the cemetery

of the seven corpses i saw awaiting burial two were children and three were women one shot through the chest at point blank range

agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror

doctors said they had  patients who escaped slaughter most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds

nor were they safe in agdam

on friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of  destroying several buildings and killing one person

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

 i have previously posted quotations by irgun participants that totally destroys begins whitewash

i have no particular desire to post it yet again

 brendan

normally bdmcsanueduau you apparently think you are some sort of oneman judge and jury who can declare total victory and then sit back and enjoy the applause

but youve picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged quotations can sustain the legend and lie of the deir yassin massacre

you have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology

at the most basic level you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding quotations that support your preset opinions

if you have studied the history of israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your quotations have an axe to grind and therefore you must be very careful about whom you quote

for example meir pail whom you cite was indeed a general a scholar and a war hero

but that doesnt mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold

in fact and here your lack of experience shows pail is such a fanatic embittered leftist that much of his antiisrael blathering forget about antiirgun blathering would be considered something like treason in nonisrael contexts

but of course you dont consider this at all when you find a juicy quotation that you can use to attack israel

benny morris of hashomer hatzair represents himself as a scholar when he rehashes the old attacks on the irgun

dont be fooled

its just the old zionist ideological catfight surfacing as an attack on the then likud government

if you will look closely at the section on deir yassin in his book on the war of independence you will see his indictment to be pure hot air

and this is the best he can do after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence

unfortunately for him because his book parades itself as scholarly he is forced to put footnotes

so you can clearly see that his deir yassin account is based on nothing

the deir yassin massacre never took place as the propagandists tell it any more than the sabra and shatila massacres

do you get the feeling people like to blame the jews for massacres even if they have to make them up

it must sound spicy

even some jews like to do it for reasons of their own

please dont confuse any of you deir yassin massacre stuff with facts or scholarship

you should stick to begins version unless you find something serious to contradict it

in article aprdasharvardedu  adamendoruucp adam shostack writes  in article aprbnrca zbibbnrca writes imho it does not really matter who started any individual battle within the arabsisreal war context

the real question is whowhat started the war

does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of israel on arab land 

 huh

a war was started when several armies invaded israel vowing to drive the jews into the sea

most jews wanted to live in peace and the arabs who stayed in israel were granted citizenship

 i am surprised that you dont consider the acquisition of land by the jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to war

it was for the purpose of establishing a state not an exclusive state

if the state was to be exclusive it would not have   arab citizens

and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action

when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce

it is not a hostile action leading to war

as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace maybe

however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish state where jews are in control and jews are the masters of the land

living in peace is meaningless unless it means living with someone else as equal

for a native arab this does not leave many options

oh you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens

the arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the jews

those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective minority

if i were wrong youd have israel recall all the palestinian refugees were talking millions

after all they are civilians

huh

the people who left did so voluntarily

there is no reason for israel to let them in

israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing

israel got no western aid in  nor in  or it still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained

and how is granting citizenship a facade

 tell me something sam

what makes land arab

how shall i explain its a contract between the man and the land

control isnt it

the ottomans ruled  years and then left with barely a trace

the concept of land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west

it is partly the concept of le sol natal native soil

i know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent memory

im talking everyday life not archeology

try again you tell me what its isnt but you fail to establish what it is

also jews did have history in israel for over a thousand years

there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel

there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly 

jews were a majority in jerusalem from  or so onwards

does that make the land jewish

most of brads post deleted

we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw

tell me do these young men also attack syrian troops

with the blood of its soldiers

if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land

there must be a guarantee of peace before this happens

it seems that many of these lebanese youth are unable to restrain themselves from violence and unable to to realize that their actions prolong israels stay in south lebanon

if the lebanese army was able to maintain the peace then israel would not have to be there

until it is israel prefers that its soldiers die rather than its children

if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the socalled security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks

such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israels public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions

israel should withdraw from lebanon when a peace treaty is signed

not a day before

withdraw because of casualties would tell the lebanese people that all they need to do to push israel around is kill a few soldiers

its not gonna happen

along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it

why should israel not demand this while holding the buffer zone

it seems to me that the better bargaining position is while holding your neighbors land

if lebanon were willing to agree to those conditions israel would quite probably have left already

unfortunately it doesnt seem that the lebanese can disarm the hizbolah and maintain the peace

perhaps you can answer the question as to why the adl maintained files and spied on adc members in california and elsewhere

friendly rivalry perhaps

most if not all arabs are sympathetic to the palestinian war against israel

that is why the adl monitors arab organizations

that is the same reason the us monitored communist organizations and soviet nationals only a few years ago

 the adc is an organization of arabamericans

let me seeyoure saying that most if not all arabamericans should be spied on

youre also saying that most if not all arabamericans should be views as a national security threat to israel and the us as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the wtc bombing in which no arabamericans were involved

by inference can we assume that you think that anyone of arab lineage anywhere in the world poses a threat to israel and therefore should be spied on

perhaps then on the basis of pollard spy case not to mention the rosenbergs etc

you think that all jewish americans should be spied on by the adc

oh never mind this whole spying case has obviously so convoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that i have no wish confuse you further

perhaps yigal is a greenpeace member

or the naacp

or a reporter

or a member of any of the dozens of other political organizationsethnic minoritiesoccupations that the adl spied on

 all of these groups have in the past associated with or been a part of anti israel activity or propoganda

the adl is simply monitoring them so that if anything comes up they wont be caught by surprise

so the la times reporter who had information about him sold to the south african government was involved in antiisrael activity or propaganda

are we to infer that the simple act of reporting an event in a newspaper constitutes antiisrael activity or propaganda

or was it south africa

the la times reporter was based in south africa after all

 amir y rosenblatt writes   sam zbib writes  no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity

 palestinians are no exception

perhaps you heard about  antitrust in the business world

   since we are debating the legality of a commercial  transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines  and ethics of such transactions

basic antitrust law says  that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of  investing you can not acquire a large number of those  shares with the intent or controlling ibm

you can do so  only if you make your intentions clear apriori 

clearly  the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some  designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate

 they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews

   the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the  old tradition of arab hospitality

being a multiethnic   multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours  was no different just another religion

plus they paid fair  market value etc

they did not know they were victims of  an international conspiracy

im not a conspiracy theorist  myself but this one is hard to dismiss

   right now im just going to address this point

when the jewish national fund bought most of its land it didnt buy it from the palestinians themselves because for the most part they were tenant farmers fallahin living on land owned by wealthy arabs in syria and lebanon

the jnf offered a premium deal so the owners took advantage of it

its called commerce

the owners however made no provisions for those who had worked for them basically shafting them by selling the land right out from under them

they are to blame not the jews

   amir why would you categorize the sale of land as shafting

was it because it was sold to jews

was it fair to assume that the fallahin would be mistreated by the jews

is this the norm of any commerce read shafting between arabs and jews

it was shafting on the part of the arab land owners for doing it without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible enough to make provisions for them but rather just leaving them to their fate

 your claim that the lebanesesyrian landlords sold palestine if true even partially omits the fact that the mandate treaty put lebanon and syria under french rule while palestine under british

obiviously any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in palestine and would be motivated to sell regardless of the price

the point is that the land was sold legally often at prices above its actual value

it was legal and good business for the sellers though it left the palestinians who worked the land in a poor situation

 it is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted

do many israelis or jews share your opinion 

do you absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it wasnt written down

i dont know if others share this opinion

it is mine and im sure there are some who agree and some who dont the way i see it the fallahin were caught in circumstances beyond their control in that since they didnt own the land they didnt have a say

of course now for the sake of the greater arab unity the arabs are angry that the land was sold to the jews an act that is illegal in jordan but when it happened it was just business

 all told i did not see an answer in your response

the question was whether the intent behind the purchase was aimed at controlling the public assets land infrastructure etc imho the palestinians have grounds to contest the legality of the purchase say in world court

 sam   my opinions are my own and no one elses the purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for jewish immigrants

in any case no matter what the purpose the sales were legal so i really dont see any grounds for contesting them

 from the israeli press newspaper haaretz date  february author gideon levi subject nazi methods in gaza title in the neighborhood of hope among the rubble excerpts mahmoud jowarar stared at me long and sadly i worked my entire life in order to built that house and this is what is left

only tv could transmit the full sadness of his face

you say that we teach our children to hate you but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this 

and once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence his face crumbling into weeping

mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home

the term dispossession has an absolute meaning here

nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings

once again khan yunis

once again demolished homes

last thursday there was a search for wanted people here

once again the idf forces employed the new method fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives

already three times during the past weeks i have gone out to see the destruction and each time i was more horrifying scenes

this time they hit the largest number of houses  according to the idf estimate ten of them completely demolished

but not only that the method has also become more brutal

three weeks ago in tufah neighborhood in gaza the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes

this time the army skipped that part three weeks ago the handcuffed men inhabitants of the demolished homes were supplied with some water and one apple during the  hours they had to stand

this time there was only water

three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet

this time the soldier just gold them piss and shit in your pants

and thus last thursday some  men stood for about  hours their hands bound behind their backs their eyes blindfolded without food with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes one after the other

 dr jumaa fuad said alrubi

the brother from saudi arabia emerges from among the ruins

ten days ago he arrived for a family visit mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with his father and brothers

on thursday he was handcuffed like everyone else for  hours and later went with everyone to view the destrucion

he tried to explain that he was a visitor and that he is a physician but only got a shove

like all the rest he also urinated in his pants while standing with his hands bound and his eyes blindfolded for the entire day

jumaa alrubi studied medicine at cairo university and for ten years he has been treating wealthy saudis in medina

his wife and four children remained there

now his documents have been lost and he does not know how he will return to them

there is no humanity stated the physician from saudi arabia

the idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage is not conventional

however it is based on the concept of affirmative action which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination

other people have already shown this to be a rediculous proposal

however i wanted to point out that there are many people who do not think that affirmative action is a either intelligent or productive

it is demeaning to those who it supposedly helps and it is discriminatory

any proposal based on it is likely bunk as well

we paid for it in human casualties and crippled fatesthe price was too great

now after the sumgait tragedy we the victims divide our lives into before and after

we talk like that that was before the war

like the people who went through world war ii and considered it a whole epoch a fate

no matter how many years go by no matter how long we live it will never be forgotten

on the contrary some of the moments become even sharper in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now 





they say that you can see more with distance and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now 





we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened

nineteen eightyeight was a leap year

everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible

yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every sumgait armenian those who lost someone and those who didnt

that second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you could already smell danger in the air

but we didnt think that the danger was near and possible so we didnt take any steps to save ourselves

at least as my parents say at least we should have done something to save the children

my parents themselves are not that old  and  years

but then they thought that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save us

in our apartment the tragedy started on february  around five in the afternoon

i call it a tragedy and i repeat it was a tragedy even though all our family survived

when i recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls even now among armenians among people who wish me only well i feel like its all starting over again

i remember how that mob broke into our apartment 





my parents were standing in the hall

my father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors

our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by

were known as a hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were azerbaijanis jews or russians

we had friends of many nationalities even a turkmen woman

my parents were in the hall my father with an axe

i remember him telling my mother run to the kitchen for a knife

but mother was detached pale as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer

to be honest i never expected it of her shes afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark

a girlfriend was at the house that day a russian girl lyuda and mamma said no matter what happens no matter what they do to us youre not to come out of the bedroom

were going to tell them that were alone in the apartment

we went into the bedroom

there were four of us

marina and the russian girl crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and karina and i are standing there and looking at one another

the idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me

im an emotional person and i express my emotions immediately

i wanted to embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last second

and maybe karina was thinking the same thing but shes quite reserved

we didnt have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard mamma raise a shout

there was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from excited voices

i couldnt figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack

but when mamma shouted the second time karina ran out of the bedroom

i ran after her i had wanted to hold her back but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately

the only thing i managed to do was close the door behind me at least so as to save marina and her friend

the mob was shouting all of their eyes were shining all red like from insomnia

at first about  people burst in but later i was standing with my back to the door and couldnt see

they came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other room

he didnt utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but mamma snatched the axe from behind and said tell them not to touch the children

tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the children

she said this to father in armenian

there were azerbaijanis from armenia among the mob who broke in

they understood armenian perfectly

the local azerbaijanis dont know armenian they dont need to speak it

and one of them responded in armenian you and your children both 





were going to do the same thing to you and your children that you armenians did in kafan

they killed our women our girls our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses 





 and so on and so forth and we came to do the same thing to you

this whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us

they were mostly young people under 

at first there werent any older people among them

and all of their faces were unfamiliar

sumgait is a small town all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me im a teacher

so they dragged my father into the other room

they twisted his arms and took him in there no they didnt take him in there they dragged him in there because he was already unable to walk

they closed the door to that room all but a crack

we couldnt see what was happening to father what they were doing to him

then a young man about  years old started to tear off mammas sarafan and mamma shouted at him in azerbaijani im old enough to be your mother

what are you doing

he struck her

now hes being held mamma identified him

i hope hes convicted

then they went after karina whos been talking to them like a komsomol leader as though she were trying to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their consciousness

she told them that what they were doing was wrong that they mustnt do it

she said come on lets straighten this out without emotions

what do you want

who are you

why did you come here

what did we ever do to you

someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home but then the ones in the backmore of them kept coming and comingsaid what are you talking to them for

you should kill them

we came here to kill them

they pushed karina struck her and she fell down

they beat her but she didnt cry out

even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating what did we do to you

what did we do to you

and even later when she came to she said mamma what did we do to them

why did they do that to us

that group was prepared i know this because i noticed that some of them only broke up furniture and others only dealt with us

i remember that when they were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to karina

all i could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they did to her

thats why i felt no pain

later when they carried karina off they beat her savagely 





its really amazing that she not only lived but didnt lose her mind 

she is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty

mostly they beat her face with their fists kicking her using anything they could find

mamma karina and i were all in one room

and again i didnt feel any pain just didnt feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they did

then one of those creeps said that there wasnt enough room in the apartment

they broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room

then someone suggested lets take her outside

those beasts were in heaven

they did what they would do every day if they werent afraid of the authorities

those were their true colors

at the time i thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they werent afraid of what would happen to them

when they carried karina out and beat mammaher face was completely covered with bloodthats when i started to feel the pain

i blacked out several times from the pain but each moment that i had my eyes open it was as though i were recording it all on film

i think im a kind person by nature but im vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and i dont deserve it

i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain

and every time i would come to and see one of those animals on top of me id remember them and ill remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me forget you have to forget you have to go on living

at some point i remember that they stood me up and told me something and despite the fact that i hurt all overi had been beaten terriblyi found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures

i realized that i had to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end

i pushed one of them away he was a real horse

i remember now that hes being held too

as though they were all waiting for it they seized me and took me out onto the balcony

i had long hair and it was stuck all over me

one of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and i realized that they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up with their hands i was up in the air

as though for the last time i took a really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside i suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet

and suddenly i felt myself flying

i couldnt figure out if i was really flying or if i just imagined it

when i came to i thought now im going to smash on the ground

and when it didnt happen i opened my eyes and realized that i was still lying on the floor

and since i didnt scream didnt beg them at all they became all the more wild like wolves

they started to trample me with their feet

shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe cially put them on

then i lost consciousness

i came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched it

some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment i didnt need any of those things

i was sure that none of us would survive and i had even forgotten about marina and if none of us was alive it wasnt worth living

there was a moment when the pain was especially great

i withstood inhuman pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because i had showed myself to be so tenacious

i started to strangle myself and when i started to wheeze they realized that with my death i was going to put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my throat

the person who injured and insulted me most painfully i remember him very well because he was the oldest in the group

he looked around 

i know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a thing

something came over him then you see even during the investigation he almost called me daughter he apologized although of course he knew that id never forgive him

something like that i can never forgive

i have never injured anyone with my behavior with my words or with my deeds i have always put myself in the other persons shoes but then in a matter of hours they trampled me entirely

i shall never forget it

i wanted to do myself in then because i had nothing to lose because no one could protect me

my father who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself could do nothing and wouldnt be able to do anything

i knew that i was even sure that he was no longer alive

and ira melkumian my acquaintance i knew her and had been to see her family a couple of timesher brother tried to save her and couldnt so he tried to kill her his very own sister

he threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering

when they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room her brother knew what awaited her

i dont know which one it was edik or igor

both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown

but the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in sumgait

i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumians landing

his name is makhaddin he knows my family a little

he came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in baku how we were feeling and if we needed anything

hes a good person

he said you should praise god that you all survived

but what i saw with my own eyes i a man who has seen so many people die who has lived a whole life i he says nearly lost my mind that day

i had never seen the likes of it and think i never shall again

the door to his apartment was open and he saw everything

one of the brothers threw the axe because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment

igor edik and ira remained

he saw ira naked being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people

he told us about it and said he would never forget it

he heard the brothers shouting something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that they were powerless to do anything

but all the same they tried to do something

the guy who got hit with the axe lived

i i after i had been unsuccessful at killing myself i saw them taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom

i was in such a state that i couldnt even remember my sisters name

i wanted to cry marina

out to her but could not

i looked at her and knew that it was a familiar dear face but couldnt for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was

and thus i saved her because when they were taking her out she as it turns out had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and lyuda were both there by chance that they werent armenians

lyudas a russian you can tell right away and marina speaks azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an azerbaijani

and i almost gave her away and doomed her

im glad that at least marina came out of this all in good physical health 





although her spirit was murdered 





at some point i came to and saw igor igor agayev my acquaintance in that mob

he lives in the neighboring building

for some reason i remembered his name maybe i sensed my defense in him

i called out to him in russian igor help

but he turned away and went into the bedroom

just then they were taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom

igor said he knew marina and lyuda that marina in fact was azerbaijani and he took both of them to the neighbors

and the idea stole through me that maybe igor had led them to our apartment something like that but if he was my friend he was supposed to save me

then they were striking me very hardwe have an indian vase a metal one they were hitting me on the back with it and i blacked outthey took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window

they were already sure that i was dead because i didnt react at all to the new blows

someone said shes already dead lets throw her out

when they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time when i was about to die the second time i heard someone say in azerbaijani dont kill her i know her shes a teacher

i can still hear that voice ringing in my ears but i cant remember whose voice it was

it wasnt igor because he speaks azerbaijani with an accent his mother is russian and they speak russian at home

he speaks azerbaijani worse than our marina does

i remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and i having opened my eyes saw and recognized that person but immediately passed out cold

i had been beaten so much that i didnt have the strength to remember him

i only remember that this person was older and he had a high position

unfortunately i cant remember anything more

what should i say about igor

he didnt treat me badly

i had heard a lot about him that he wasnt that good a person that he sometimes drank too much

once he boasted to me that he had served in afghanistan

he knew that women usually like bravery in a man

especially if a man was in afghanistan if he was wounded then its about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically with respect

later i found out that he had served in ufa and was injured but thats not in afghanistan of course

i found that all out later

among the people who were in our apartment my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization

i dont know his last name his first name is najaf he is an armenianborn azerbaijani

but later karina wasnt so sure she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw and she didnt want to endanger him

she said he was there and a little while later maybe they beat me so much that i am confusing him with someone else

no it seems like it was he

i am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing and the next time he said something entirely different

the investigators havent summoned him yet

he came to see us in the khimik boarding house where we were living at the time

he brought groceries and flowers this was right before march th he almost started crying he was so upset to see our condition

i dont know if he was putting us on or not but later after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the procuracy he said that he had been in baku he wasnt in sumgait

the fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that karina is right that in fact it was he who was in our apartment

i dont know how the investigators are now treating him

at one point i wondered and asked and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment

couldnt he have gone to baku and arranged an alibi

im not ruling out that possibility

ill now return to our apartment

mamma had come to

you could say that she bought them off with the gold father gave her when they were married her wedding band and her watch were gold

she bought her own and her husbands lives with them

she gave the gold to a year old boy

vadim vorobyev

a russian boy he speaks azerbaijani perfectly

hes an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in sumgait on nizami street

he goes to a special school one for mentally handicapped children

but ill say thisim a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes i can form an opinionthat boy is not at all mentally handicapped

hes healthy he can think just fine and analyze too 





policemen should be so lucky

and hes cunning too

after that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album

he beat mamma and demanded gold saying lady if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment well let you live

and mamma told them where the gold was

he brought in the bag and opened it shook out the contents and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another

im surprised they didnt kill one another right then

mamma was still in control of herself

she had been beaten up her face was black and blue from the blows and her eyes were filled with blood and she ran into the other room

father was lying there tied up with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face

there was a broken table on top of the pil low

mamma grabbed father and he couldnt walk like me he was half dead halfway into the other world

he couldnt comprehend anything couldnt see and was covered with black and blue

mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth it was some sort of cloth i think it was a slipcover from an armchair

the bandits were still in our apartment even in the room mamma pulled father out of led him out of carried him out of

we had two armchairs in that room a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen

three people were standing next to that screen and into their shirts their pants everywhere imaginable they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee servicemamma saw them out of the corner of her eye

she said i was afraid to turn around i just seized father and started pulling him but at the threshold i couldnt hold him up he fell down and i picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors

mamma remembered one of the criminals the one who had watched her with his face halfturned toward her out of one eye

she says i realized that my death would come from that person

i looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing

later they caught that scoundrel

meanwhile mamma grabbed father and left

i was alone

igor had taken marina away mamma and father were gone karina was already outside i didnt know what they were doing to her

i was left all alone and at that moment 





i became someone else do you understand

even though i knew that neither mother and father in the other room nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me all the same i somehow managed to hold out

i went on fighting them i bit someone i remember and i scratched another

but when i was left alone i realized what kind of people they were the ones i had observed the ones who beat karina what kind of people they were the ones who beat me that it was all unnecessary that i was about to die and that all of that would die with me

at some point i took heart when i saw the young man from the next building

i didnt know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that we were from the same microdistrict

when i saw him i said neighbor is that you

in so doing i placed myself in great danger

he realized that if i lived i would remember him

thats when he grabbed the axe

the axe that had been taken from my father

i automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery

when he started getting ready to wind back for the blow someone came into the room

the newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbors axe froze in the air

everyone stood at attention for this guy like soldiers in the presence of a general

everyone waited for his word continue the atrocities or not

he said enough lets go to the third entryway

in the third entryway they killed uncle shurik aleksandr gambarian

this confirms once again that they had prepared in advance

almost all of them left with him as they went picking up pillows blankets whatever they needed whatever they found all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot someone else had already taken the other

four people remained in the room soldiers who didnt obey their general

they had to have come recently because other faces had flashed in front of me over those  to  hours but i had never seen those three

one of them kuliyev i identified him later a native of the sisian district of armenia an azerbaijani had moved to azerbaijan a year before

he told me in armenian sister dont be afraid ill drive those three azerbaijanis out of here

thats just what he said those azerbaijanis as though he himself were not azerbaijani but some other nationality he said with such hatred ill drive them out of here now and you put your clothes on and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut because theyll be coming back from apartment 

thats when i found out that they had gone to apartment 

before that the person in the eskimo dogskin coat the one who came in and whom they listened to the general said that they were going to the third entryway

kuliyev helped me get some clothes on because l couldnt do it by myself

marinas old fur coat was lying on the floor

he threw it over my shoulders i was racked with shivers and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer

he wanted to give them to me so that when he left i could nail the door shut

but the door was lying on the floor in the hall

i went out onto the balcony

there were broken windows and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor

it was impossible to find anything

he told me well fine i wont leave you here

would any of the neighbors let you in

theyll be back they wont calm down they know youre alive

he told me all this in armenian

then he returned to the others and said what are you waiting for

leave

they said ah you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself

no we want to do it to

he urged them on but gently not coarsely because he was alone against them although they were still just boys not old enough to be drafted

he led them out of the room and went down to the third floor with them himself and said leave

whats the mat ter arent you men

go fight with the men

what do you want of her

and he came back upstairs

they wanted to come up after him and he realized that he couldnt hold them off forever

then he asked me where he could hide me

i told him at the neighbors on the fourth floor apartment  we were on really good terms with them

we knocked on the door and he explained in azerbaijani

the neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said im an azerbaijani

he said i know

let her sit at your place a while

dont open the door to anyone no one knows about this i wont tell anyone

let her stay at your place

she says fine have her come in

i went in

she cried a bit and gave me some stockings i had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders

i burst into tears

even though i was wearing marinas old fur coat its a short one a halflength i was cold all the same

i asked do you know where my family is what happened to them

she says no i dont know anything

im afraid to go out of the apartment now theyre so wild that they dont look to see whos azerbaijani and whos armenian

kuliyev left

ten minutes later my neighbor says you know lyuda i dont want to lose my life because of you or my son and his wife

go stay with someone else

during the butchery in our apartment one of the scum a sadist took my earring in his mouthi had pearl earrings onand ripped it out tearing the earlobe

the other earring was still there

when im nervous i fix my hair constantly and then when i touched my ear i noticed that i had one earring on

i took it out and gave it to her

she took the earring but she led me out of the apartment

i went out and didnt know where to go

i heard someone going upstairs

i dont know who it was but assumed it was them

with tremendous difficulty i end up to our apartment i wanted to die in my own home

i go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place to the fifth floor

i had to do something

i went into the bedroom where marina and lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned

instead of hiding i squatted near some broken christmas ornaments found an unbroken one and started sobbing

then they came in

someone said that there were still some things to take

i think that someone pushed me under the bed

i lay on the floor and there were broken ornaments on it under my head and legs

i got all cut up but i lay there without moving

my heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it

there were no lights on

maybe thats what saved me

they were burning matches and toward the end they brought in a candle

they started picking out the clothes that could still be worn

they took fathers sport jacket and a bedspread the end of which was under my head

they pulled on the one end and it felt like they were pulling my hair out

i almost cried out

and again i realized i wasnt getting out of there alive and i started to strangle myself again

i took my throat in one hand and pressed the other on my mouth so as not to wheeze so that i would die and they would only find me afterward

they were throwing the burned matches under the bed and i got burned but i withstood it

something inside of me held on someones hand was protecting me to the end

i knew that i was going to die but i didnt know how

i knew that if i survived i would walk out of that apartment but if i found out that one of my family had died i would die for sure because i had never been so close to death and couldnt imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father or without your sister

marina i thought was still alive she went to lyudas place or someone is hiding her

i tried to think that igor wouldnt let them be killed

he served in afghanistan he should protect her

while i was strangling myself i said my goodbyes to everyone

and then i thought how could marina survive alone

if they killed all of us how would she live all by herself

there were six people in the room

they talked among themselves and smoked

one talked about his daughter saying that there was no childrens footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter

another said that he liked the apartmentrecently we had done a really good job fixing everything upand that he would live there after everything was all over

they started to argue

a third one says how come you get it

i have four children and there are three rooms here thats just what i need

all these years ive been living in godawful places

another one says neither of you gets it

well set fire to it and leave

then someone said that azerbaijanis live right next door the fire could move over to their place

and they to my good fortune didnt set fire to the apartment and left

oh yes i just remembered

while they were raping me they repeated quite frequently let the armenian women have babies for us muslim babies let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians

then they said those muslims can carry on our holy cause

heroes

they repeated it very often

in june  a major uprising took place in sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous nazi boyadjian

the moslem districts were burnt down

hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished

armenians first of all occupied the talori region which included the villages of siner simai gulliguzat ahi hedenk sinank ekind effard musson etek akcesser

leaving their wives children and property in these inaccessible spots the armenians joined forces with other armed bands coming from the silvan districts in the plain of mus after which the whole body of  men gathered in the andok mt

five or six hundred wished to surround mus and started off by attacking the delican tribe to the south of the city

they slaughtered a number of the tribe and seized their goods

the religious beliefs of the muslims who fell into their hands were derided and disparaged and the muslims themselves murdered in the most frightful manner

the rebels also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of mus but the large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from occupying the city

the rebels joined the bandits in the andok mts carrying out the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the neighbourhood

they burned omer aghas nephew alive

they raped a number of turkish women at a spot three or four hours distance from gulliguzat and then strangled them

at the beginning of august the rebels attacked the faninar bekiran and badikan tribes perpetrating equally horrible atrocities

the rebels in the villages of yermut and ealigernuk in the nahiye of cinan in the kaza of cal attacked the kurds in the neighbourhood as well as the villages of kaisser and catcat

towards the end of august the armenians attacked the kurds in the vicinity of mus and burned down three or four villages including gulliguzat

as for the  rebels in talori they continued to spread death and destruction among the muslims and other christian communities refusing to lay down their arms

it is interesting that you are basing the truth on israeli propaganda

 azeri president abulfaz elchibey said azerbaijan had recovered the bodies of some  terrorists including blacks mongols and fighters recently brought to the armenian capital yerevan from lebanon

you can dream whatever you wish

we have demands from the armenians

with the government of xsoviet armenia we would sit down go over all our outstanding issues whether its land or reparations or recognition whatever it is

wed like to sit down and ask for it

by all means lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners the turkish and kurdish people who were there  years long before the armenians ever showed up in that area

entire population of the region was subjected to genocide beyond belief genocide which was planned to exterminate the whole turkish people of the region to the last man woman and child

armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians

to assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings was one of their methods

even today the traveler in that region is seldom free from the evidence of these armenian crimes

if you have the stomach i would strongly recommend the following references on the armenian genocide of the muslims

 sam zbib writes im surprised that you dont consider the acquisition of land by the jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to war

 it was for the purpose of establishing a state not an  exclusive state

if the state was to be exclusive it would not have    arab citizens

could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed

 and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile  action

when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing  to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce

it  is not a hostile action leading to war

no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity

palestinians are no exception

perhaps you heard about antitrust in the business world

since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions

basic antitrust law says that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm

you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori 

clearly the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate

they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews

the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality

being a multiethnic  multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion

plus they paid fair market value etc

they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy

im not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss

as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace maybe

however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish state where jews are in control and jews are the masters of the land

living in peace is meaningless unless it means living with someone else as equal

for a native arab this does not leave many options

 oh you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens

the arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the jews

again adam the devil is in the details

i dont want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its ok to return  deportes and leave the rest

because  is a nice number that you can devide by   and besides it has an integer square root

those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective minority

if i were wrong youd have israel recall all the palestinian refugees were talking millions

after all they are civilians

 huh

the people who left did so voluntarily

there is no reason for israel to let them in

do you actually believe this

my experience tells me that every palestinian i knew still keeps the key to his home in palestine

besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell so to speak

i know none that agrees with you

did you sample their opinions

i know you dont care just being rethorical

israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing

 israel got no western aid in  nor in  or it still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained

and how is granting citizenship a facade

dont get me wrong

i beleive that israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group jews

israel probably had a few options after  ethnic cleansing serbian style and deserve the wrath of the international community or make the best out of a no win condition show the world how good israel is towards the bad arabs

personaly ive never heard anything about the arab community in isreal

except that theyre there

so yes theyre there

but as a community with history and roots its dead

 tell me something sam

what makes land arab

how shall i explain its a contract between the man and the land

control isnt it

the ottomans ruled  years and then left with barely a trace

the concept of land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west

it is partly the concept of le sol natal native soil

i know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent memory

im talking everyday life not archeology

 try again you tell me what its isnt but you fail to  establish what it is

 also jews did have history in israel for over a thousand years

there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel

there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly 

jews were a majority in jerusalem from  or so onwards

does that make the land jewish

i stand corrected

i meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in palestine in recent history

i have no problem with jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly jewish

so there

what to make of the rest palestine

 adam shostack adamdasharvardedu  sam zbib bellnorthern research  bitnetinternet zbibbnrca voice   fax   surface mail stop  pobox  station c ottawa canada ky h  my opinions are my own and no one elses

in article bimacsbitnet ehrlichbimacsbitnet gideon ehrlich writes  what are the borders the islamic world dreams about 

 the islamic world dreams of being the whole planet but not by kicking the current inhabitant out we rather deam of the day everybody converts

if jews had the same dream i would not feel threatened a bit

there certainly are muslims who do not believe that their dream of a global islamic community should be achieved through force

there are however others and they are often far more visiblevocal than the former who do accept the establishment of global islam through force

i would not feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing islamicization through peaceful means nor by jews advocating the same approach

those advocating force as a means of expanding their sides power are certainly a threat

to palestinians israel is doing just that maintaining its dominance of those outside its own group

if i am told that i am not one of you but you then impose your control on me damn right you are a threat

if i am a member of a nonmuslim minority inside the islamic world and actively did not accept my minority status i would also certainly see islams domination as having been acheived and maintained through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities within their ranks

 islamic readers i am waiting to your honest answer

 i want also a honest answer from zionists for the following questions i am not a zionist but do feel that both jewish and palestinian nationalist desires need at this juncture to be accepted in some way

 why do jews who dont even believe in god as is the case with many of the founders of secular zionism have a right in palestine more than the inhabitants of palestine just because god gave you the land

  for the same reason that some muslims believe it is proper and righteous for islam to be spread by force upon those who do not want that

why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of the inhabitants are not jews and do not want to be part of israel

i refer to the most you also refer to because they are scared and feel very threatened as well feeling that this area is to some degree part of their beliefreligionheritage identityetc

i too strongly object to those that justify israeli rule of those who do not want that

the occupied territories are not israels to control to keep or to dominate

 tim

your assistance would be greatly appreciated  gf try thr recradioshortwave newsgroup

 im not ignorant of the holocaust and know more  about nazi germany than most people maybe including you

you really belong to the  of ignorants in usa who dont know what the holocaust shoa should be the real word was

first you write in messageid aprvirginiaedu date sat  apr   gmt  i think the israeli press might be a tad bit biased in  reporting the events

i doubt the propaganda machine of goering  and later as somebody informed you about your gross mistake you write in messageid aprvirginiaedu date sun  apr   gmt  first let me correct myself in that it was goerbels and   not goering airforce who ran the nazi propaganda machine

instead of joseph goebbels

and you dare to say that you know more about nazi germany than most people maybe including us 

im sure you learned the history of nazi germany and austria from your family

 what i resent is ignorant statements that call people  names when they disagree with your position

opposing the  atrocities commited by the israeli governement hardly qualifies  as antisemitism

if you think name calling is a valid form of  argument in intellectual circles you need to get out more  often

trying to make comparisons between israels politics and nazi german austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance high intellect low humanity none and antisemitism average

i respect anybody who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a civilized manner

i would never say that anybody that critizises israel andor its politics is an antisemite except he uses antisemitic vocabularyterminologydemagogy

israel is not a perfect country and its politicians also commits errors even some of them are corrupt like politicians in any other country but they carry a huge burden to care for the safety of all its citizens and that is really not an easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect that israel commits the one big error and wipe the country and its jewish citizens plus the socalled collaborators arabs that wanted to live in peace with their jewish neighbours of the map

as i said israel is not a perfect country but it is the only democracy in the whole middleeast and the only country in the world where jews from everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries they are living

our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on nonjewish nations and its governments as soon as there are more or les big socialeconomicalpolitical problems in any country the first ones that pay for the broken glasses are the jews and later the other minorities of the country

 i dont think the suffering of some jews during wwii   justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government

any  attempt to call civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is  not appreciated

this is really outrageous  murdered jews besides the thousands who survived the shoa in some way or another and the rest of the living ones mourning for all of them 

i dont know what you call a civil libertarian never heard about them but i know only one thing if all of them think like you do it then civil libertarians is a new denomination for antisemites

may other civil libertarians come to word to this group so that we can learn if abeyer and me are right that civil libertarians are antisemites or that im wrong and he is missusing that word

from nstramersupergasdazixcoingrcom naftaly stramer subject the hamas way of death nntppostinghost supergas replyto nstramerdazixcoingrcom organization intergraph electronics lines  the hamas way of death following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the qassam battalions the military arm of hamas an islamic palestinian group

hamas figures significantly in the middle east equation

in december israel deported more than  palestinians to lebanon in response to hamass kidnapping and execution of an israeli soldier

a longer version appears in the may issue of harpers magazine which obtained and translated the tape

my name is yasir hammad alhassan ali

i live in nuseirat a refugee camp in the gaza strip

i was born in 

i finished high school then attended gaza polytechnic

later i went to work for islamic university in gaza as a clerk

im married and i have two daughters

the qassam battalions are the only group in palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad holy war

our primary concern is palestinians who collaborate with the enemy

many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the israeli security services

since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime

our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration

to do so we abduct collaborators intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure palestinians into collaboration in the first place

in addition to that naturally we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them

we dont execute every collaborator

after all about  percent of them are innocent victims tricked or blackmailed into their misdeeds

the decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes

if like many collaborators he has been recruited as an agent of the israeli border guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once

hes as dangerous as an israeli soldier so we treat him like an israeli soldier

theres another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role  the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators

i regard the isqat the process by which a palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator

if someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat than it is our religious duty to execute him

a third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics

they work on direct orders from the security services to distribute drugs as widely as possible

their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more

they collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave

the dealers must also be executed

in the battalions we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators we cant afford to abduct an innocent person because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever

we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established  never before

if after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt then he is executed

in many cases we dont have to make our evidence against collaborators public because everyone knows that theyre guilty

but when the public isnt aware that a certain individual is a collaborator and we accuse him people are bound to ask for evidence

many people will proclaim his innocence so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed

this proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession

at first every collaborator denies his crimes

so we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him

we tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people even in the last moment of his life by confessing and giving us the information we need

we say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim

that kind of talk is convincing

most of them confess after that

others hold out in those cases we apply pressure both psychological and physical

then the holdouts confess as well

only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation

in that case the collaborator had been seen working for the border guard since before the intifada and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend who disclosed the information to us

in addition three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat

with this much evidence there was no need to interrogate him

but we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions

in every case our principal is the same the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes

a few weeks ago we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation

an although we had hundreds of names still because of our fear of god and of hell we could not mark any of these men except for the one i just mentioned for execution

when we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun

but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we cant shoot him  to do so might give away our locations

thats why collaborators are strangled

sometimes we ask the collaborator what do you think

how should we execute you

one collaborator told us strangle me

he hated the sight of blood

xmailer tmail version r   in article apryumaacnscolostateedu bhlancecolostateedu writes      it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer   in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc   some young men usually aged between  to  years are members of   the lebanese resistance

even the inhabitants of the village do not   know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often   suspect who they are and what they are up to

these young men are   supported financially by iran most of the time

they sneak arms and   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps   for israeli patrols

every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured   by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

    this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups   to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the   opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or   in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search

certainly the   people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the   innocent civilians into harms way

    are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel   should totally back down

sothe easiest way to get away with attacking   another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects   innocent lives

  tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong

assuming that they are using  civilians for cover are they not killing soldiers in their country

if the  buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working

why is it  further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages

why not just  kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone

you see there is more to  the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back  getting even

it doesnt make sense to shell the villages

the least  it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of  civilians

please clarify your standards for rules of engagement

as i understand it israelis are at all times and under all circumstances fair targets

their opponents are legitimate targets only when mirandized or some such

im sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant apriori that israelis are the black hats and that therefore killing them is automatically a good thing go hezbollah

the corollary is that the hezbollah are the white hats and that whatever they do is a good thing and the israelis only prove themselves to be bad guys by attacking them

this sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan i know who cheers when one of the players on his team uses his stick to permanently rearrange an opponents face and curses the ref for penalizing his side

of course when its different when the roles are reversed

tamamidis the way you put it it is only the turks   who bear the responsibility of the things happening today

that is hard to   believe for somebody trying to be objective

  when it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot   blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides

  what were you doing on anatolia after the ww anyway

  do you think it was your right to be there

 ive heard many turks say this and it surpises me that they dont read about itremember the treaty of sevresas a consequence of being in the axis powers in wwithe turks under international law were supposed to look after their minorities ie

greeksarmenianskurdsi must say turkkurd relations are improving slightly with time and not pose a threat to turkeys neighbours

the turks blatantly rejected this treatythe germans grudgingly accepted versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the german peoplethe greeks who had an army therewere there with british and french backing to enforce sevres

in possibly the first example of appeasement the young turk government managed screwed the treaty of laussane out of the weak alliesthis was after the greek forces were were destroyed at smyrnawhen this occurred incidently french warships were in the harbour and many greeks trying escape swam to the french warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the french as they clawed theyre way up the sides of the ships

libertaeegalitaefraternatae

  there were a couple millions of greeks living in asia minor until 

 someone had to protect them

if not us who

   i am not saying that conflicts started with that

it is only   not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering

  it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise

  i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the   visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey

i thought it   was a positive attempt to make the relations better

   compromise on what the invasion of cyprus the involment of turkey in  greek politics the refusal of turkey to accept  miles of territorial  waters as stated by international law the properties of the greeks of  konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the greek lakesorry aegean

  there are some things on which there can not be a compromise

    the greeks i mentioned who wouldnt talk to me are educated   people

they have never met me but they know

i am bad person   because i am from turkey

politics is not my business and it is   not the business of most of the turks

when it comes to individuals   why the hatred

  any person who supports the policies of the turkish goverment directly or  indirecly is a bad person

 it is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the  actions of your goverment that make you bad

 people do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you  are

you are a supporter of the policies of the turkish goverment and  as a such you must pay the price

   so that makes me think that there is some kind of   brainwashing going on in greece

after all why would an educated person   treat every person from a nation the same way

can you tell me about your   history books and things you learn about greekturkish   encounters during your schooling

  take it easy

newsserviceuciedu tclockorionoacuciedu tim clock writes   assuming

also come on brad

if we are going to get anywhere in  this or any discussion it doesnt help to bring up elements i never  addressed nor commented on in any way

i made no comment on who is  right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover  and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas  they will be injured as both parties continue their fight

 pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three idf troops and then later know the exact number and whereabouts of all of them

several villages were shelled

how could the idf possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted villages

you see it was an arbitrary act of retaliation

 i will again repeat my statement  i do not condone these indiscriminate israeli acts nor have i ever  if the villagers do not know who these guerillas are which you stated earlier how do you expect the israelis to know

it is very difficult to identify who they are this is why the guerillas prefer to lose themselves in the general population by dressing the same acting the same etc   the host arab state did littlenothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with israel  the problem tim is that the original reason for the invasion was palestinian attacks on israel not lebanese attacks

 i agree but because lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these attacks from its territory should israel simply sit quietly and accept its situation

israel asked the lebanese government over and over to control this third party state within lebanese territory and the attacks kept occuring

at what point does israel or any state have the right to do something itself to stop such attacks

never

   while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars  have been removed the weapons needed to crossborder attacks still  remain to some extent

rocket attacks still continue and commando  raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard  for human life yours of that of others

such attacks also continue

 yes i am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify occupying your neighbors land

israel must resolve its disputes with the native palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks

 it is also the responsibility of any state to not allow any outside party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state

if  angola had the power and  south africa refused or couldnt stop antiangolan guerillas based on sa soil from attacking angola and  south africa refused to have un troops stationed on its territory between it and angola would angola be justified in entering sa

if not are you saying that angola had to accept the situation do nothing and absorb the attacks

  bat guano

the situation you call for existed in the s and attacks  were commonplace

 not true

lebanese were not attacking israel in the s with a strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference i believe that the border could be adequately patrolled

the palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed in past years and i do not see as significant a threat as once existed

 i refered above at all times to the palestinian attacks on israel from lebanese soil not to lebanese attacks on israel

one hopes that a lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its border but there is no reason to believe it will be any stronger

what has changed is that the plo was largely driven out of lebanon not by the lebanese not by syria and that is by far the most important making it easier to control future palestinian attacks from lebanese soil

that change was brought about by israeli action the plo would never have been ejected by lebanese arab state or un actions

 please tim dont fall into the trap of treating lebanese and palestinians as all part of the same group

there are too many who think all arabs or all muslims are the same

too many times i have seen people support the bombing of palestinian camps in retaliation for an idf death at the hands of the lebanese resistance or the shelling of lebanese villages in retaliation for a palestinian attack

 i fully recognize that the lebanese do not want to be used by either side and have been and continue to be

but the most fundamental issue is that if a state cannot control its borders and make real efforts to do so it should expect others to do it for them

hopefully that other will be the un but it is as we see in its cowardice regarding bosnia weak

  mossadqubeocunixonca   my opinions are not associated with anything including my head 

 in article shaigaprcomposerthinkcom shaigcomposerthinkcom shai guday writes   that is what is so hard of south lebanon israel is  not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines but a guerilla  tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with  the local populace

not because they are evil cowards that  use women and children as shields but because that is the only  way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army

while that is currently true from their perspective it is also worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer from attempts to control the guerillas

furthermore there were cases in the past of palestinian gun emplacements being situated within villages

the argument that can be made for small arms fire can not be made for field pieces

 hizbollah and amal are now the main two militias

though  hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance  operation and better motivated by religious conviction

as i recall amal was primarily nationalistically lebanon for the lebanese motivated

i think that the difference between them was also a matter of funding and support

one question does come to mind however given that you claim the hizbollah to be more committed etc and that their stated position is 

no peace talks



no peace talks









n no peace talks

n no israel if we assume that lebanon and syria are sincere in their desire for peace why hasnt the hizbollah been disarmed

 i hope you are right on israeli willingness to withdraw but i still  contend that withdrawal would be the better course for israels  security since it would reduce its military losses and i claim  that the lebanese and syrian govts would be able to prevent any  further attacks on northern israel

bearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable than civilian ones i am sure you can understand why israel is slow to act in that manner

  no the syrian govt is more than happy to have israel sink into another   lebanese morass

i could elaborate if necessary

  hmm

here we disagree on what serves syria interests better

 i think syria wants to have lebanon all to itself

it would  be willing to guarantee northern israels security in return for  israeli withdrawal

i dont think syria wants israel to be  involved in its protectorate of lebanon

syria is sitting at the  negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants  to get a political resolution

a renewal of hostilities  along the lebanese front could put the whole me peace negotiations  back in question

i agree that syria wants lebanon to be part of its greater syria

i dont necessarily see that the syrians would be unhappy to see israel up to its neck in another lebanese morass afterwhich syria could continue on its merry schedule when israeli public opinion would lead to a second pullout

 i agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable

new details of extensive adl spy operation emerge  inquiry transcripts reveal nearly  years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups by richard c paddock times staff writer

san francisco  to the outside world roy bullock was a smalltime art dealer who operated from his house in the castro district

in reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the antidefamation league for nearly  years

his code name at the prominent jewish organization was cal and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an arabamerican delegation that visited rep nancy pelosi dsan francisco in her washington dc office

for a time cal tapped into the phone message system of the white aryan resistance to learn of hate crimes

from police sources he obtained privileged personal information on at least  people

and he met surreptitiously with agents of the south african government to trade his knowledge for crisp new  bills

these are among the secrets that bullock and david gurvitz a former los angelesbased operative divulged in extensive interviews with police and the fbi in a growing scandal over the nationwide intelligence network operated by the antidefamation league

officials of the antidefamation league while denying any improper activity have said they will cooperate with the investigation

they have refused to discuss bullock and gurvitz

transcripts of the interviews  among nearly  pages of documents released by san francisco prosecutors last week  offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory

at times the intelligence activities took on a cloakanddagger air with laundered payments shredded documents hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like ironsides and flipper

on one occasion gurvitz recounts he received a tip that a propalestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for haifa israel

although the antidefamation league publicly denies any ties to israel gurvitz phoned an israeli consular official to warn him

shortly afterward another official called gurvitz back and debriefed him

the court papers also added to the mystery of tom gerard a former cia agent and san francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the antidefamation league

gerard fled to the philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the fbi but left behind a briefcase in his police locker

its contents included passports drivers licenses and identification cards in  different names identification cards in his own name for four american embassies in central america and a collection of blank birth certificates army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies

also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads a black hood apparently for use in interrogations and photos of blindfolded and chained men

investigators suspect that gerard and other police sources gave the adl confidential drivers license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people including as many as  members of one target group the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee

each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony san francisco police inspector ron roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant

the antidefamation league a selfdescribed jewish defense and civil rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are antisemitic extremist or racist

the adls factfinding division headed by irwinn suall in new york enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists

however evidence seized from bullocks computer shows he kept files on at least  groups of all political stripes including the american civil liberties union earth island institute the united farm workers jews for jesus mother jones magazine the center for investigative reporting the bo gritz for president committee the asian law caucus and the aids activist group act up

the computer files also included information on several members of congress including pelosi house armed services committee chairman ron dellums dberkeley and former republican rep pete mccloskey from the bay area

in their statements bullock and gurvitz said the antidefamation league has collected information on political activists in the los angeles area for more than  years

they said they worked closely with three los angeles county sheriffs deputies who specialized in intelligence work a los angeles police department antiterrorism expert and a san diego county sheriffs department intelligence officer

a spokesman for the los angeles sheriffs department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the adl

the los angeles police department which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation and the san diego sheriffs department declined comment

bullock  is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama

although he is not jewish he began working undercover as a volunteer for the adl and the fbi in indiana in  after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the communist party

bullock moved to los angeles in  and was given a paid position by the adl as an intelligence operative he told authorities

in the mids he moved to san francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the west coast

to keep his identity secret his salary has always been funneled through beverly hills attorney bruce i hochman  who has never missed a payment in more than  years bullock said

i was an investigator for the adl

i investigated any and all antidemocratic movements bullock said







officially im only a contract worker with bruce hochman

that way the league would not be officially connected with me

bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from communists to arabamerican to gay radicals to skinheads usually using his own name but once adopting the alias elmer fink

im one of a kind he told police

in recent years however his adl affiliation has increasingly become known and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him

in the mids he helped san francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist cory phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police

in part because of this investigation he became close friends with gerard who at the time was working in the san francisco police intelligence division

bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups

an fbi report noted how he investigated one palestinian group bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash and would share the reports with gerard

bullock also gave the trash to gerard for gerard to examine

gerard would later return the trash to bullock

from a wide range of sources bullock compiled files on  individuals and more than  political groups

gerard whose files contained many identical entries kept files on  people

in  bullock and gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the south african government

bullock tells of meetings secretly with south african agents at san francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new  bills

bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources

once he rewrote an innocuous item published by san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen about south african bishop desmond tutu and the wife of prominent attorney melvin belli  and submitted it as his own work

bullock said it was gerard who sold official police intelligence

bullock said he split about  from the south african government evenly with gerard telling him at one point i may be gay but im a straight arrow

in his interviews with the police and fbi bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law

for example bullock admitted to receiving drivers license records and criminal histories from gerard on about  people  a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer

and he said gerard gave him complete san francisco police department intelligence files on various nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy

bullock said he also received a confidential fbi report on the nation of islam that he later shredded at the antidefamation leagues san francisco office

bullock seemed proud of his operation eavesdrop in which he used a paid informant codenamed scumbag to help tap into a white aryan resistance phone message network listening to the messages left by members of the rightwing group

for a short time it was wonderful he told police

in los angeles adl operative gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a factfinder to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups

among other things he told san francisco authorities the los angeles adl office kept a record of any arabamerican who had antiisrael leanings or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment

gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the adl intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job gurvitz wanted at the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies

gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a jewish spy to a rightwing hate group

gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the fbi in the probe providing considerable information about the adl operation

unlike bullock he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation

gurvitz declined through his father in los angeles to be interviewed by the times

bullocks attorney said his client would not comment

million muslim women children and elderly people of eastern anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the ottoman empire between 

it is unfortunately a truth that armenians are known as collaborators of the nazis during world war ii and that even today criminalnazi members of the asalasdpaarf terrorism triangle preach and instigate racism hatred violence and terrorism among peoples

and xsoviet armenia continues its antiturkish policy in the following ways 

xsoviet armenia denies the historical fact of the turkish genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility



xsoviet armenia employing asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle and criminalnazi armenians attempts to call into question the veracity of the turkish genocide



xsoviet armenia has also implemented statesponsored terrorism through the asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle in an attempt to silence the turkish peoples vehement demands and protests



using all its human financial and governmental resources xsoviet armenia and its tools in the united states attempt to silence through terrorism bribery and other subversive methods nonturkish supporters of the turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian

using all the aforementioned methods the xsoviet armenian government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the turkish case a contemporary issue

yet despite the efforts of the xsoviet armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the armenians the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the turkish genocide

from bcclevelandfreenetedu mark ira kaufman subject center for antiisrael propaganda organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost thorinscwruedu the center for policy research writes  from the israeli press  hadashot  march   the israeli police department announced on the evening of friday march  that it is calling upon jewish israeli citizens with gun permits to carry them at all times so as to contribute to their security and that of their surroundings

considering all the murders of innocent israelis at the hands of arab death merchants i see nothing wrong with the advice

haaretz  march   yehoshua matza likud chair of the knesset interior committee stated that he intends to demand that the police department make it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills nonjewish terrorists will not be put on trial

as usual the bias of the center for policy research echoes through this newsgroup

here we have an enraged likudnik who is venting his spleen and you portray it as if this is going to become policy

you dont say what the response to matzas suggestion was

do do not mention whether he was refering to terrorists caught in the act which could be a clear cut case of selfdefence

would you care to elaborate on this or was this all you wanted to say on the matter

why dont you give up this center for policy research crap and just post your biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name

haaretz  march  today a private security firm and units from the idf southern command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the gaza strip as an additional stage in the upgrading of security measures in the strip

 the gates will aid in the searching of nonjewish gaza residents as they leave for work in israel

they can be used to reveal the presence of knives axes weapons and other sharp objects

 in addition to the gates which will be operated by a private civilian company large quantities of magneticcard reading devices are being brought to the inspection points to facilitate the reading of the magnetic cards these nonjewish workers must carry

a laudable precaution

every single thing you post about israel is posted to portray israel as negatively as you can

deliberate omissions are an integral part of the shtick

and its not only the incidents that you do not mention but even the stories you do post are fraught with omissions which change the entire meaning

the absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias

in your effort to portray israel in an unfavorable light you have accomplished nothing except to prove that a respectable sounding label like the center for policy research is nothing but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude against israel and the need to vent it

this center for policy research stuff is nonsense

from pgfcunixacccolumbiaedu peter garfiel freeman subject hamas methods of murder nntppostinghost cunixacccolumbiaedu organization columbia university lines  if anyone gets the new york times the edit page has a transcript of a vhs from hams describing their methods of torture and execution

i will post it later on

 turkey must bare its teeth to armenia

sooner than you expect

remember cyprus

 i have to say i vehemently disagree with you i have seen too bad

in fact by  nazi armenians in europe had established a vast network of progerman collaborators that extended over two continents

thousands of armenians were serving the german army and waffenss in russia and western europe

armenians were involved in espionage and fifthcolumn activities for hitler in the balkans and arabian peninsula

they were promised an independent state under german protection in an agreement signed by the armenian national council

a copy of this agreement can be found in the congressional record november   see document 

on this side of the atlantic nazi armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance

they had often expressed pronazi sentiments until america entered the war

in summary during world war ii armenians were carried away with the german might and cringing and fawning over the nazis

in that zeal the armenian publication in germany hairenik carried statements as follows sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements the jews when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease and when it becomes necessary for a people the nazis to eradicate them in an uncommon method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary

during the surgical operation the flow of blood is a natural thing

now for a brief view of the armenian genocide of the muslims and jews  extracts from a letter dated december   published in the san francisco chronicle as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one b amarian

we have first hand information and evidence of armenian atrocities against our people jewsmembers of our family witnessed the murder of  members of our family near erzurum turkey by armenian neighbors bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely jewish andor muslim

armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors armenians were in league with hitler in the last war on his premise to grant them self government if in return the armenians would help exterminate jewsarmenians were also hearty proponents of the antisemitic acts in league with the russian communists

paper zman tel aviv tel avivs time

friday local tel avivs paper affiliated with maariv

date  february  journalist guy ehrlich subject interview with soldiers who served in the duvdevan cherry units which disguise themselves as arabs and operate within the occupied territories

excerpts from the article a lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods

but the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with

it is that everyone who serves in the cherry after a time goes in one way or another insane

a man who said this who will here be called danny his full name is known to the editors served in the cherry

after his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy

his pal who will here be called dudu was also serving in the cherry and is now about to depart for a roundtheworld tour

they both look no different from average israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service

but in their souls one can notice something completely differentit was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them

and they think that to most of their fellows from the cherry it woundnt be easy either

yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking

the following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness

 a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry

we called such soldiers hi

hit by the intifada

under my command was a soldier who talked to himself nonstop which is a common phenomenon in the cherry

i sent him to a psychiatrist

but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane 

on fridays when i come home my parents know i cannot be talked to until i go to the beach surf a little calm down and return

the keys of my fathers car must be ready for in advance so that i can go there

i they dare talk to me before or whenever i dont want them to talk to me i just grab a chair and smash it instantly

i know it is my nerve smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the beach

only there i become normal  another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother

it was an omelette of sorts

she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me

i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind

i told her how i shot an arab and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it

she began to laugh hysterically

i wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead 

so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails

he shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they deserved

one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the arab was burning all over just beautifully

i was delighted to see it

my pal fired three bullets two at the arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum

it hit him straight in his ass

we both felt that wed pulled off something

next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look

i reached the spot first

and then that arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me

i yelled shut up and he dared talk back to me in hebrew

so i just laughed straight in his face

i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes

then i told him all right wait a moment

i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab

i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that

i keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face

this infuriated me

i got very angry because i felt i was becoming mad

so i stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head

only then she stopped laughing

at first she didnt know what to say



but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently

i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field

a gull appeared right in the middle of the field

my friend shot it at once

then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us

my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it

we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock

we shot down two deer more and went to take a look

when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother

we carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit

we were just delighted by that sight

we had hitem so good 

then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering

i approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance

when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in

but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us

this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness

standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey

we couldnt explain what had happened to us

we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly

 we always go back to places we carried out assignments in

this is why we can see them

when you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got power

you feel godlike of sorts



both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting

dudu is not willing to work in any securitylinked occupation

danny feels the exact opposite

why shouldnt i take advantage of the skills i have mastered so well 

why shouldnt i earn 

for each chopped head i would deliver while being a mercenary in south africa 

this kind of job suits me perfectly

i have no human emotions any more

if i get a reasonable salary i will have no problem to board a plane to bosnia in order to fight there

how dare you presume that he even has a right to go around a newsgroup with a desire to convince others of any external position he has

they are news because they are the exceptions

and the islamic holocaust is much the topic of the day

the historical evidence proves that during the period of  to  the armenian government ordered incited assisted and participated in the genocide of 

million muslim people because of race religion and national origin

armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage destroyed telephone cables blew up bridges blocked passes set up ambushes attacked security stations and small turkish outposts behind the ottoman army lines on the one hand and on the other ruthlessly attacked turkish and kurdish villages slaughtering the turkish population indiscriminately women children old and young alike

innocent muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death or massacred with axes and swords or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below

widespread armenian massacres of innocent muslims took place in regions of van kars sivas erzurum bitlis erzincan mus diyarbakir and maras

the ottoman army while fighting to prevent the russian invasion also had to deal with armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind

the armenian genocide of the muslims spread to all parts of eastern anatolia

starting from late  armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in eastern anatolia because the arena was left to the armenians

almost every turkish town and village from erzincan up to azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by armenians and the turkish genocide has been documented by armenian russian american british ottoman german austrian and french journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the bloodthirsty armenian genocide squads

the ottoman army liberating trabzon bayburt erzincan erzurum kars and other regions from the russians saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt people slaughtered massacred

the massacres conducted by armenians which became a black stain for humanity shocked and disgusted even the russian british german austrian french and american authorities

almost every ottoman document is related to armenian massacres and cruelties

the inhuman treatment cruelties atrocities genocide by armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent moslem turkish and kurdish people are sufficiently reflected in historical documents

even today over seventyfive years later the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard

i have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of russians and armenians from turkish territories through armenia

although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of armenian gangs i have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the armenians at almost every step

all the villages from trabzon to erzincan and from erzincan to erzurum are destroyed

corpses of turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere

according to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains the first horrible and fearful events begun when the russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by armenian gangs

the russians usually treated the people well but the people feared the intervention of the armenians

once these places had been taken over by the armenians however the massacres begun

they clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the armenian and kurdish land from the turks and thus solve the nationality problem

today i had the opportunity to meet austrian and german soldiers who had escaped from russian prison camps and come from kars and alexander paul gumruleninakanrussian officers tried to save the turks and there were clashes between russian officers and armenian gangs

i am now in erzurum and what i see is terrible

almost the whole city is destroyed

the smell of the corpses still fills the air

although there are speculations that armenian gangs murdered austrian and german prisoners as well i could not get the supporting evidence in this regard but there is proof of murdering of turkish prisoners of war

the problem if transffering us government files about yigal arens and some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal or a local american law seemed to belong to some local american law forum not to this forum

the readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents of those files

so it will be nice if yigal will tell us 

why do american authorities consider yigal arens to be dangerous



why does the adl have an interest in that person

the islamic world dreams of being the whole planet but not by kicking the current inhabitant out we rather deam of the day everybody converts

if jews had the same dream i would not feel threatened a bit

so i should be very comfortable that  people want to convert me to islam

or to convert me to anything

there are many types of violence physical murder is only one

trying to convert is an insult

its like trying to tell me that me andor my godmy lack of god are just crap that i need a new converted one

this does not apply for muslims only of course

same for jews and for some friendly nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches and cheap booklets about some church  and when the objective is i think however that you are wrong to convert everybody its just a matter of time when violence will occur

arent we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of conversion related violence 

why not let the other more inferiour people live as they wish and take care your business

you do assume that they are inferiour or their beliefs are as long as you want to change their thinking

source edward k boghosian radical group hosts wellattended solidarity meeting the armenian reporter may   pp

 

athens greece  an array of representatives of greek political parties including the ruling pasok party and a host of political groups both armenian and nonarmenian joined to voice their solidarity with the armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new armenian political force were voiced here on sunday april  during the nd international meeting of solidarity with the armenian people

and judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations at least here in greece the armenian cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world

the international meeting of solidarity was sponsored by the greek branch of the armenian popular movement a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of armenians who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia asala

the organization has branches in various european and middle eastern countries and the united states although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of asala

voicing the support of pasok the ruling party in greece to the armenian people was mr charalambidi michalis a member of the central committee of the party and the greek member of the permanent peoples tribunal

explaining the goals and aspirations of the armenian popular movement was ara sarkisian

significant was the address delivered by mr bassam abusalim on behalf of the popular front for the movements continued support of the armenians armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause pledging that palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to armenian youth who need training for such a struggle

later mr abusalim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that his organization had always trained armenian members of asala and that this policy will continue

the doors of our camps are always open to armenian freedom fighters he affirmed

among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of prime minister papandreou who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering representatives of the christian democratic party edik center party two wings of the communist party representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations a number of mayors of greek towns and cities two greek members of the european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference

also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of bulgaria in athens

more than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers including the following palestinian national revolutionary movement fatah popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command the central committee of the palestinian national liberation movementfatah the socialist progressive party of lebanon arab socialist labor party the kurdistan democratic union of iraq and numerous other international groups all noted for their radical stand in the israeli palestinian conflict

support from arfrm among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary federationrevolutionary movement the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers

the message clearly gave its support to the armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will continue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are to expose the antiarmenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag bureau

the message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement open supporters of asala and armed struggle

the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the greek capital known as neos kosmos where there is a large armenian presence

the headquarters are located in a twostory building which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of armenian youth who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves now any comment

 well it seems your book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the ncrap posted by mr 

o boy

please can you tell us why those quotes are crapbecause you do not like them

because they really existwhy

as i said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic  you couldnt reject it  in addition the authors preface was written on january   but the book was published in 

here we go again

in the book i have both the front page and the authors preface give the same year  and  january  respectively

anyone can check it at herhis libraryif not i can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct i really dont care what year it was first published or  what i care about is what the book writes about murders torturesetin the given quotes by serdar argic and your denial of these quotesand your groundless accussations etc

   dd i can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim

 vd what is new

 i will post a gif file but i am not going go through the effort to show there is some turkish modified republication of the book like last time

i claim i have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in serdar argics reference hasyou couldnt reject itbut now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around

lets see how you liefrom nonexisting quotes to republication first you said there was no such a quote in the given referenceyou called serdar argic a liar

i said to you no mrdavidian there exactly existed such a quote

i even gave the call number page numbersyou couldt reject it

and now you are lying again and talking about modifiedrepublished book without any proof how when where by whom etc by the way how is it possible to republish the book in  if it was first published in your claimi am sure that you have some pretty well suited theories as usual and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and mrdavidians liesi also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are 

r  and the page numbers to verify the quotes and   it is not possible that s text has  pages mine has  and yours has 

now are you claiming that there cant be such a reference by saying it is not possible

if not what is your point

differences in the number of pages

mine was published in serdar argics was in  no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publicationsetc etc does it give you an idea

the issue was not the number of pages the book hasor the year first published and you tried to hide the whole point the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed torturedetc by armeniansand those quotes given by serdar argic exist

it was the issue wasntit

you were not able to object itdoes it bother you anyway

you name all these tortures and murders by armenians as a crap people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still has so many craps in the

what about cyprus

the majority of the population is christian but your fellow turkish friends did and still doing a good job for you by cleaning the area from christians

all your article reflects is your abundant ignorance

the people of turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece someday whatever the cost to the parties involved

the history speaks for itself

greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on july   in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of archibishop makarios

following the greek cypriot attempt to annex the island to greece with the aid of the greek army turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements

turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island turkish cypriots

for those turkish cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 

the release of nikos sampson a member of eoka national organization of cypriot fighters and a convicted terrorist shows that the enosis mentality continues to survive in greece

one should not forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks in cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to destroy the islands independence by annexing it to greece

of course the greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct

the museum of barbarism  irfan bey street kumsal area nicosia cyprus it is the house of dr nihat ilhan a major who was serving at the cyprus turkish army contingent

during the attacks launched against the turks by the greeks on th december  dr nihat ilhans wife and three children were ruthlessly and brutally killed in the bathroom where they had tried to hide by savage greeks

dr nihat ilhan happened to be on duty that night the th december 

pictures reflecting greek atrocities committed during and after  are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum

an eyewitness account of how a turkish family was butchered by greek terrorists the date is the th of december 

the onslaught of the greeks against the turks which started three days ago has been going on with all its ferocity and defenseless women old men and children are being brutally killed by greeks

and now kumsal area of nicosia witnesses the worst example of the greeks savage bloodshed

the wife and the three infant children of dr nihat ilhan a major on duty at the camp of the cyprus turkish army contingent are mercilessly and dastardly shot dead while hiding in the bathroom of their house by maddened greeks who broke into their home

a glaring example of greek barbarism

let us now listen to the relating of the said incident told by mr hasan yusuf gudum an eye witness who himself was wounded during the same terrible event

on the night of the th of december  my wife feride hasan and i were paying a visit to the family of major dr nihat ilhan

our neighbours mrs ayshe of mora her daughter ishin and mrs ayshes sister novber were also with us

we were all sitting having supper

all of a sudden bullets from the pedieos river direction started to riddle the house sounding like heavy rain

thinking that the diningroom where we were sitting was dangerous we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought would be safer

altogether we were nine persons

we all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet

we waited in fear

mrs ilhan the wife of major doctor was standing in the bath with her three children murat kutsi and hakan in her arms

suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open

greeks had come in and were combing every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets

during these moments i heard voices saying in greek you want taksim eh

and then bullets started flying in the bathroom

mrs ilhan and her three children fell into the bath

they were shot

at this moment the greeks who broke into the bathroom emptied their guns on us again

i heard one of the majors children moan then i fainted

when i came to myself  or  hours later i saw mrs ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath

i and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded

but what had happened to my wife

then i remembered and immediately ran to the toilet where in the doorway i saw her body

she was brutally murdered

in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying help help

is there no one to save us

i became terrified

i thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not dead they would kill me

so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the doublebed

an our passed by

in the distance i could still hear shots

my mouth was dry so i came out from under the bed and drank some water

then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago

there i offered sweets to mrs ayshe her daughter and mrs novber who were all wounded

we waited in the bathroom until  oclock in the morning

i thought morning would never come

we were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital

finally as we could walk mrs novber and i went out into the street hoping to find help and walked as far as koshklu chiftlik

there we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on

when i regained my consciousness i said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs ayshe and her daughter

after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to ankara for further treatment

there i have had four months treatment but still i cannot use my arm

on my return to cyprus greeks arrested me at the airport

all i have related to you above i told the greeks during my detention

they then released me

on foot into cypruss devastated turkish quarter we went tonight into the sealedoff turkish quarter of nicosia in which  to  people have been slaughtered in the last five days

we were the first western reporters there and we saw some terrible sights

in the kumsal quarter at no

 irfan bey sokagi we made our way into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass

a childs bicycle lay in a corner

in the bathroom looking like a group of waxworks were three children piled on top of their murdered mother

in a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the head

this we were told was the home of a turkish army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence

today was five days later and still they lay there

rene maccoll and daniel mcgeachie from the daily express i saw in a bathroom the bodies of a mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a turkish officer max clos le figaro  january  peter moorhead reporting from the village of skyloura cyprus

discussions start in london in cyprus terror continues

right now we are witnessing the exodus of turks from the villages

thousands of people abandoning homes land herds greek cypriot terrorism is relentless

this time the rhetoric of the hellenes and the bust of plato do not suffice to cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors

article by giorgo bocca correspondent of il giorno date  january  daily herald london an appalling sight and when i came across the turkish homes they were an appalling sight

apart from the walls they just did not exist

i doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation

i counted  blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes

each house had been deliberately fired by petrol

under red tile roofs which had caved in i found a twisted mass of bed springs childrens conts and cribs and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs tables and wardrobes

in the neighbouring village of ayios vassilios a mile away i counted  wrecked and burned out homes

they were all turkish cypriot homes

from this village more than  turkish cypriots had also vanishedin neither village did i find a scrap of damage to any greek cypriot house

newspaper maariv date 

december  author avi raz subject torture title of article moderate physical pressure several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation room in tulkarm prison during which he says he was humiliated beaten and tortured omar daoud jaber heard his interrogator a shabak agent captain louis chatting on the phone with his wife

at those moments omar said i felt that he was like a humanbeing but right after he finished talking he would be beat me and say you listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself and i understood that he was not really a human being

in late october  after  days in detention at tulkarm prison omar jaber was released without charges

among the jews as among the arabs there are good people and bad people he said after his release but there in tulkarm in the interrogations rooms you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being

although he left the detention installation in tulkarm bruised and humiliated i sat at home for ten days

my hands shook from nerves one may consider omar jaber lucky he got out not so healthy but entire and even ultimately returned to normal functioning at the small solar heater plant he owns

in contrast hassan bader alzbeidi for example was released seven weeks ago from detention in tulkarm after  days in the shabak wing cut off from his surroundings

he doesnt speak or react

mustafa barakat aged only  who was arrested in early august and was brought to the tulkarm detention installation left it one day later  dead

we have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the tulkarm detention installation by shabak interrogators noted dr niv gordon director of the association of israel and palestinian physicians for human rights



the right to complain against the shabak does not excite anan saber makhlouf a  year old student

in fact he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in tulkarm prison in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment

follow description of tortures omar a tall bearded man was silent

i do not want to talk about it he finally said quietly

some time later embarrased and ashamed he spoke sometimes he beats you and beats you until youll kiss his hand and not only his hand

even the hands of another interrogator and another whom he calls into the room and the last interrogator says now you are kissing my hand and later if i want you will kiss my ass

these things take place in an israeli army detention installation located within the military government compound in tulkarm west bank

but the shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom

in early march the idf allowed representatives of btselem the israeli information center for human rights in the territories to visit tulkarm prison but denied them access to the interrogation wing

the interrogation wing is shabak property being solely under shabak responsibility

all interrogations are performed by it said lieutnant sharon shoan the commander of the installation according to the internal report written by btselem member yuval ginbar following the visit

major david peer governing commander of the prison system in the central command was quoted in the report there is an ethical problem here  no one can enter the interrogation wing

questions to israelis   to shaigthinkcom  subject ten questions to israelis  dear shai  your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory

so why dont ypu sue him

naftaly stramer  intergraph electronics internet nstramerdazixcoingrcom   lookout road suite a voice  fax   boulder co  quality is everybodys job and its everybodys job to watch all that they can

 first of all it is called istanbul

 let me even spell it for you i s t a n b u l            secondly the turks are also asking for their money for  their destroyed and confiscated properties in greece and  formeryugoslavia bosnia and serbia

classic 

it is called the justice

we also demand that the xsoviet armenian government admit its responsibility for the turkish and kurdish genocide render reparations to the muslim people and return the land to its rightful owners

the recognition of the genocide has become an issue which cannot be delayed further and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed

now if were talking about rent and vandalism lets make it fair then greece pays back its dues and turkey pays for  years rent and destruction of classical architecture

deal

democracy in action

are you the truelove or falselove of arromdian of the asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle

if turks had behaved like christians to use force to convert to islam the nations which they brought under their power to which no one could have opposed today there would be no eastern problem

but turks did not do so

they obeyed the word of the koran to permit everybody to worship in their own way centuries before frederick the great pronounced his famous dictum

thus in an age when the christian europe itself shed christian blood and when people in europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs the ottoman empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made

and the barbarian 

turkey was the only country where the jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the christians could find asylum

these facts demonstrate that muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than christian countries

 the turks who are a conquering nation did not turkify the nations that came under their rule instead they respected their religions and traditions

it was a stroke of luck for romania to live under turkish rule instead of russian or austrian rule

because otherwise there would not have been a romanian nation today popescu ciocanel

turks rule over people under their administration only externally without interfering with their internal structures

on account of this the autonomy of minorities in turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced european countries

 human beings hate each other on account of religious differences

this flaw is older than islam and christianity

but there has never been any examples of this adjuration in turkey because turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion

if enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too or if it did not keep translating itself into action many nations in our europe would probably have considered themselves happy

a de mortraye

 turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition

on the contrary it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of christian fanaticism

if you look into history you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of christians especially that of the orthodoxes

no jew is able to appear in public during easter celebrations in athens even today

in turkey however if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities local courts immediately take them under their protection

in that vast and calm country of the sultan all religions and nations are living together peacefully

although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue it does not replace them

because of this the catholic sect is more free in istanbul and smyrna compared with paris and lyon

in addition to the fact that no law in turkey prohibits the openair ceremonies of this sect neither does any law imprison its cross in the church

while the dead are being taken to the graves a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant catholic hymns

when all the priests in all the churches in the galata and beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the eucharist celebrations chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the turks to stand in respect around the group of priests

 in article aprdasharvardedu adamendoruucp adam shostack writes in article aprvmmcgillca bha bhamusicbmcgillca writes  is israels occupation of southern lebanon temporary

 israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave lebanon when the lebanese government can provide guarantees that israel will not be attacked from lebanese soil and when the syrians leave

not acceptable

syria and lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the french invasion where they were both part of the same mandate territory  read colony

and lebanon has a right to make this decision without syrian troops controlling the country

until syria leaves and free elections take place its is rediculous to claim that the lebanese would even be involved in determining what happens to their country

israel has no right to determine what happens in lebanon

invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started

i expect you will agree that the same holds true for syria having no right to be in lebanon

 israel has already annexed areas taken over in the  war

these areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no legitamate governing body

citizenship was given to those residents in annexed areas who wanted citizenship

the un defines them as occupied

they are recognised as such by every nation on earth excluding one small caribean island

the un also thought zionism is racism

that fails to make it true

 the first reason was security

a large jewish presense makes it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate

a jewish settlements also act as fortresses in times of war

 theyu also are a liability

we are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks they lasted weeks against tanks in  and stopped those tanks from advancing

they also lasted days in 

there is little evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities

they evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take place over the jordan river the existance of large patrolled kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area where they are usually picked up in the morning

 a second reason was political

creating settlements brought the arabs to the negotiation table

had the creation of new towns and cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in israel where there was an arab majority

there would have been no land left that could be called arab

dont fool yourself

it was the gulf war that brought the israelis to the negotiating table

once their us backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else

nonsense

israel has been trying to get its neighbors to the negotiating table for  years

it was the gulf war that brought the arabs to the table not the israelis

 the point is there are many reasons people moved over the green line and many reasons the government wanted them to

whatever status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all or nothing deal

new boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not be the results of a war

unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of  there will be no peace

araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else

nonsense

according to arafat israel must be destroyed

he has never come clean and denied that this is his plan

he always waffles on what he means

when the arabs set off their volcano there will only be arabs in this part of the world

our people will continue to fuel the torch of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the occupied homeland is liberated  yasser arafat ap  adam shostack adamdasharvardedu if we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure wouldnt waste them on members of congress john perry barlow

 it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between  to  years are members of the lebanese resistance

even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to

these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time

they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols

every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search

certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harms way

are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down

sothe easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives

if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers

your damn right israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer zone

its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of arab states and watched as the states did nothing

it is not exactly surprizing that israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves

if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land

what

so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again

while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil

they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards antiisrael guerillas inresidence

 i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled

good lord brad

what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop anything

they are only stationed in a country because that country allows them in

it can ask them to leave at any time as nasser did in  and 

somehow with that limitation on the troops powers i dont think that israel is going to be any more comfortable

without a genuine commitment to peace from the arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon guarantees by other parties the un is worthless to israel but perhaps useful as a ruse

this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed

in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in

perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate

ifhowever you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups

if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the socalled security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks

such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israels public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions

along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it

from israels perspective concessions gets it nothingexcept the realization that it has given something up and now can only hope that the other side decides to do likewise

words can be taken back by merely doing so to take back tangible items land control of land requires the sort of action you say israel should stay away from

israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon

the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above  israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state involved  that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts committed by private groups  israel would prepare for the next round of attacks

what would israel want to return to those days and dont be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of presentday arab states

there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances  ah okwhat is different about the present situation that tells us that the arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic policies towards israel

now dont talk about vague political factors but about those tangible just like that which israel gave up factors that guarantee the responsibility of those states

your assessment of difference here is based on a whole lot of assumptions and most states dont feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing

and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon

 basil it has not

without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred

once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control

if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel

 tim your view of this entire matter is far too serenely onesided and selectively naive

in article aprcoloradoedu perlmanqsocoloradoedu eric s perlman writes perhaps though one can argue about whether or not the current palestinian delegation represents the plo i would hope it does not as the plo really doesnt have that kind of legitimacy

does it matter to you naftaly adam and others that arafat advises the delegation and that the plo overall supports it

does it also matter that arafat on behalf of the plo recognizes israel and its right to exist

further does israels new policy concerning direct negotiations with the plo hold any substance to the situation as a whole

no he does not

arafat explicitly denies this claim

from a libyan televison interview with yasser arafat  q some people say that the palestinian revolution has many times changed its strategies and tactics something which has left its imprint on the palestinian problem and on the palestinian liberation front

the strategies and tactics have not been clear

the question is is the direction of the palestinian problem clear

the palestinian leadership has stopped or at least this is what has been said in the media this happened on the way to the dialogue with the united states the plo recognized something called israel a no no no

we do not recognize the state of israel

we said recognition  when a palestinian state is established

it will then decide if to recognize israel or not

when it is established its parliament will convene and decide

policies which it can justify through occupation

because of this you have the grassroot movements that reject israels authority and disregard for human rights and if israel was serious about peace it would abandon these policies

and replace them with what

if israel is to withdraw its control of any territory there must be two prerequsites

one is that it leads to a reduction in deaths

the second is that it should not weaken israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks

leaving gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages arabs to think they can get what they want by killing jews

the only way israel should pull out of gaza is at the end of negotiations

these negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with security guarantees for both sides

until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again they should not expect or recieve more concessions

million turks perished of butchery at the hands of armenians

the genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the russian armenia

they were persecuted banished and slaughtered while much of ottoman army was engaged in world war i

the genocide treaty defines genocide as acting with a specific intent to destroy in whole or in substantial part a national ethnic racial or religious group

history shows that the xsoviet armenian government intended to eradicate the muslim population



million turks and kurds were exterminated by the armenians

international diplomats in ottoman empire at the time  including us

ambassador bristol  denounced the xsoviet armenian governments policy as a massacre of the kurds turks and tartars

the bloodthirsty leaders of the xsoviet armenian government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the muslims

the turkish genocide museums in turkiye honor those who died during the turkish massacres perpetrated by the armenians

the eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established beyond any doubt that the massacres against the muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated

the aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all turks in xsoviet armenian territories

the muslims of van bitlis mus erzurum and erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed

the massacres in trabzon tercan yozgat and adana were organized and perpetrated by the bloodthirsty leaders of the xsoviet armenian government

those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated

when the russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act

did you ever read newspaper at all

painful search 

the gruesome extent of februarys killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan  about  men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the fouryear war over nagorny karabakh

the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press

diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates

the  february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their fouryear campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday

the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians

the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku

later it was blurred by armenian denials and griefstricken azerbaijans wild and contradictory allegations of up to  dead

the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster said his figure of  people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings

a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali

an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may   dead people named and more than  bodies reported unidentified

this figure of nearly  dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence

francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of  bodies received at his mosque from hojali most of them civilians

we did not count the bodies

but the figure seems reasonable

it is no fantasy mr zen ruffinen said

we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead

mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre

dont get worked up

it will take several months to get a final figure the yearold lawyer said at his small office

mr rasulov knows about these things

it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that  people were killed and  wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january 

those nationalists the popular front finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about  miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians

officially  people have so far been certified as dead being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republics forensic department

this is just a small percentage of the dead said rafiq youssifov the republics chief forensic scientist

they were the only bodies brought to us

remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within  hours

of these  people  were women and  were children under  years old

gunshots killed  people shrapnel killed  and axes or blunt instruments killed 

exposure in the highland snows killed the last three

thirtythree people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifovs report

those  bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed mr rasulov said

files from mr rasulovs investigative commission are still disorganised  lists of  azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of  corpses brought to be washed in just one day

the most heartbreaking account from  witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on  february

there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly  in hojali  people by the stream and the road and  visible around nakhchivanik village mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot

people waved up to us for help

we saw three dead children and one twoyearold alive by one dead woman

the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up

we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return

there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time  many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces

the independent london  heroes who fought on amid the bodies aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafebar on the caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of hojali just over three months ago writes hugh pope

im still wearing the same clothes i dont have any others the yearold carpenter said beginning his account of the hojali disaster

i was wounded in five places but i am lucky to be alive

mr sadikov and his wife were short of food without electricity for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for  days

they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the  to  people left in the straggling azeri town on the edge of karabakh

at about pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before eight or nine kinds of weapons artillery heavy machineguns the lot mr sadikov said

soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack

some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town down a hill through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side

to escape the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about  miles away

they thought they were going to make it until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak

none of my group was hurt up to then  then we were spotted by a car on the road and the armenian outposts started opening fire mr sadikov said

azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians but their efforts were mostly in vain

mr sadikov said only  people from his group of  made it through including his wife and militiaman son

seven of his immediate relations died including his yearold elder brother

i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes

we have never got any of the bodies back

the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire

one hero of the evacuation alif hajief was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third groups crossing mr sadikov said

another hero elman memmedov the mayor of hojali said he and several others spent the whole day of  february in the bushy hillside surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay

as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee

the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian rocket attack

some people just kept going mr sadikov said

i had to get to the hospital for treatment

i was in a bad way

they even found a bullet in my sock

victims of war an azeri woman mourns her son killed in the hojali massacre in february left

nurses struggle in primitive conditions centre to save a wounded man in a makeshift operating theatre set up in a train carriage

griefstricken relatives in the town of agdam right weep over the coffin of another of the massacre victims

calculating the final death toll has been complicated because muslims bury their dead within  hours

 in article aprkpccom henrikquaylekpccom writes  in article apreerochesteredu terziogleerochesteredu esin terzioglu writes    cancellum       henrik let me clearify mr turkish henrik armenia is not getting itchy

she is simply letting the world know henrik that she will no longer sit there quiet and let turks get away with henrik their famous tricks

armenians do remember of the turkish invasion henrik of the greek island of cypress while the world simply watched

onur yalcin it is more appropriate to address netters with their names as onur yalcin they appear in their signatures i failed to do so since you did onur yalcin not bother to sign your posting

not only because it is the onur yalcin polite thing to do but also to avoid addressing ladies with onur yalcin mr as you have done

fine

please accept my opology 

onur yalcin secondly the island of which the name is more correctly spelled onur yalcin as cyprus has never been greek but rather it has been home to onur yalcin a bicommunal society formed of greeks and turks

it seems that  onur yalcin you know as little about the history and the demography of the onur yalcin island as you know about the essence of turkeys onur yalcin military intervention to it under international agreements

bicommunal society 

then why did not greece invade cyprus 

onur yalcin be that as it may an analogy between an act of occupation in onur yalcin history and what is going on today on azerbaijani land can only onur yalcin be drawn with the expansionist policy that armenia is now pursuing

buch of crap and you know it

nagarnokarabagh has always been part of armenia and it was stalin who gave it to the azeris

go back and review the history

the armenians in nagarnokarabagh are simply defending their rights to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are invading their teritory

onur yalcin but i could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to onur yalcin the political conduct of countries and promulgate them in such onur yalcin terminology as itchybitchy

i was not the one that stated it

however i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one that happened last summer

turkey searched an american plane carrying humanitarian aid bound to armenia

hezbollah and other lebanese resistance fighters are skilled at precision bombing of sla and israeli targets

its hard to beat a carbomb with a suicidal driver in getting right up to the target before blowing up

even boobytraps and radiocontrolled bombs under cars are pretty efficient killers

you have a point

i find such methods to be far more restrained and responsible is this part of your islamic valuesystem

than the israeli method of shelling and bombing villages with the hope that a hezbollah member will be killed along with the civilians murdered

had israeli methods been anything like this then iraq wouldnve been nuked long ago entire arab towns deported and executions performed by the tens of thousands

the fact is though that israeli methods arent even th as evil as those which are common and everyday in arab states

soldiers are trained to die for their country

three idf soldiers did their duty the other day

these men need not have died if their government had kept them on israeli soil

israeli soil

the stories of survivors of karabag massacre are in milliyet today

year old hatin nine telling my twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes

they told me we wont kill you

but the babies have to die in front of your eyes

year old huseyin ibrahimoglu  our turkish village in khojalu town was blown up in two hours

while killing children and babies mercilessly they said you are turks you must die

year old gulsum huseyin  they bayonetted my  year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes

are these stories lies

have the eyewitnesses been daydreaming

were these stories forged by turkish journalists in the region

the nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of british journalists too

two days before we had quoted from a sunday times article

theybritish reported the events in karabag even before turkish journalists

what is more here are the pictures

pictures of people who were bayonetted whose eyes were gouged ears cut off

even the armenian radio couldnt claim these lies

they are saying exaggeration

that means somethings have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported

perhaps that village of khojalu town was destroyed in  hours instead of  or gulsum huseyins  year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach

the massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions

the effects of this massacre on karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word

some of the western press led by some french newspapers ability to close their eyes is nothing but complicity in this massacre

yesterday we gave samples from le figaro

until yesterdays print no news about the real events in karabag were printed

so were the french tv channels

the subject they considered related to karabag was the necessity of protecting armenians against azeri attacks

the age we are living in is termed a human rights age

there are lots of organizations such as united nations and csceconference on security and cooperation in europe and rules all designed to fight against human rights violations

international reactions must be made with international cooperation

with support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized

could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty

where is the cooperation

where are the reactions

and the intellectuals journalists writers tv stations of certain western countries such as france who are fast to claim leadership of human rights

where are you

 believe me i am so relaxed  henrik however i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane henrik to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one oy no henrik believe me you dont hope that

if armenia is goint to do that then so be it

henrik that happened last summer

turkey searched an american plane henrik carrying humanitarian aid bound to armenia

oy was that after or before one french plane changed its route to avoid oy inspection

all i am saying is that the plane that was searched was an american and why turkey did not trust the us that it was mainly humanitarian aid cargo

farid in support of the preservation of the territorial integrity of farid azerbaijan and its independence from russian rule the iranians which farid includes millions of azerbaijanis will have armenia retreat from the farid territory of azerbaijan

oh they will

this should prove quite interesting

farid to count on iranian help to supposedly counter turkish influence will farid be a fatal error on the part of armenia as long as armenia in farid violation of international law has azerbaijani lands in occupation

armenia is not counting on iranian help

as far as violations of international laws which international law gives azerbaijan the right to attack and depopulate the armenians in karabakh

farid if armenian aggression continues in the territory of azerbaijan not farid only there wont be any aid from iran to armenia but also steps will farid be taken to have armenian army back in armenia

and who do you speak for

rafsanjani

farid the azerbaijanis of iran will be the guarantors of this policy

as for farid scaring iranians or turks from the russian power experts on present farid and future military potentials of these people would not put much farid stock on the russain power as the sole power in the region for long

well farid your supposed experts are not expert

the russians have had nonstop influence in the caucasus since the treaty of turkmanchay in 

hmm that makes it    years

oh i see the azeris from iran are going to force out the armenians from karabakh

that will be a real good trick

farid iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the a bomb farid and a reliable delivery system refer to recent news releases farid regarding the potential of iran

so the azeris from iran are going to force the armenians from karabakh by forcing the iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these armenians

farid the moral of the story is that you dont go invading your neighbors farid home azerbaijan and flash russias guns when questioned about it

oh but its just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor

you are a damn fool farid

farid marshal shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding turkey in a farid few short years

so you are going to drop an atomic bomb on russia as well

farid peaceful resolution of the armenianazerbaijani conflict is the only farid way to go

armenia may soon find the fruits of aggression very bitter farid indeed

and the armenians will take your peaceful dropping of an atomic bomb as an example of iranian azeri benevolence

you sir are a poor example of an iranian azeri

questions to israelis nfid rcdpcdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  from center for policy research cpr subject rejoinder

questions to israelis dear josh i appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions

having said that i am not totally happy with your answers



you did not fully answer my question whether israeli id cards identify the holders as jews or arabs

you imply that us citizens must identify themselves by race

is that true 

or are just trying to mislead the reader 

do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests 



the answer to the second question is evasive

there are all kinds of maps issued

they are not equivalent to state policy

you did not respond to my question



your answer to the third question israeli nuclear arsenal is interesting

you say that israeli probably stocks nuclear weapons

what evidence have you for maintaining that 



my fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a maariv article documenting such cases

i did not ask about cases like vanunu everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned



thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories

from it i understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares one for the occupier civil law and one for the occupied military law

the law allows israeli arabs to settle in hebron it seems

if so why doesnt it allow hebron arabs to settle in israel 



your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what i was told namely that hundreds of thousands of nonjews who left for some reason or other the area under israel control during the war of  were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not jews

jews who also left for example to europe to avoid the clashes were allowed to return

how can you justify such discrimination if this is true 

is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland 



somebody answered my question regarding y rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 

according to that information y rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of lydda and ramleh about  people

these expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind bosnia

i was referred to a book by israeli journalist benny goodman called the origin of the palestinian refugee problem published by cambridge university press

is this book available in your library 



you maintain that there are some israeli arabs living in israeli kibbutzim

i wonder how many and where

there is very little evidence available about that

as much as i know many arabs are working for kibbutzim even for many years but are not accepted as members

could it be that kibbutzim do not want arabs 



my question about the lack of civil marriage in israel was whether it is true that the israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage

you did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way

i am certain that if only religious communities in the us would be asked they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages

but israel has always been ruled by a secular majority

your answer is not satisfactory

i would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments

elias

lets not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered

the distinction is not trivial

murder happens to innocent people not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed

it just so happened that these soldiers in the line of duty were killed by the opposition

that still doesnt mean we should cheer their deaths

policemen are also in the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed

should we be happy when they die

as i said before the question is not whether or not you agree with the policies of israel

you may wish for the israelis to cease occupation but dont rejoice in death

marc ed

i am born in palestine now israel

i have family there

the lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life

bullshit

youve been in iceland for the past  years

you told us so yourself

it had something to do with not wanting to suffer the fate of your mother who has lived with jews for a long time or somesuch

sounded awful

i am concerned by palestine israel because i want peace to come to it

peace and justice

are you as concerned about peace and justice in palestine jordan

israeli trights and palestinian rights are not symmetrical

the first party has a state and the other has none

the first is an occupier and the second the occupied

lets say that israel grants the plo everything they ever asked for

that israel goes back to the  borders

what will the palestinean arabs in telaviv call themselves

the palestineans in west jerusalem

in haifa

will they still claim to be occupied

or do you suggest that israel expell or kill off any remaining arabs much as the arabs did to their jews

indeed there is much which is not symmetrical about the conflict in the me

and most of this lack of symmetry does not favor israel

my team  you see was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the  faces of the spectators in my teams viewing stands so to speak

  i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on  in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda

there are no a priori  black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in  retaliation to pinpoint attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the  lebanese terrorists

  if the attack was justified or not is at least debatable

but this is not the  issue

the issue is that you were cheering death

i regret that aspect of my post

it is my hope that the occupation will end and the accompanying loss of life but i believe that stiff resistance can help to achieve that end

 if turks in greece were so badly mistreated how come they elected twom not one but two representatives in the greek government

pardon me

greece government railroads two turkish ethnic deputies while world human rights organizations scream greeks persistently work on removing the parliamentary immunity of dr sadik ahmet and mr ahmet faikoglu

dr sadik ahmet turkish ethnic member of greek parliament visits us washington dc july  doctor sadik ahmet one of the two ethnic turkish members of the greek parliament visited us on june  through july th and held meetings with human rights organizations and highlevel us officials in washington dc and new york

at his press conference at the national press club in washington dc sadik ahmet explained the plight of ethnic turks in greece and stated six demands from greek government

ahmet said our only hope in greece is the pressure generated from western capitals for insisting that greece respects the human rights

what we are having done to ethnic turks in greece is exactly the same as south african apartheid

he added what we are facing is pure greek hatred and racial discrimination

spelling out the demands of the turkish ethnic community in greece he said we want the restoration of greek citizenship of  ethnic turks

their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of greece for too long

they are greek citizens and are residing in greece even one of them is actively serving in the greek army

besides other nonturkish citizens of greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of greekamericans have greek citizenship and they permanently live in the united states

we want guarantee for turkish minoritys equal rights

we want greek government to accept the turkish minority and grant us our civil rights

our people are waiting since  years to get driving licenses

the greek government is not granting building permits to turks for renovating our buildings or building new ones

if your name is turkish you are not hired to the government offices

furthermore we want greek government to give us equal opportunity in business

they do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of greece

in my case they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in greek hospitals despite the fact that i have finished a greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career

we want freedom of expression for ethnic turks

we are not allowed to call ourselves turks

i myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because i called myself a turk

we also want greek government to provide freedom of religion

in separate interview with the turkish times dr sadik ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic turks are deplorable and in the eyes of greek laws ethnic greeks are more equal than ethnic turks

as an example he said there are about  telephone subscribers in selanik thessaloniki and only about  of them are turks

that is not because turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses

he said that greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him

while there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least  of the votes they imposed this requirement for the independent parties including the turkish candidates

ahmet was born in a small village at gumulcine komotini greece 

he earned his medical degree at university of thessaloniki in 

he served in the greek military as an infantryman

in  he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting  signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic turks

in  he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

in article spammathsadelaideeduau jaskewspammathsadelaideeduau joseph askew writes in article aprdasharvardedu adamendoruucp adam shostack writes it depends entirely on how you define war

the actual fighting largely predates the arab invasions  after all deir yassin happened in midapril well before the arab invasion

how do you define war

do seiges and constant attacks on villiages count as acts of war or is that only when the jews do them

i would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might wait until i express an opinion before deciding i should be flamed for it

as for war i am not sure how i would define it

if you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started

would you count the riots in the s and s

violence but not war

i personally think that war as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever requires organisation planning and some measure of regualr or semiregular forces

perhaps the arab liberation army counts

i could easily be convinced it was so

from what i know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation

the haganah and palmach certainly did

that is not a cause for criticism it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the zionist camp

of course this isnt war since its only the arabs attacking

now you are being silly arent you

in any case the war did not start with the invasion of the arab armies

you see we both agree on something

and the previous posters were wrong no

just like last week when the fatah launched katyusha rockets against northern israel

where does uprising end and war begin

again i am not sure i doubt you want my opinion anyway but i think war requires organisation as i said before

it needs a group to command and plan

if fatah lauches rockets from southern lebanon and are you sure you have the right group  not the moslems again

then that sounds like war to me

stone throwing does not

in article aprcsritedu bdmcsritedu brendan d mckay writes  i have previously posted quotations by irgun participants that totally destroys begins whitewash

i have no particular desire to post it yet again

 brendan

normally bdmcsanueduau  you apparently think you are some sort of oneman judge and jury who so what are you

can declare total victory and then sit back and enjoy the applause

but youve picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged quotations can sustain the legend and lie of the deir yassin massacre

i dont think that you are just making noise

you have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology

thats true

i try to learn from people who know more than me not from useless farts

at the most basic level you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding quotations that support your preset opinions

of course i have said that more times in this group than anyone else id think

if you have studied the history of israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your quotations have an axe to grind and therefore you must be very careful about whom you quote

for quite true thats why i am so careful in selecting quotes

example meir pail whom you cite was indeed a general a scholar and a war hero

but that doesnt mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold

in fact and here your lack of experience shows pail is such a fanatic embittered leftist that much of his oh bullshit

fanatic my bum

prove your blah or cork it

antiisrael blathering forget about antiirgun blathering would be considered something like treason in nonisrael contexts

but of course you dont consider this at all when you find a juicy quotation that you can use to attack israel

how would you know what i consider

read my mind

benny morris of hashomer hatzair represents himself as a scholar when he rehashes the old attacks on the irgun

dont be fooled

its just the old zionist ideological catfight surfacing as an attack on the then likud government

if you will look closely at the section on deir yassin in his book on the war of independence you will see his indictment to be pure hot air

and this is the best he can do after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence

unfortunately for him because his book parades itself as scholarly he is forced to put footnotes

so you can clearly see that his deir yassin account is based on nothing

i looked very closely at a large number of sources

you have no idea what you are talking about

the deir yassin massacre never took place as the propagandists tell it any more than the sabra and shatila massacres

do you get thats true about the accounts of both irgun and arab propagandists

like begin for example

the feeling people like to blame the jews for massacres even if no i never got that feeling

i got rather opposite feelings about people like you though

they have to make them up

it must sound spicy

even some jews like to do it for reasons of their own

honesty

perhaps you would explain the testimony from members of the irgun to be found in their own handwriting in the irgun archives in tel aviv that the wounded arabs were killed that a group of  prisoners was massacred that lehi proposed exterminating everybody at the preraid meeting

exactly what reasons can you propose that this testimony should be rejected in favour of begins

please dont confuse any of you deir yassin massacre stuff with facts or scholarship

you should stick to begins version unless you find something serious to contradict it

this is very funny

you carried on about unsupported evidence propagandists axes to grind and you end up telling us to stick to the account of the leader of the alleged killers

you are obviously a hopeless case as everyone can plainly see

vic brendan

 abzvirginiaedu andi beyer writes   i think the israeli press might be a tad bit biased in  reporting the events

i doubt the propaganda machine of goering  reported accurately on what was happening in germany

it is  interesting that you are basing the truth on israeli propaganda

  if you consider israeli reporting of events in israel to be propoganda then  consider the washington posts handling of american events to be propoganda  too

what makes the israeli press inherently biased in your opinion

i  wouldnt compare it to nazi propoganda either

unless you want to provide  some evidence of israeli inaccuracies or parallels to nazism i suggest you  keep your mouth shut

im sick and tired of all you antisemites comparing  israel to the nazis and yes in my opinion if you compare israel to the nazis  you are an antisemite because you know damn well it isnt true and you are  just trying to discredit israel

  ed

 you know ed youre right

andi shouldnt be comparing israel to the nazis

the israelis are much worse than the nazis ever were anyway

the nazis did a lot of good for germany and they would have succeeded if it werent for the damn jews

the holocaust never happened anyway

ample evidence given by george schafer at harvard dept

of history and even by randolph higgins at nyu have shown that the holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain sympathy to piush for the creation of israel

  lebanese resistance forces detonated a bomb under an israeli occupation  patrol in lebanese territory two days ago

three soldiers were killed and  two wounded

in retaliation israeli and israelibacked forces wounded   civilians by bombarding several lebanese villages

ironically the israeli  government justifies its occupation in lebanon by claiming that it is  necessary to prevent such bombardments of israeli villages

  congratulations to the brave men of the lebanese resistance

with every  israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral  bankruptcy of israels occupation and drawing attention to the israeli  governments policy of reckless disregard for civilian life

  brad hernlem hernlemchessncsuedu im sure the federal bureau of investigation fbigov on the internet is going to love reading your incitement to murder

josh backonvmshujiacil

 is there any israeli a civilian in your opinion 

  now i do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages

 but you claim these are villages with civilians and iraelis claim they are  camps filled with terrorists

you claim that israelis shell the villages with the  hope of finding a terrorist or so

if they kill one fine if not too bad  civilians die right 

i am not so sure

i am

i was back in my home village this last summer

for your information we are people not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists

most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee

is that so hard to imagine 

it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc

some young men usually aged between  to  years are members of the lebanese resistance

even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to

these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time

they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols

every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an  year old girl just happened to be

we are now accustomed to israeli tactics and we figure that this is the israeli way of telling us that if youre gonna hurt our soldiers youre gonna pay the price

we accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers

israels retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw

the people of south lebanon are occupied or shelled by israel on a regular basis

we do not want to be occupied

if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers

if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land

we are not asking for the establishment of a lebanese occupied zone in northern israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by israel so the best policy seems to be the removal of israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border

i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled

this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed

in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in

if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the socalled security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks

such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israels public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions

along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it

there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon

 if you ask me those questions i will have no problem answering not with a  question as you did  no nobody is qualified candidate for murder nothing  justifies murder

i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing cannot be qualified as murder no matter what you say

i have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make  similar statements maybe after eliminating all israelis jews 

am i wrong 

yes we have no quarrel with jews or israeli civilians

the real problem is with occupying israeli soldiers and those brave israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an occupying soldier is attacked

in fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place

people die that is all

no one gets killed

maybe also vietamiese didnt die in vietnam war killed by american napalm they were just pyromaniacs and thats all

maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in therethey may be thought it was like snifing cocaine

r lines  today marks the th anniversary of the armenian genocide of 

million turks and kurds in eastern anatolia and xsoviet armenia

the following letter which represents a small portion of the full text along with more than  pages of historical documents scholarly sources eyewitness accounts and photographs was sent to president bill clinton members of congress editors program directors and columnists of major newspapers journals and radiotv stations for the th anniversary of the armenian genocide of 

million muslim people

on april  of every year the people of turkiye remember their dead

they grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers

this year the turkish nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the turkish land happily and prosperously

letter  during the years of world war i the xsoviet armenian government has planned and perpetrated the genocide of the muslim people which not only took the lives of 

million muslim people but was also the method used to empty the turkish homeland of its inhabitants

to this day turkish historic lands remain occupied by the xsoviet armenia

in order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic turkish homeland which is the crux of turkish political demands fascist xsoviet armenia continues its antiturkish policy in the following ways 

xsoviet armenia denies the historical fact of the turkish genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility



xsoviet armenia employing asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle attempts to call into question the veracity of the turkish genocide



xsoviet armenia has also implemented statesponsored terrorism through the asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle in an attempt to silence the turkish peoples vehement demands and protests



using all its human financial and governmental resources xsoviet armenia and its tools in the united states attempt to silence through terrorism bribery and other subversive methods nonturkish supporters of the turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian

using all the aforementioned methods the xsoviet armenian government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the turkish case a contemporary issue

yet despite the efforts of the xsoviet armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the armenians the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the turkish genocide

with the full knowledge that the struggle for the turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages the turkish and kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle therefore the victims of the turkish genocide demand 

that the xsoviet armenian government as the heirs of the armenian dictatorship recognize the turkish genocide 

that xsoviet armenia return the historic homeland to the turkish and kurdish people 

that the xsoviet armenian government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the turkish genocide 

that all world governments and especially the united states officially recognize the turkish genocide and turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all armenian political pressure 

that the us government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally xsoviet armenia and officially recognize the historical fact of the turkish genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of turkish territorial demands 

that the xsoviet republics officially recognize the historical fact of the turkish genocide and include the coldblooded extermination of 

million muslim people in their history books

the awareness of the turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the turkish cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the th century as a positive step

furthermore a new generation has risen  equipped with a deep sense of commitment politically mature and conscious who determinedly pursue the turkish cause through all necessary means ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle

therefore the victims of the turkish genocide call upon all muslims in the united states and canada to participate vigorously in the political cultural and religious activities of the th anniversary of the armenian genocide of 

million muslim people

serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination

from dbdurartusdpaorg david davidian subject armenia says it could shoot down turkish planes organization sdpa

center for regional studies lines    armenia says it could shoot down turkish planes by david ljunggren moscow april  reuter  armenia accused turkey on friday of flying weapons x and troops across armenian airspace to azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down local journalists in yerevan said

separately itartass news agency said armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up onetenth of azerbaijan and sent tensions in the transcaucasian region soaring

the journalists in the armenian capital quoted armen duliyan head of the armenian defence ministry press centre as saying ankara had been sending planes up to  times a day to azerbaijan with arms and troops

it looks as though the armenian leadership will have to warn turkey about the impermissibility of such actions the journalists quoted duliyan as saying

if such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures

we have all the necessary means including modern antiaircraft units

turkey which shares a border with armenia has supported azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly armenianpopulated nagornokarabakh region in which more than  people have been killed since fighting erupted in 

the turkish foreign ministry said on friday it had so far sent one plane to azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid

a turkish foreign ministry spokesman on thursday would not comment directly on a report by hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets rocket launchers ammunition and light weapons had arrived in azerbaijan from turkey

duliyan said turkey had been sending up to  trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering azeri autonomous territory of nakhichevan from where they were flown across armenian airspace to the azeri capital baku

all the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace he said

armenia denies any formal role in the conflict saying that the troops involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself

tass said the karabakh forces decided on friday to suspend their offensive along the entire armenianazerbaijani front

the karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the enclaves leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire the agency said

armenian president levon terpetrosyan called for a twostage ceasefire in karabakh when he arrived in the belarus capital minsk on friday for a summit of commonwealth leaders

the first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the karabakh population tass quoted him as saying

at least  ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed

the second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues that is a clarification of the status of nagornokarabakh he said

the republic declared full independence last year but the move has not been recognised by any other country

armenia insists that a separate karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks something azerbaijan rejects

local news agencies in baku said on friday that interior minister iskender gamidov a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with armenia had resigned

turan news agency said he quit on thursday and had cleared his office

khabarservis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of baku police majorgeneral abdullah allakhverdiyev

the turkish government is good at excising text from their references lets see how good thay are at adding text to verifiable newspaper accounts

the turkish government cant support any of their antiarmenian claims as typified in the above scribed garbage

that government continues to make false and libelous charges for they have no recourse left after having made fools out of through their attempt at a systematic campaign at denying and covering up the turkish genocide of the armenians

just like a dog barking at a moving bus it barks jumps yells until the bus stops at which point it just walks away

such will be with this posting

turkish agents level the most ridiculous charges and when brought to answer they are silent like the dog after the bus stops

the turkish government feels it can funnel a heightened state of ultra nationalism existing in turkey today onto usenet and convince people via its revisionist myopic and incidental view of themselves and their place in the world

the resulting inability to address armenian and greek refutations of turkeys rewrite of history is to refer to me as a terrorist and worse claim  as part of the record  i took responsibility for the murder of  people

how did you get to be so retarded

system fourdcom phone  cute quote being a computer means never having to say youre sorry

greater armenia would stretch from karabakh to the black sea to the mediterranean so if you use the term greater armenia use it with care

finally you said what you dream about

mediterranean

that was new

the area will be greater after some years like your holocaust numbers it has always been up to the azeris to end their announced winning of karabakh by removing the armenians

when the president of azerbaijan elchibey came to power last year he announced he would be be swimming in lake sevan in armeniaxn by july

ist july in usa now

here in sweden its april and still cold

or have you changed your calendar

well he was wrong

if elchibey is going to shell the armenians of karabakh from aghdam his people will pay the price

if elchibey  is going to shell karabakh from fizuli his people will pay the price

if  elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing armenia from the hills of kelbajar his people will pay the price

nothing of the mentioned is true but let say its true

shall the azeri women and children going to pay the price with  being raped killed and tortured by the armenians

have you hearded something called geneva convention

you facist

ohhh i forgot this is how armenians fight nobody has forgot you killings rapings and torture against the kurds and turks once upon a time

and anyway this  kurd refugee story as have other stories are simple fabrications sourced in baku modified in ankara

other examples of this are armenia has no border with iran and the ridiculous story of the intercepting of armenian military conversations as appeared in the new york times supposedly translated by somebody unknown from armenian into azeri turkish submitted by an unnamed special correspondent to the ny times from baku

real accurate

ohhhh so swedish redcross workers do lie they too

what ever you say regional killer if you dont like the person then shoot him thats your policyl he search turkish planes

you dont know what you are talking about he since its content is announced to be weapons

i i well big mouth ozal said military weapons are being provided to azerbaijan i from turkey yet demirel and others say no

no wonder you are so confused

i i i confused

i you facist when you delete text dont change it i wrote i i search turkish planes

you dont know what you are talking about

i turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons i to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan it self not the karabag province

so why search a plane for weapons since its content is announced to be weapons

if there is one thats confused then thats you

we have the right and we do to give weapons to the azeris since armenians started the fight in azerbadjan

you are correct all turkish planes should be simply shot down

nice slow moving air transports

shoot down with what

armenian bread and butter

or the arms and personel of the russian army

hilmi eren stockholm university

 mr tamamidis before repling your claims i suggest you be kind to individuals who are trying to make some points abouts human rights discriminations and unequal treatment of turkish minority in greecei want the world know how bad you treat these people

you will deny anything i say but it does not make any difrence because i will write things that i saw with my eyesyou prove yourself prejudice by saying free insurance school etc

do you greeks only give these things to turkish minority or everybody has rights to get themyour words even discriminate these people

you think that you are giving big favor to these people by giving these thing that in reality they get nothing

no

i do not thing we are doing them a favor

i have simply stated that they are not treated as a second class citizens

that was my point

i fail to see how my words show discrimination

and what do you mean that they do not get nothing

is for example helth insurance food and tuition nothing

if you do not know unhuman practices that are being conducted by the government of the greece i suggest that you investigate to see the facts

then we can discuss about the most basic human rights like fredom of religion fredom of press of turkish minority ethnic cleansing of all turks in greecefredom of right to have property without government intervention fredom of right to vote to choose your community leaders how greek government encourages people to destroy religious places houses farms schools for turkish minority then forcing them to go to turkey without anything with them

im sorry but i cannot see any logical order in the above argument

before i conclude my writing let me point out how greeks are treated in turkey

we do not consider them greek minority instead we consider a part of our society

what part exactly is this one

the people cannot even sell their property if they want to leave turkey

the patriarch could not get a permision to renovate some buildings for decades it needed a special agreement between the two goverments for this

talk about a part of the society

why has the size of the greek community reduced to  old people and priests then

there is no difference among people in turkey

yeah you bet

all big businesses belong to greeks in turkey and we are proud to have themunlike the greece which tries to destroy turkish minority we encourage all minorities in turkey to be a part of turkish society

you are far off from the reality

this implies both sides are equal

true it may sometimes be difficult or still living in an alternate universe

numerous articles in major newspapers london times and periodicals newsweek during the war had suggested the existence of a significant collaboration between armenians and the nazis

arthur derounian deserves credit for being the first person to deal with this issue extensively

derounians motives were twofold his deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of armenian history

concurrently derounian embarked on what one would call crisis control or facesaving

in order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger armenian community in the united states he marginalized collaboration as deplorable but insignificant

source mitteilungsblatt berlin december  nr

and  yet another historical fact a fact that for years has been deliberately forgotten concealed and wiped from memory  the fact of armeniannazi collaboration

a magazine called mitteilungsblatt der deutscharmenischen gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration

the magazine was first published in berlin in  during nazi rule of germany and continued publication until the end of 

even the name of the magazine which implies a declaration of armeniannazi cooperation is attentiongetting

this magazine every issue of which proves the collaboration is historically important as documentary evidence

it is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind

in nazi germany armenians were considered to be an aryan race and certain political economic and social rights were thus granted to them

they occupied positions in public service and were partners in nazi practices

the whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered aryan and what befell them

now wait there is more

your three chiefs dro hamazasp and kulkhandanian are the ringleaders of the bands which have destroyed tartar villages and have staged massacres in zangezour surmali etchmiadzin and zangibasar

this is intolerable

look  and here he pointed to a file of official documents on the table  look at this here in december are the reports of the last few months concerning ruined tartar villages which my representative wardrop has sent me

the official tartar communique speaks of the destruction of  villages

p  fifth paragraph

yes of course

i repeat until this massacre of the tartars is stopped and the three chiefs are not removed from your military leadership i hardly think we can supply you arms and ammunition

it is the armed bands led by dro hamazasp and kulkhandanian who during the past months have raided and destroyed many tartar villages in the regions of surmali etchmiadzin zangezour and zangibasar

there are official charges of massacres

 in article aprnewshubarielyorkuca nabilarielyorkuca nabil gangi writes   according to exodus there were  jews that marched out of egypt

  this is only the number of adult males

the total number of jewish  slaves leaving egypt was much larger

  the number which could have arrived to the holy lands must have been  substantially less ude to the harsh desert and the killings between the  jewish tribes on the way    nabil   typical arabic thinking

if we are guilty of something so is  everyone else

unfortunately for you nabil jewish tribes are not  nearly as susceptible to the fratricidal murdering that is still so  common among arabs in the middle east

there were no  killings  between the jewish tribes on the way

i dont like this comment about typical thinking

you could state your interpretation of exodus without it

as i read exodus i can see a lot of killing there which is painted by the author of the bible in ideologicalreligious colors

the history in the desert can be seen as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land

thats why i think it is a great book with which descendants arabs turks and mongols can unify as well

from ebrahimeeumanitobaca mohamad ebrahimi subject pbs frontline iran and the bomb nntppostinghost iceeumanitobaca organization elect  comp engineering u of manitoba winnipeg manitobacanada lines  i would like to share with netters a few points i picked up from the pbs frontline program regarding irans nuclear activities aired on tuesday april 

for the sake of brevity ill present them in some separate points

as many other western programs this program was laid on a bed of misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the program on the viewer

some of the misinformations were as follows  it was alleged that late imam khomeini objected to shahs technological advancements as antiislamic but now things have changed and the proof of change is that some iranian merchants are now selling personal computers



these are the most ridiculous lies one can make about the objectives of the islamic revolution in toppling the shah and state of the technology in iran after revolution

iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against iraqi aggressors while there has never been any proof in this regard and nobody has seen iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by iranian chemical weapons in contrary to what the whole world has seen about iranian soldiers and civilians injured by iraqi chemical weapons

while the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against iraqi aggression has been officially announced to be about  and even most radical counterrevolutionary groups claim that iran and iraq had a total of one million dead this program claims that iran alone has one million dead left from the war

the translation of iranian officials talks are not  true

for example when iranian head of atomic energy says that  it hurts me to see that iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda

the translator says  it hurts to see that iran is doing unfriendly research

almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought by iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to irans big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in near future and its current deficit in electrical power

the whole program is trying to show the sharif university of technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the program know well that in a country like iran without a so tightly closed society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university

taking in account the scientific advancement of sharif u in engineering fields and its potential role in improvement of irans industries and eventually the lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones in scientific and industrial efforts

a key point in programs justifications is trying to disvalidate as much as possible all efforts done by iaea  in their numerous visits from irans different sites

they say we are not sure if the places visited by iaea are the real ones or not  or  we can not rely on iaeas reports and observation because they failed to see iraqs nuclear activities before as if they didnt know that iraq was trying to build nuclear weapons

as an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the program was the arrogance of the member of us senate foreign affairs william triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking from the absolute knowledge

i hope all iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their country in western media and i hope iranian authorities continue to their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations

 what is a shame is that in austria daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by israeli soldiers  it wasnt all that long ago that the acts of israeli soldiers were described as superhuman

now they are inhuman

did the israelis change so radically so quickly or have reporting attitudes changed

 and the blessing received from the government makes some of the holocaust guilt go away

after all look how the jews are treating other races when they got power

when the jews were powerless they did what they could to help others which was obviously quite limited

later liberated american jews were on the forefront of the civilrights movement

the jewish government of israel rescued jews ranging in skin color from white russian to brown yemenite to black ethiopian

please andi tell us how the jews are treating other races when they got power

it is unfortunate

your ignorance and bias are indeed unfortunate

i believe that most of the world has seen pictures of israeli soldiers who were breaking the cameras of the reporters kicking reporters out confiscating cassettes and showing reporters militery orders preventing them from going to hot areas to pick pictures and make reports

 i guess hasan finally revealed the source of his claim that israel  diverted water from lebanonhis imagination

   alan h stein asteinisraelnysernetorg mr waterhead i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers in fact i said that israel went into southern lebanon to make sure that no water is being used on the lebanese side so that all water would run into jordan river where there israel will use it head

henrik the armenians in nagarnokarabagh are simply defending their henrik rights to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are henrik invading their homeland

he homeland

first nagarnokarabagh was armenians homeland today he fizuli lacin and several villages in azerbadjan he are their homeland

cant you see the he the great armenia dream in this

with facist methods like he killing raping and bombing villages

the last move was the he blast of a truck with  kurdish refugees trying to he escape the from lacin a city that was given to the kurds he by the armenians

nagornokarabakh is in azerbaijan not armenia

armenians have lived in nagorno karabakh ever since there were armenians

armenians used to live in the areas between armenia and nagornokarabakh and this area is being used to invade nagorno karabakh

armenians are defending themselves

if azeris are dying because of a policy of attacking armenians then something is wrong with this policy

if i recall correctly it was stalin who caused all this problem with land in the first place not the armenians

henrik however i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane henrik to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one henrik that happened last summer

turkey searched an american plane henrik carrying humanitarian aid bound to armenia

he dont speak about things you dont know  us

cargo planes he were heading to armenia

when the turkish authorities he announced that they were going to search these cargo he planes  of these planes returned to its base in germany

he  of these planes were searched in turkey

the content of he of the other  planes

not hard to guess is it

it was sure not he humanitarian aid what story are you talking about

planes from the us have been sending aid into armenian for two years

i would not like to guess about what were in the  planes in your story i would like to find out

he search turkish planes

you dont know what you are talking about

he turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons he to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan he it self not the karabag province

so why search a plane for weapons he since its content is announced to be weapons

its too bad you would want turkey to start a war with armenia

 any concentrationlabor camp in turkey around  or later for cypriot greeks or any greeks rather than talking nonsense like above i will be glad to read what they got

 how can you be in a position to know about any kind of concentration camps akgun

living through those days at the age of  and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position

in  turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time

forget about internal news agencies i havent heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey

however i heard adana pow camp

it was not secret and well recognized pow camp

 as for all the registered prisoners to the red cross having returned to their homes this is your version of the story

there are cases in which prisoners who were registered some of them even sent messages to their relatives were not released

these are undeniable facts

i see they vanished in turkish labor camps

turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them

is that it

what do you think happened to them

i thought that mias are only the subject of rambo and chuck noris movies

seems that i am wrong

 as for their treatment being according to what convention

okay we believe you

you dont need to belive me

turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history it has been a respected and continuous member of un since the inception of un

no body ever questioned the un membership of turkey because of what had happened in a and after

only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the internal greek loby

i know what you would say next

let me answer it before wasting anytime

yes

un had a few condemning resolutions against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem especially after the  coup

well us and israel had a few too

what can i say

i am sure during athens junta duruing  greeks had their own share too

closed matter today between turkish cypriotsturksgreeksgreek cypriots

there is no more any official demand from greek cypriots about any missing greek cypriots

 where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the missing persons

have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks mediated by gali

there was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties

was there

i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and international press

he keeps saying that this was no longer an issue for peace talks

also you dont want me fish for the greek cypriot politicians words that argic had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as a greekcypriot myth

seems that there is a different opinions among greekcypriots as well about missing people in turkish custody

 your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed in the period between the coup deta and the invasion  days is simply not true

all the cases of missing persons i know and i know quite a few are cases of people who were either in the reserve forces and were lost somewhere in the battlefield or were civilians who were taken prisoners in their villages by the turkish army

i am not claiming anything

i just told you what was given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish govermentturkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between july  and the final ceasefire in late august 

this answer seems to satisfy the international community the un and the vasilu goverment since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks

also i am not aware of any un condemnation against turkey about any missing greekcypriot

are you

btw do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup deta and nobody got hurt in those events

 as of the few photos which you refer to there are more than a few

there are photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being rounded up but also others in the prison camp in turkey

like i said before

there is even a different opinion among greekcypriots for this myth

the officers in turkish army who governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes to cover up their tracks 

i hope turkish army doest have same type of morons for the security of turkiye

however this must a good subject for a movie script

one should inform oliver stone about this

  of course not

the justice was served well

if and when the bosnian pleas are answered whos going to dare to ask what happens to those masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing idea

they are known today as eokab masterminds were known in  to everybody and are doing it openly even giving tv interviews

it may take same time as it was for the eokab case however the justice will be served again

 akgun comparing the actions of the serbians in bosnian with the  actions of  turkey in cyprus is not something i would do if i were a turk

 i thought that the serbians were the savages the inhumane beasts etc etc

 the latest israeli proposal first proposed in february of  contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the wb and gaza the palestinians implemented by negotiations

it states that  israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status  is agreed upon  israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the  interim selfgovernment arrangements isga  the isga will apply to the palestinian inhabitants of the territories  under israeli military administration

the arrangements will not have a  territorial application nor will they apply to the israeli population  of the territories or to the palestinian inhabitants of jerusalem  residual powers not delegated under the isga will be reserved by israel  israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd  israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects  external internal and for the maintenance of public order  the organs of the isga will be of an administrativefunctional nature  the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and  coordination with israel

 israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the  areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education  business tourism labor and social welfare local police  local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious  affairs

 the palestinian counterproposal of march   the establishment of a palestinian interim selfgoverning authority  pisga whose authority is vested by the palestinian people  its pisga powers cannot be delegated by israel  in the interim phase the israeli military government and civil adminis  tration will be abolished and the pisga will asume the powers previous  ly enjoyed by israel  there will be no limitations on its pisga powers and responsibilities  except those which derive from its character as an interim arrangement  by the time pisga is inaugurated the israeli armed forces will have  completed their withdrawal to agreed points along the borders of the  occupied palestinian territory opt

the opt includes jerusalem  the jurisdiction of the pisga shall extend to all of the opt including  its land water and air space  the pisga shall have legislative powers to enact amend and abrogate laws  it will wield executive power withput foreign control  it shall determine the nature of its cooperation with any state or  international body and shall be empowered to conclude binding coopera  tive agreements free of any control by israel  the pisga shall administer justice throughout the opt and will have sole  and exclusive jruisdiction  it will have a strong police force responsible for security and public  order in the opt  it can request the assistance of a un peacekeeping force  disputes with israel over selfgoverning arrangements will be settled by  a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of  the un security council the secretary general of the un the pisga  jordan egypt syria and israel

 but perhaps the bargaining attitude behind these very different visions of the interim stage is wrong

for two reasons  the present palestinian and israeli leadership are as moderate as is likely to exist for many years so the present opportunity may be the last for a significant period  since these negotiations are not designed to or even attempting to resolve the conflict attention to issues dealing with a desired final status are mis placed and potentially destructive

 given this how should proposals from either side be altered to temper their maximalist approaches as stated above

how can israeli worries and desire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a very real interim palestinian selfgoverning entity

 tim  april   response by al moore llmscislmsclockheedcom basically the problem is that israel may remain or leave the occupied territories it cannot do both it cannot do neither

so far israe continues to propose that they remain

the palestinians propose that they leave

why should either change their view

it is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the israeli presence

israel proposes no such reduction and in fact may be said to not be negotiating

tim there seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed

the first is that of israel where there is little trust for arab groups so there is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in exchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc

the second is that of the arab worldpalestinians where there is the demand that these tangible concessions be made by israel without it receiving anything tangible back

given this the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns for its expected concessions

by tangible is meant something that  provides israel with comparable protection from the land it is to give up  in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine will be accountable and held actively not just diplomatically responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens or visitors

in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel was assured that any new palestinian state would be committed to coexisting with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel from its territory

aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above how could such guarantees be instilled

for example how could such guaranteescontrols be added to the palestinian pisga proposals

israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go gives lands back to arab states no more buffer zone gives full autonomy to palestinians any andor all of the arab parties could and would if not controlled somehow easily return to the traditional antiisrael position

the question then is how to really ensure that that will not happen

tim

i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda

thank you bradali for warning us about the dangers of propaganda

its funny though coming from you

there are no a priori black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in retaliation to pinpoint attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the lebanese terrorists

who is it that executes these pinpoint attacks on israelis

the guys in the white hats or the ones in the black hats

neither

you mean that they are just civilians farmers teachers school children

well maybe they are terrorists after all

and maybe that propaganda was correct too

in  this battalion had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of dro the butcher who is the architect of the coldblooded genocide of 

million turks and kurds between 

an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis

encouraged by this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitlers policy of extermination of the jews

i have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of russians and armenians from turkish territories through armenia

although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of armenian gangs i have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the armenians at almost every step

all the villages from trabzon to erzincan and from erzincan to erzurum are destroyed

corpses of turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere

according to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains the first horrible and fearful events begun when the russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by armenian gangs

the russians usually treated the people well but the people feared the intervention of the armenians

once these places had been taken over by the armenians however the massacres begun

they clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the armenian and kurdish land from the turks and thus solve the nationality problem

today i had the opportunity to meet austrian and german soldiers who had escaped from russian prison camps and come from kars and alexander paul gumruleninakanrussian officers tried to save the turks and there were clashes between russian officers and armenian gangs

i am now in erzurum and what i see is terrible

almost the whole city is destroyed

the smell of the corpses still fills the air

although there are speculations that armenian gangs murdered austrian and german prisoners as well i could not get the supporting evidence in this regard but there is proof of murdering of turkish prisoners of war

well you should have noted that i was cheering an attack on an israeli patrol inside lebanese territory while i was condemning the retaliatory shelling of lebanese villages by israeli and israelibacked forces

my team you see was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the faces of the spectators in my teams viewing stands so to speak

i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda

there are no a priori black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in retaliation to pinpoint attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the lebanese terrorists

if the attack was justified or not is at least debatable

but this is not the issue

the issue is that you were cheering death

read again your original article

you find israeli government responsible for those dead soldiers thats a reasonable debatable point but feel satisfaction from dead bodies is not reasonable by any standards

no matter how you try to justify it

i may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in s lebanon

but no matter what you say i can not understand your satisfaction for dead bodies

i have a question for you

lets assume a bosnian village inhabited by serbs untill a few  years ago and later taken over by bosnian muslims the means are not very peaceful

now do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all armed bosnian muslims 

i would not enjoy but i would not enjoy any dead bodies  israelis lebanese or bosnians

you all are an insult to you race

assuming you are also semitic now i have a comment concerning israeli terrorism during the s and s the hirgun and other branch  off militant groups did fight the british do get them out of palestine

yet i fail to see how this israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the arabs

these jewish terrorist groups killed innocent british soldiers but not only thta also killed many jews who were in favor of a compromise with the palestinians

in addition they massacred an entire palestinian village in  contributing to the exodus of the frightened palestinians who feared their very lives

i mention this not because im anti semitic im part jewish but because this self righteousness on the part of the israelites pisses me off so

im not as critical of the palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the jews

it s a damn shame that the palestinians had to pay for german and european anti semitism

pissed off at immature closeminded self righteous semites

from bcclevelandfreenetedu mark ira kaufman subject re israels expansion ii organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost thorinscwruedu the comparison of the palestinian situation with the holocaust is insulting and completely false

any person making such a rude and false comparison is either ignorant of the holocaust or also ignorant of the situation in the mideast or is an antisemite

what gives you the fiat to look into the minds of israeli generals

has this policy of intimidation been published somewhere

for your information the actions taken by arabs specifically the plo were not uncommon in the lebanon campaign of 

my brain is full of shit

at least i dont look into the minds of others and make israeli policy for them

  deleted i am not in the business of reading minds however in this case it would not be necessary

israelis top leaders in the past and present always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the arabs

how would you deal with arabs who always threaten to drive you into the sea or burn half your conuntry

would you talk nicely

would you say please

you wouldnt

the language of the middle east is power and force

sorry  that is the way it is now

if you arent strong you go down

israel has to talk and act tough

notice israel talks and acts tough in battle but is willing to talk peace

the way i see it israelis and arabs have not been able to achieve peace after almost  years of fighting because of the following two major reasons   arab governments are not really representative of their people currently  most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor  dictators

true  and they have brainwashed their people into thinking jews are some sort of monsters

arab nonrecognition of israel and support of war and terror is also an important factor wouldnt you say

  israeli government is arrogant and none comprising

what do you want israel to do

they are negotating

im sick of people calling for israel to withdraw from the territories now

thats not realistic dont you realize that

a solution must be negotiated

it is on the table

have patience

by the way i do not applaud the killing of any human being including prisoners sentenced to death by our illustrious justice department  peace

our justice department does not sentence people to death

thats up to state courts

most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee

is that so hard to imagine 

quickly followed by some young men usually aged between  to  years are members of the lebanese resistance

even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to

this is the standard method for claiming noncombatant status even for the commanders of combat

these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time

they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols

every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

innocent civilians

like the ones who set up the booby traps or engaged in shootouts with soldiers or attack them with grenades or axes

we are now accustomed to israeli tactics and we figure that this is and the rest of the world is getting used to arab tactics of claiming innocence for even the most guilty of the vile murderers among them

 problem    my father told me the following story

during the famous wars between the  armenians and the persians prince zaurak kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds

three times in a single month he attacked the persian troops

 the first time he struck down half of the persian army

the second time  pursuing the persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers

the third  time he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army

the persians who were  still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to nakhichevan

and so from  this remainder find how many persian soldiers there were before the  massacre

 answer a  a   corollary armenians strike slaughter destroy and massacre

after all  they are not as innocent as the asala network claims

hmm  turks sure know how to keep track of deaths but they seem to lose count around

from the writings of tye biographers you quoted i can perceive maybe chauvinistically the remnants of her armenian genes

even though she is only th armenian she seems to have many of the strong characteristics of armenian women

her armenian ancestry is traced to eliza kewark an armenian from india who married the scottish merchant thedore forbes

from the union was born kathleen scott forbes who married james crombie from aberdeen

they had a daughter jane who married david littlejohn

their daughter ruth married william gill

ruth silvia gill the grandmother of lady diana married lord fermoy and their daughter frances ruth burke roache married the eight earl of spencer who was the father of lady diana

it is noteworthy that eliza kewark was also referred to as mrs forbesian a characteristic armenian surname ending

anyway the armenians tore apart the ottoman empires eastern provinces massacred 

million defenseless turkish women children and elderly people burned thousands of turkish and kurdish villages and exterminated the entire turkish population of the armenian dictatorship between 

such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in armenia brings a depth and verification to the turkish genocide that is hard to match

a hundred years ago armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the russian anarchists that they accepted as role models

several armenian terror groups like asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle resorted to the same tactics in the s butchering scores of innocent turks and their families in the united states and europe

it seems that they are doing it again at a different scale in fascist xsoviet armenia today

in april  dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city of van whose  armenians comprised 

percent of the population closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empireleaving erivan on april   armenian volunteers reached van on may  and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during the next two days while the small ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake

knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims

armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire and to assist instead other invading russian armies

their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories

armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves

with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in  at the beginning of world war i the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottomans enemy increased drastically

ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies

 from center for policy research cpr  a unconventional proposal for peace in the middleeast

 by  elias davidsson of all the stupid postings youve brought here recently it is illuminating that you chose to put your own name on perhaps the stupidest of them

the following proposal is based on the following assumptions  

fundamental human rights such as the right to life to education to establish a family and have children to human dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc

are more important to human existence that the rights of states

does this mean that you are calling for the dismantling of the arab states



in the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail

apparently your answer is yes



attempts to solve the israeliarab conflict by traditional political means have failed

attempts to solve these problem by traditional military means and nontraditional terrorist means has also failed

but that wont stop them from trying again

after all it is a holy war you know 

as long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnicalreligious communitiespeoples which claim the land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible

no just solution possible

how very encouraging

having stated my assumptions i will now state my proposal

you mean that it gets even funnier



a fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is israelijew and the other palestinianarab

 

for the first child the grant will amount to  for the second the third child 

for each child

for each subsequent child the grant will amount to 

for each child

 

the fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the israeliarab conflict no the fund should be financed by the center for policy research

it is a major organization isnt it

isnt it



the emergence of a considerable number of mixed marriages in israelpalestine all of whom would have relatives on both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society

yeah just like marriages among arabs has strengthened their societies

the existence of a strong mixed stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middleeast in a graceful manner

the world could do with a bit less middle eastern grace

objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced

i will attempt to identify some of these boy youre a oneman band

i have met  so many greeks who wouldnt even talk to me because i am turkish

from my  experience all my friends always were open to greeks   well the history wars current situations all of them do not help

well panos mr

tamamidis the way you put it it is only the turks who bear the responsibility of the things happening today

that is hard to believe for somebody trying to be objective

well if you put things into historical perspective the turks moved into an area which was inhabited by greeks

this is how the history between the two nations started some centuries ago

since then it has been a continuous battle between the two nations

from my perspective i cant see why i should say that greeks have been responsible for what has happened between the two nations

of course it would not be reasonable to argue that the hostility should drag till we kick the turks out of this area

this isnt going to happen so the best would be to improve the relations between the two countries

a golden oportunity exists with cyprus

if things cant work there there isnt any possible way that could work between our nations

when it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides

what were you doing on anatolia after the ww anyway

do you think it was your right to be there

i always avoid to discuss such things

i consider it a waist of my time

besides as i said i do not want to open a new flame

i am not saying that conflicts started with that

it is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering

it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise

i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey

i thought it was a positive attempt to make the relations better

i thought it was a smart move to receive more money from greek tourists

i bet that this week there should be about  tourists from greece in turkey

each one will leave at least  so go and figure what this means to your economy

if you had kept the visa requirement how many greeks would bother to visit turkey

the greeks i mentioned who wouldnt talk to me are educated people

they have never met me but they know

i am bad person because i am from turkey

politics is not my business and it is not the business of most of the turks

when it comes to individuals why the hatred

come on

if this is your targetwellthat tells a lot about you

 can nick steel provide documentation for this alleged incident 

did you really think he is talking about something realistic

  harry

  you must be kidding this is not a single incident  now

this has become a daily life practice in gazza  if you mean the killing of children by armed soldiers

yeahwellsometimeswhen cowards put their children and wives in the front line so their enemy cannot do anythingwellmaybe in those casesyou have no better thing to do to save your life than shooting

and if parents want their children alivei think it would be better that before they get out to throw stonesmolotov botllesor when they come to kill solidersto keep their children in the houses

 if you are objecting the number of occupying israeli  soldiers terrorists or the way they do it  then  look in the dictionary at the word terrorism

it says nu the use of threats of violenceand violence esp for political purposes

it sounds more like your guys  i caan assure you that they do worse than that

just as yeah

welli guess you were in thereand you know it all  example  children were killed this month of ramadhan  two of them by military vehicules

an other similar  incident by vehicule was the one of  feb  ramadhan  where thee military truck on purpose hit a passenger  where from do you know that it was on purpose

personallyi didnt hear about this casealthough i dont deny itbut how can anybodybesides the person itselfcan say it was on purpose

 the   oldd raajij rouhy yeahsurethe truck driver looked in the car with his zionist equipment of detecting palestinian childrenand then he thought to himselfhey there is a  year and  weeks girls in the carwhy wont i make an accident and kill the enemy

maximum i will die too in the crashbut what do i care

   hakim

 actually if can remember correctly was it not reported and even on camera some time during the israeli invasion of lebanon or when the itifada began that cnn caught regular uniformed israeli soldiers breaking the arms of some arab youngsters in a very professional and brutal manner someone please give full details if they can remember

this is one of the few wellit was about  years ago in the intifada the fact that you cant remember the time prooves how much do you care about it

i do not think that what the soliders did was correct

but i will not agree that they were breaking their armsi saw that filmandunlike in the usait was broadcasted entirely not long ago in a talk show and at the end the armbroken guys got up and walked and used their arms very good

they guy who did it was interviewed and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take his ordersand spitted in his face

what ammount of truth exist in this statement i cannot tell youbecause i wasnt there

but the guy who did it was in prisonif it makes you any good

occassions on which such a scene has been transmitted to the west and in the usa  it caused uproar and was one of the factors that has significantly changed the preception of the israeli armys role in the mideast

noit didnt

the israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle eastit is still the only human armyas much as an army can be humanto any american who will claim the oppositei can only remember the cnn broadcasting of the american solider who beat a somalian boy

it was very cruel to seebut i wont say because of this that the american army is cruel

 so there is proof for you

it is obvious that is a systematic policy of the israelis which must be occurring on a massive scale behind the scenes

some kind of proof

in their names we demand justice

in april  the turkish government began a systematically executed depopulation of the eastern anatolian homeland of the armenians through a genocidal extermination

this genocide was to insure that turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the republic of turkey

the result 

million murdered  billion dollars of armenian property stolen and plundered

this genocide ended nearly  years of armenian civilization on those lands

today the turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior armenian existence on those lands

todays turkish governmental policy is to rewrite the history of the era to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the armenian people

in the face of refutation ad nauseam the turkish historical society and cronies shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred

this policy merely demonstrates that in the modern era genocide is an effective state policy when it remains unredressed and unpunished

a crime unpunished is a crime encouraged

adolf hitler took this cue less than  years after the successful genocide of the armenians

turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of armenians yet armenians were removed from every city town and village in the whole of turkey

armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as rebels

turkey claims there was no genocide of the armenians yetturkish population figures today show zero armenians in eastern turkey the armenian homeland

turkey claims armenians were always a small minority yetturkey claims armenians were a threat

in a final insult to the victims the republic of turkey sold the bones of approximately  murdered armenians for profit to europe

those who wish to learn something about the perversion of judaism should consult the masterly work by yehoshua harkabi who was many years the head of israeli intelligence and an opponent of the plo

his latest book was published in english and includes a very detailed analysis of judeonazism

you mean he talks about those jews who because of their self hatred spend all their time attacking judaism jews and israel using the most despicable of antisemetic stereotypes

i dont think we need to coin a term like jedeonazism to refer to those jews who in their endless desire to be accepted by the nazis do their dirty work for them

we can just call them house jews fools or antisemites from jewish families

i think house jews a reference to a person of jewish ancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that condemn judaism is perfectly sufficeint

i think a few years free of their antisemetic role models would do wonders for most of them

the study intends to determine which techniques if any have been used to teach music for the deaf

if you have any experience in music education for the deaf and would like to help me with this project your help would be very much appreciated

if you also want to exchange some ideas about the subject matter feel yourself welcome

i have been working in this area for a while in brazil  by the way i am brazilian  and also in us and i am very pleased with the results

i hope that this inquiry will not cause too many inconveniences

thank you for or time and consideration

other if you checked other please indicate your major  some school systems require music to be taught to deaf children other school systems have not thought of the possibility to teach music for children with hearing limitations

the following questionnaire was designed to find out how teachers face the issue of teaching or not teaching music for the deaf

also a part of this study is to determine teachers attitudes towards music programs for deaf children

directions read the following questions and circle the number that best describes your attitude towards music for deaf children left column and circle the appropriate yes no or not applicable whether you do the task right column

sd strongly disagree y yes dis disagree n no neu neutral na not applicable ag agree sa strongly agree sd dis neu ag sa competencies y n na       deaf children can be educated in y n na music

deaf children should have regular y n na music classes

a special music teacher must posses y n na an appropriate training in a variety of communication methods to use with deaf children

in preparing the lessons the teacher y n na must keep in mind that deaf children may present special needs in order to participate in musical activities

deaf and normal hearing children y n na should have music classes together



 of a succesful music experience y n na by a deaf child depends upon the teachers creativity and commitment with the subject matter

deaf children can learn to appreciate y n na music but they will never be a musician or a performer

deaf children are not able to y n na discriminate and recognize sounds

deaf children can not distinguish y n na among loud and soft sounds

deaf children can never match the y n na music in their head to a note on a musical instrument

the most appropriate material to y n na start music classes for the deaf would be the folk songs said he would be replaced by the military commandant of baku police majorgeneral abdullah allakhverdiyev

  the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks

the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some 

people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel

anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking hisher sources does not deserve to be believed

the gaza strip does not possess the highest population density in the world

in fact it isnt even close

just one example will serve to illustrate the folly of this statement the city of hong kong has nearly ten times the population of the gaza strip in a roughly comparable land area

the centers of numerous cities also possess comparable if not far higher population densities

examples include manhattan island ny city sao paolo ciudad de mexico bombay

could you please give me details about an event where a neutral observer was killed by purpose by an israeli soldier

actually im still trying to understand the selfjustifying rationale behind the recent murder of ian feinberg 

in gaza

hate to be simple minded about this tim but i think its really very simple

he was a dirty jew

and the only good jew in some peoples mind is a dead jew

thats what  years of propaganda that fails to discriminate between jew and zionist will do

thats what  years of statements like the ones ive appended will do to someones mind

they make people sick

they drag down political discourse to the point where killing your opponent is an honorable way to resolve a dispute

what else can come of such demagogery

in resyrias expansion the author writes that the un thought zionism was racism and that they were wrong

they were correct the first time zionism is racism and thankfully the mcgill daily the student newspaper at mcgill was proud enough to print an article saying so

if you want a copy send me mail

 steve  i know this paper well and see it for the exercise in selective morality and judgement it is

until such time as it recognizes that any religiously based government is racist exclusionary and simply built on a philosophy of separate but equal secondclass treatment of minorities it will continue to be known for its bias

if jewish nationalism is racism so is islam anywhere where people are allotted different rights according to race religion or culture is racist

there was no such letter in the chronicle on that date or at any other time

is this a figment of your imagination

here is another one source mitteilungsblatt berlin december  nr

and  yet another historical fact a fact that for years has been deliberately forgotten concealed and wiped from memory  the fact of armeniannazi collaboration

a magazine called mitteilungsblatt der deutscharmenischen gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration

the magazine was first published in berlin in  during nazi rule of germany and continued publication until the end of 

even the name of the magazine which implies a declaration of armeniannazi cooperation is attentiongetting

this magazine every issue of which proves the collaboration is historically important as documentary evidence

it is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind

in nazi germany armenians were considered to be an aryan race and certain political economic and social rights were thus granted to them

they occupied positions in public service and were partners in nazi practices

the whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered aryan and what befell them

is it true that israeli stocks nuclear weapons 

if so  could you provide any evidence 

yes israel has nuclear weapons

however  their use so far has been restricted to killing deer by lsd addicted cherrie soldiers

they are locked in the cellar of the garinei afula factory and since the gingi lost the key no one can use them anymore

even if the gingi finds the key the chief rabbis have a time lock on the bombs that does not allow them to be activated on the sabbath and during weeks which follow victories of the betar jerusalem soccer team

a quick glance at the national league score table will reveal the strategic importance of this fact

article  any destruction by the occupying power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons or to the state or to other public authorities or to social or cooperative organizations is prohibited except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations

ps it is obvious that violations of the above articles are also violations of the international convention of the rights of the child

 i have just started reading the articles in this news group

there seems to be an attempt by some members to quiet other members with scare tactics

apparently thats not the case with virginiaedu since you are still posting

alan h stein asteinisraelnysernetorg

 for your information on israel

since i read both american media and israeli media i can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the american press for knowledge about israel does not have a true picture of what is going on

of course you never read arab media i read arab israeli jer

post and this network is more than enough and western american french and british reports and i can say that if we give israel  and arabs  on the bias scale of course you can switch the polarities israeli newspapers will get either a  or  american leading newspapers and tv news range from  to  yes there are some that are more israelis than israelis the montreal suburban a local free newspaper probably is closer to kahanes views than some israeli right wing newspapers british range from  neutral to  french that iknow of of course range from  afrofrench magazines to  arab official media range from  to  egyptian to  in sa

why no 

because they do not want to overdo it and stir people against israel and therefore against them since they are doing nothing

 as to the claim that israeli papers are biased of course they are

some may lean to the right or the left just like the media here in america

but they still report events about which people here know nothing

i choose to form my opinions about israel and the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average american who relies exclusively on an american media which does not report on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy

the average bias of what you read would be probably around  while that of the average american would be the same if they do not read or read the newyork times and similar newsmakers and  if they read some other relatively less biased newspapers

so you are not better off

 it seems that president clinton can recognize jerusalem as israels capitol  while still keeping his diplomatic rear door open by stating that the parties  concerned should decide the citys final status

even as i endorse clintons vie  w of course it is definitely a matter to be decided upon by israel and  other participating neighboring contries

 i see no real conflict in stating both views nor expect any better from  politicians

   david shalhevet  dshalvmdcsouiucedu  university of illinois  dept anim sci   pabl   w gregory dr  urbana il  i was trying to avoid a discussion of the whether clintons views should be endorsed or not

all i was trying to find out was whether the newspaper article was correct in making these statements about the president by obtaining some information about when and where he made these statements

dec

leading israeli author and cultural commentator ab

yehoshua launched a ferocious attack on diaspora jewry at a zionist youth council meeting in north london last week

the diaspora he claimed was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the jewish people

he was scathing about its failure to act before the holocaust

he said the diasporas religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the s and had fiercely opposed zionism

consequently he considered the holocaust the failure of judaism

his talk entitled diaspora a neurotic solution covered  years of jewish history

mr yehoshuas other targets included soviet jews who were he said not staying in israel but running away and all jews outside israel who were using other peoples countries like hotels

the only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral because it looked to israel for its identity but lived elsewhere

worse it threatened israel itself creating a distraction for her citizens who were leaving by the thousands

mr yehoshua who described himself as a soldier for aliyah ended by calling for the creation of a new total jew living in israel

earlier speaking at a meeting of jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in israeli literature mr yehoshua claimed that israeli writers were paralyzed by the countrys political situation

he said israels wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration

today israeli writers avoided writing directly about the arabisraeli conflict

no major work had been produced about the intifada

instead writers were tackling themes such as jewish identity emigration from israel and personal and family issues

mr yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the israeli political situation

he could no longer step into an israeli arabs shoes and portray him as a real flesh and blood character

he claimed that after  years of statehood the problem of israeli identity had not been solved

he said jews remained too preoccupied with the borders of identity between jew and nonjew and were not concerned with the nature of that identity

jewish values in israel embraced every aspect of daily life unlike in the diaspora where jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in he said

he warned that modern hebrew a unifying force for the jewish people would have to struggle for its future especially in literary circles

it faced fierce competition from the english language

 yeah too much mutluargic isnt helping

i could one day proceed and you shouldnt think many turks read mutluargic stuff

they are in my kill file likewise any other fanatic

 i have nothing against greeks but my problem is with fanatics

i have met  so many greeks who wouldnt even talk to me because i am turkish

from my  experience all my friends always were open to greeks   well the history wars current situations all of them do not help

well panos mr

tamamidis the way you put it it is only the turks who bear the responsibility of the things happening today

that is hard to believe for somebody trying to be objective

when it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides

what were you doing on anatolia after the ww anyway

do you think it was your right to be there

i am not saying that conflicts started with that

it is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering

it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise

i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey

i thought it was a positive attempt to make the relations better

the greeks i mentioned who wouldnt talk to me are educated people

they have never met me but they know

i am bad person because i am from turkey

politics is not my business and it is not the business of most of the turks

when it comes to individuals why the hatred

so that makes me think that there is some kind of brainwashing going on in greece

after all why would an educated person treat every person from a nation the same way

can you tell me about your history books and things you learn about greekturkish encounters during your schooling

take it easy

 if you arabs wouldnt position guerilla bases in refugee camps artillery batteries atop apartment buildings and munitions dumps in hospitals maybe civilians wouldnt get killed

kinda like saddam hussein putting civilians in a military bunker

 ed

who is the you arabs here

since you are replying to my article you are assuming that i am an arab

well im not an arab but i think you are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said

the bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in lebanon by israel is very consistent with its policy of intimidation

that is the only policy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in the middle east

what the hell do you know about israeli policy

what gives you the fiat to look into the minds of israeli generals

has this policy of intimidation been published somewhere

for your information the actions taken by arabs specifically the plo were not uncommon in the lebanon campaign of 

my brain is full of shit

at least i dont look into the minds of others and make israeli policy for them

i was merley pointing out that the other side is also suffering

like i said im not an arab but if i was say a lebanese you bet i would defende my homeland against any invader by any means

yeah yeah yeah

we all suffer

its too bad that civilians get killed but i will blame their arab leaders who put them in positions of danger before i will blame the israelis

just like palestinians who send their children into warzones to throw rocks at armed israeli soldiers

what irresponsible parents

as golda meir said peace will only come when the arabs start loving their children more than they hate the jews

she fell down it was   muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from   their balconies told us they seized her by the hair   and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the   mortgage bank thats a good block and a half or two   from here

i know this for sure because i saw it   myself

sumgait azerbaijan i hadnt lived very long in sumgait only eight years

i moved there from novosibirsk

my son entered the baku nautical school and so i transferred to azerbaijan

later i met someone and married him and now my name is arutunian my husbands name 





that there would be a massacre was not discussed openly but there were hints and gibes so to speak at the armenian people and they were mocking the russians too

i was constantly aware of it at work and not just this past year

i couldnt find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because i ill just say it couldnt steal couldnt deceive and couldnt be involved in bribetaking

and when i asked for decent working conditions they told me leave dont keep the others from working you arent cut out for this kind of work

and at work and around all the time i would hear gibes at the armenians like the turks had it right they killed them allthe way theyve multiplied here theyre making it hard for us to live and things will be just fine if we get rid of them all

no problem the turks will help they say if we ask them theyll rid armenia of armenians in half an hour

well thats the way it all was but i never thought of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just couldnt imagine it

here weve been living under the soviet government for  years and no one even considered such an idea possible

but i had been forming my own opinions and in the presence of authoritative people i would often ask where is this all leading do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here

the russians are fleeing sumgait there are very few of them left

why is no one dealing with this whats going on

and when it all happened on the th and th it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone because what else are you to make of it if the first secretary of the city party committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an azerbaijani flag

i wouldnt be saying this now if i hadnt received personal confirmation from him later

because when we were under guard in the sk club on the st he came to the club that muslimzade

the women told me there he is there he is thats muslimzade

i didnt believe the rumors that he had carried an azerbaijani flag

i thought that they were just false rumors

i went over to him and said are you the first secretary of our city party committee

he answers me yes

and i ask him tell me did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an azerbaijani flag and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs i dont know exactly what they said but there was mention of armenian blood

and he tells me yes i was there but i tried to dissuade them from it

then i asked him another question and where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us

and he said i 



we didnt know what to do we didnt know we didnt anticipate that that would happen in sumgait

comrade mamedov the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr answered the same question for me no we actually didnt anticipate the slaughter in sumgait

at that time we were trying to contain the crowd of  in baku that was preparing for a massacre

those are his exact words the ones he said in the office of the council of ministers of the armenian ssr

and now about the events themselves

of course its painful to discuss them because it may seem that its not true to someone else

various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds some are true others arent

but unfortunately there are more true ones than false because it was so horrible in our age here in the space age the age of science the age of progress i dont know if someone had told me this story if i were living in or around moscow i wouldnt have believed it

why not

because it was really a genocide it was a massacre

thats genuinely what it was

for example on that day the thi didnt know about the th because my husband and i were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bedon the th our neighbor comes to our place and says youre in bed

you dont know anything about it

there was a demonstration in town and after it they were overturning armenian cars and burning them

they were looking into cars and asking are you an armenian

if they answered in armenian then they turned the car over and burned it

this isnt made up the wife of the senior investigator of the baku ministry of internal affairs told us

he was returning home from his dacha with his wife raisa sevastyanova shes my neighbor

she immediately came and told lis that they had landed right in the middle of it i dont know what to call it the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping

he answered in azerbaijani they let them go but they made him honk the horn they were kicking up a fracas

we didnt even believe it and i said certainly that didnt happen how can that be

and she said muslimzade was leading the crowd and the sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are armenians

and when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store he said dont break the shop windows dont destroy state property but do whatever else you want

i didnt hear this with my own two ears but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing armenians although hes an azerbaijani

while we were talking all of a sudden right across from us 





sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say look theres a crowd out there

and sure enough when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building

there was an armenian family there a woman and two girls

they lived across from us

im sorry i dont know the building number or the peoples names since we were in my husbands apartment in microdistrict  and i lived in microdistrict no



there was awful looting going on there at the time the most hideous things were going on there then

one building there ours was attacked twice once wasnt enough for them

they returned to the places where they hadnt finished the armenians off

if an azerbaijani family dared to conceal armenians they beat the azerbaijanis too

they also beat russians if it was russians doing the hiding

because there were russians among them they said so on television there were people of various nationalities

but they didnt tell us why there were people of different nationalities

because they wouldnt have touched the azerbaijanis if they hadnt dared to stick up for the armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes

at the time i saw this from the window i was there sevastyanova was there and so was my husband

we went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony

all kinds of things even a sofa

then when it was all down there they burned it up

then we saw the crowd and they were all oohing

at first i couldnt figure out what was happening

and later i told my husband lendrush l think theyre beating someone out there

and he answered i dont know could be

suddenly the crowd separated for a moment and i saw it and raisa sevastyanova saw it too

my husband had turned the other way he didnt see it

i saw a naked girl with her hair down

they were dragging her

she kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her

she fell down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank thats a good block and a half or two from here

i know this for sure because i saw it myself

then the crowd rushed toward our building

we were standing there and you can of course imagine what we were feeling

were they going to kill us or not

and i also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman because i had just seen that

i asked my husband

i gave him an axe and said you kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse

but our neighbors its true defended us they said there arent any armenians in our entryway go away only muslims live here

disaster missed us that time

but at two oclock in the morning a crowd of about  people approximately came back to our place

my husband was already asleep

he can sleep when hes upset about something but i cant

i was standing running from balcony to balcony

our power was out i dont remember for how long but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off

there were no lights whatsoever and i was glad of course

i thought it was better that way

but then i look and the crowd is at our balcony

this was at  in the morning

the first time they were at our building it was  and now it was  in the morning

but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor the azerbaijani was awake and watching out there were human beings among them too

so she goes out with a pail of garbage as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two oclock in the morning

she used it as a pretext and went toward those young people

they really were youngsters

from my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young azerbaijani boys

they spoke azerbaijani

and when they came up to her she said what do you want

and they answered we want the armenian family that lives here pointing toward the second floor with their hands

she says i already told you we dont have any armenians here now leave do you hear this is an old muslim woman talking to you and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away

and so they seemed to listen to her

they were all very young they started apologizing and left

that was the second time death was at our door

i forgot to mention about one other apartment a man named rubik lives there i dont know him really i knew his daughter i mean i saw her around but we really didnt know them

but i do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to chernobyl and worked there for eight months to earn money

can you imagine what that means

he risked his life to earn x amount of money in order to better his family

he bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughters hand in marriage but alas everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels

they threw everything out the windows and the rest we saw from our balcony how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadnt already been smashed or taken

what is one to think of that

it means that the parents in those families were in on it too

unfortunately i came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance both the beating of the armenians and the stripping of apartments

something on the order of well move the armenians out and take over their apartments

i have worked honestly my whole life you can check everything about me

i came as a patriot from china waited for nights on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr i came to my homeland as a patriot because i knew that the party and the komsomol were holy things

but when i saw in sumgait that there wasnt anything holy about them that party membership was bought that komsomol members joined only for personal gain that there were no ideals no ideas god save me everything was being bought and sold i saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did

i cant talk any more about it 





the image of that beating 





when i went out of my own apartmentthey picked us up under soviet army guard they had arrived from all over to suppress that gangnot only armenians but some russian families and their children too came out of their apartments and joined us because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was

and whats interesting is that when we left on the buses i rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the armenians would somehow understand the injustice of what was done

but having analyzed and weighed the whole thing once i calmed down having thought it all through i came to a conclusion that is shared by many people

if a lot of azerbaijanis didnt want their armenian neighbors to be killed and that basically depended on that muslimzadehe said that he had wanted to calm them downthen is it possible that he didnt have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute go and announce it on television citizens of sumgait

take what you can into your hands lets protect our neighbors from this massacre

those crowds werent such that there was no controlling them

basically they were unarmed

they didnt have firearms mostly they had knives they had all kinds of metal parts like armature shafts sharpened at the ends special rocks different to a degree that we noticed them there arent rocks like those in sumgait soils they were brought from somewhere as though it were all specially planned

so as i was saying i weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us why wasnt it arranged

it means that the government didnt want to do it

when the crowd was moving from the city party committee to the sputnik what there was no way of informing baku

no there was no way it turns out

the crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict

i wont mention the things i didnt see myself ill only talk about the things i myself witnessed

they were in microdistrict  beginning at  oclock in the evening when i saw them from the other building and they were somewhere else until midnight or one oclock in the morning because at  they came back to our building

they hadnt completely finished making their predatory rounds of microdistrict 

when they returned to our building i told my husband lendrush now the police are probably going to come my god now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid

well alas no there were to be no authorities not a single policeman not a single fireman not a single ambulance came while they were raging as it turns out as we later found out beginning on the might of the th

there were dead people ruined apartments and burned autos one car near the bus station it was burned and overturned it was probably there about four days everyone saw it and what went on in block 

those who live there know they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses how they beat those poor unarmed soldiers and how on that square i cant remember the name of it where there is that fork coming from the bus station that intersection now im upset and i cant think of the name 





theres a tall building there a story and from the balconies there people saw that butchery when the poor soldiers wearing only helmets with shields and those unfortunate clubs moved against that mob

and when they fell those to yearold boys ran up and using stones big heavy stones beat them to death on their heads

who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government

the upshot is that this republic has not been under soviet control for a long time but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved

if you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that i tell the truth ive been struggling for truth for five years there already the five years that i worked at the azerbaijani railroad

some people there considered me a demagogue others who knows what some think im an adventure seeker and some a prankster

but i wanted everything to be right i would become outraged how can this be why is it people treat one another this way on a soviet railroad as though the azerbaijani railroad were azerbaijani property or the property of some magnate or some mafia if i want to ill get you out of here if i want to ill get rid of you if i want to ill do something else

and theres a black market price for everything in the most brazen way a coach to moscow costs so much a coach on a local train costs so much

once when i was complaining to the head of the conductors pool he had the nerve to tell me maybe you wont even believe this but this im afraid i heard with my own ears tatyana just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect

youre alone against everyone so instead why dont you give more money to the chief conductor and everything will go fine for you

i started to cry turned and left

what else could i do where else could i go to complain

i realized that everything was useless

and the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it

i filed a written complaint and they ground it into dust they destroyed it i still have a copy but whats the use

when the general procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody sumgait affair in addition to the information about what i saw what i was a witness to i gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad

they accepted my petition but i dont know if theyre going to pursue it or not

because youll excuse me i no longer believe in the things i aspired to the things i believed in before its all dead

they just spit on my soul stomped on everything physically and most important spiritually because you can lose belongings thats nonsense that all comes with time but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in youyour beliefsare destroyed it can be very difficult to restore them

i want to tell of one incident

i just dont know at the time i was in such a state that i didnt even take minor things into account

here is an example

of course its not a minor one

my neighbor raisa sevastyanova she has a son valery who is in the th grade in a school in microdistrict 

a boy vitaly danielian i dont know his last name goes to school with him or rather went to school with him

i was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to moscow 





oh yes and theres one important detail when the massacre began for two to three hours the phones werent working in armenian apartments and later in several russian and azerbaijani apartments

but the fact of the matter is that service was shut off you could not call anywhere

why

again it means it was all planned

how come service is cut off for no reason

and the lights went off

and those brats were raging as they liked they werent afraid they ran about freely they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them

they knew it

now im going to tell about the incident

so this little vitaly vitalik an armenian boy went to school with valery they were in the same class

according to what valery and his neighbor pal saidat the time i was in the same apartment as they were i sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put througha mob attacked the building where vitalik lived

so valery ran to his mother and said mamma please let me go to vitaliks what if they kill him

maybe hes still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow







hes a nice guy we all like him hes a good person hes smart

his mother wouldnt let him go

in tears she says valery you cant go because i am afraid

he says mamma we can get around the crowd

well just watch just have a look

they made it through

i dont know i think vitaliks parents lived in microdistrict no

 and when they got there they made a superficial deduction

knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere that you could see from the street which were the armenian apartments in the building they went here and there and looked and saw that the windows were intact and so they calmed down

but even though the windows in that apartment were not broken everything inside was totally smashed and vitalik lay there with a broken skull and his mother and father had already been murdered

little vitalik didnt even know they were dead

so two weeks ago i dont know he was in critical condition no maybe it was longer we left sumgait on march  spent some time in moscow and then we came to yerevan

so its been about a month already its so hard to keep all this straight

so valery the next day when he found out that vitaliks family has been killed and vitalik was ling in the semashko hospital in baku valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him

but they wouldnt admit them telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma

they cried and left having also found out that the girl i saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too

as it turns out she was brought there in serious condition but at least she was alive at the time 





when we got to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not if those friends were alive or not 





and when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived

when you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end

if you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book

a book of things it is even difficult to believe

and those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue the ones at the sk they know im not lying that girlfriend came up to one of them and said what happened

and she bared her breasts and they were completely covered in cigarette burns 





those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts

after something like that i dont know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it

now 





when we stayed at the military unit for a while they provided well basic conditions for us there

the military unit is located in nasosny some six miles from sumgait

and living there we met with a larger group of people

there were about  people at the unit

you know there was a point when i couldnt even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you

and when you hear the false rumors 





yes by the way false rumors were spread in sumgait saying that the armenians around yerevan had destroyed azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers

i didnt know whether to believe it or not

and people who dont know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge

but when i arrived in armenia and was in spitak and in spitak all those villages are not only intact but at that time had even been protected just in case they were guarded they got better food than did the inhabitants of spitak

not a single person there died and no one is planning to harm them

around yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed and the armenians didnt attack anyone

but actually after an evil of the magnitude suffered in sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness but no one acted on it

and i dont know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the armenians are guilty that it is they who organized it

rumors like that are being spread in azerbaijan

and if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it they not only perceive it with their minds but with their hearts too

to them it seems that the older person is telling the truth

for example one says did you know that out of  people killed by the way originally they said  people but later they found a nd  were azerbaijani and one was an armenian

of course im upset but its utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset

sometimes l forget things but i know i want to return to the time when we were in the sk club across from the city party committee

when i saw muslimzade in the sk club building i went to him to ask because i couldnt believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner

i already mentioned this and if i repeat anything please excuse me

i asked him why did you do that and why are you here now why did you come here

to laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor

the overcrowding there was tremendous it was completely unsanitary and several of the children were already sick

its true the troops tried to make it livable for us

they cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere

plus they were never given any direct orders they didnt know what they were authorized to do and not to do

and it was only on march  at five oclock in the evening that krayev himself the lieutenant general the city commandant of sumgait was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do as his heart advised him and relocate people to the military unit

but thats not what i want to talk about now

muslimzade characteristically tried to get me out of the sk building and take me to the city party committee which is across the square from the club

he took me by the hand and said citizen dont worry well go and have a talk in my office

i told him no after everything youve done i dont believe one iota of what you say

if i go to the city party committee ill disappear and the traces of me will disappear too

because you cant stand it when 





oh yes and there was another interesting detail from that meeting

it was even very funny although at the time i wasnt up to laughing

he was in a nice expensive hat and so as to put him to shame so to speak i said oh why did you come here all duded up like a london dandy you smell of good perfume youre in your starched shirt and you have your expensive hat on

you came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor who are already getting sick whose relatives have died

did you come to laugh at them

and the one who was accompanying him an azerbaijani i dont know who he was or what his title was he quickly snatched the hat off muslimzades head and hid it

then i said my god

were not marauders

were not you

we didnt come to you with the intention of stealing

well kill me kill me

muslimzade says to me but im not guilty 





kill me kill me but im not guilty

and i say ok fine youre not guilty have it your way

but give us an answer were asking you where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women when they were killing the children burning things carrying on outrageously and wrecking all those apartments

where were you then

you know we didnt expect it we did not know what to do we didnt anticipate that something like that would happen in sumgait

i started laughing and said its truly funny

he says what could i do

we didnt know what to do

and i say im sorry but itll be ridiculous if i tell you the first secretary of the city party committee shouldnt march out in front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body

thats what you should have done

thats the way it was during the war

not a single party committee secretary compromised himself either he died or he led people into battle

and what did you do

you ran away you left you hid you marched with a flag because you were afraid excuse my language you feared for your own damned hide

and when we ask you you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done

thats right i told him the city party committee got confused all the party committees got confused the police got confused

baku got confused they all lay in a faint for two weeks and the gang ran the show with impunity

and if it werent for the troops it wouldnt have been just two days there wouldnt be a single armenian left in sumgait for sure they would have finished their bloody affair because they brazenly went up to some russians too the ones who tried to say something to them and they told them as soon as we finish with the armenians well come after you too

and by the way there was a colonel who took us to the military unit

he was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the sk and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit

we asked him what

how

what will come of us

he openly said you know for us the main thing now is to catch that gang

well finish that quickly

youll stay at the military unit for the time being and well decide later

the general procuracy of the ussr arrived it consists of investigators from all cities

there were some from stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because the affair was truly frightful

about this by the way comrade katusev spoke as everyone knows hes the first deputy general procurator of the ussr

when he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit by the way he told us the honest truth because he couldnt not say it because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen and he said there was afghanistan and it was bad but sumgaitits horrible

and the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished in accordance with our laws

and thats a quote

then one mother throws herself at himher two sons had died before her very eyesand says who will return my sons

who is going to punish the culprits

they tried to calm her down and he said in order for us to conduct a proper investigation in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility you must help us because we dont know maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes and maybe the neighbors know maybe someone saw something

dont be afraid write about it in detail

so that youre not afraid 





everyone knows that many of you are afraid having lived through such horrors they think that if they write the whole truth about lets say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge later

were going to do it like this were going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there

we dont need to know who wrote it

the names of the people who write wont be made public but we need all the information

let each and every one not be afraid let each write what is necessary who they saw in that gang who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the armenians 





you must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn

two soldiers and a major guarded the urn

and sure enough many people people who didnt even want to write 



i know one woman who asked me she came up and said you as a russian the same thing wont happen to you as will happen to me

so please 





ill give you the information and you please write it down for me

so she was afraid and there were a lot like her 





but later after katusev made his speech she sat and wrote down everything she knew

and we threw it all into the urn

now we dont know if it will be of any use

for a factual picture will emerge from all that information

one person can lie but thousands cant lie thousands simply cant lie

you have to agree with that a fact is a fact

why for example should someone say that black is white if it is really black

the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr mamedov as i said was in yerevan

my husband and i were at the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov was present the one who had come to convince the people of sumgait to return to their previous dwellings to their old apartments

we asked for a meeting with him and it was granted

when we went to see him he tried to behave properly very politely delicately but 





when the truth was told right to his face and when i asked him some of the same questions i had asked muslimzade where were you personally when they were beating us

now youre trying to convince us to return why didnt you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading

he says youre telling the truth

lets not mince words

youve told me right to my face and ill tell you straight

ill tell you the pure truth

i was gotten out of bed in the evening the whole government was up including me and we were restraining a crowd of about  in baku

but we never expected that in a city like sumgait with its fine international record such a thing could happen

we expected it in baku

i say so that means you expected it all the same

why were you expecting it

and he says you know it just happened that way

we were expecting it in baku we were trying to restrain it but in sumgait 





i say fine you didnt know for the first three or four hours but then you should have known

why did no one help us

and he says well ok we didnt know what to do and things like that

basically it was the same story i got from muslimzade

later when he said you go on back the situation in sumgait is favorable now everything is fine the armenians are friendly with the azerbaijanis 





to this l answered you know what 





im speaking with you as a member of a neutral nation 





i have never argued with armenians or with azerbaijanis and i was an eyewitness 





you tell me please comrade mamedov  i asked him what would you say about this honestly if you were being completely frank with us

then he said yes i admit that i am honestly ashamed shame on the entire azerbaijani nation we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire soviet union but before the whole world

because now the voice of america and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors too

and i say theres nothing to add to what really happened

i dont think its possible to add anything more awful

he says yes i agree with you i understand your pain it is truly an unfortunate occurrence

i repeat that he said unfortunate occurrence

and then he suddenly remembered himself what he was sayinghe had a pen in his hands he was fidgeting with it nervously and said oh excuse me a tragedy really 





i take this to mean that he really thinks its an unfortunate occurrence

and of course he says i understand that having gone through all this you cant return to sumgait but its necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried

and he even gave a detail which i dont know if it matters or not that  policemen were being tried

specifically in relation to that bloody affair

yes by the way there is another good detail how i was set up at work in baku after the events

i went to an undergarment plant there was an azerbaijani working there and suddenly she tells me what they didnt nail your husband

they screwed up

i was floored i hadnt imagined that anyone in baku too could say something like that

well after that i went up to see 





to my office i needed to find out about those days what was going to happen with them how they were going to put down those days from february  to march  





and the administrator told me i dont know tatyana go to the head of the conductors pool

be grateful if they dont put it down as unexcused absence

i was really discouraged by this

they all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived and here theyre telling me that i was skipping work as though i was off enjoying myself somewhere

i went to the office of the chief of the pool his last name is rasulov and hes had that position for many years

incidentally hes a party member and is a big man in town

and suddenly when i went to him and said comrade rasulov this is the way it was 





he looked at me askance and said and why are youhe knows me by my previous last namewhy did you get wrapped up in this mess

i say what do you mean why did i get wrapped up in this mess

my husbands an armenian i tell him i have an armenian last name

and he screwed up his face made a kind of a grimace as though he had eaten something sour and said i didnt expect that you would 





what did he mean by that

and how should he behave the chief of the pool a man who supervises  workers

now its true there was a reduction but for sure there are still  conductors working for him

and if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that then what can you expect from a simple uneducated politically unsophisticated person

hes going to believe any and all rumors that the armenians are like this the armenians are like that and so on 





by the way that mamedovnow im going back to mamedovs office when i asked him are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to sumgait

he answered yes you know i would guarantee them 





i dont want to take on too much i would guarantee them firmly for  years

but i wont guarantee them for longer than  years

i say so youve got another thing like that planned for  years from now

so theyll be quiet and then in another  years itll happen again

i couldnt contain myself any more and i also told him and how did it get to that point certainly you knew about it how they were treating the russians for example in baku and in sumgait how they were hounded from their jobs

certainly you received complaints i wrote some myself

why did no one respond to them

why did everyone ignore what was going on

didnt you prepare people for this by the way you treated them

and he says you know youre finally starting to insult me

he threw his pen on the desk

maybe now youll say im a scoundrel too

i say you know im not talking about you because i dont know

but about the ones who i do know i can say with conviction yes that comrade was involved in this that and that because i know for certain

well anyway he assured us that here in yerevan there were false rumors that  sumgait armenians were here and  were in sumgait and had gotten back to work

everyone was working he said and life was very good

we drove about the town ourselves comrade arutiunian first secretary of the communist party of armenia ssr came from the council of ministers of armenian he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in sumgait

when i asked mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said  well i walked down the street

and i said walking down the street in any city even if i were to go to new york i would never understand the situation because i would be a guest i dont have any contact with people but if you spend  days among some bluecollar workers in such a way that they didnt know you were the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers youd hear something quite different

i told him for example that i drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments

they took us all in turns to pick things up since people had fled to the military unit they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible

how are the neighbors in the microdistrict how will they view us what do they think

i thought maybe that in fact it wasnt something general of a mass nature some antinational something

and when that bus took us to our building because it was the same bus while we were going up to our apartment an armed soldier accompanied us

what does that say

it speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us going from apartment to apartment

and in fact especially with the young people you could sense the delight at our misfortune the grins and they were making comments too

and that was in the presence of troops when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by

and if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether

there will be more outrages of course perhaps not organized but in the alleys 





april   yerevan    reference     the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan volume i eyewitness accounts edited by samuel shahmuradian forward by yelena bonner  published by aristide d caratzas ny pages   david davidian dbdurartusdpaorg  how do we explain turkish troops on sdpa

do it

depew has shown himself to be unrepentant though embarrassed and still possessed of the same fuckedup hubrisladen selfrighteousness that the theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminalnazi armenians of the asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle

now try dealing with the rest of what i wrote

what is more the activities of the armenian government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race the turks or aimed at carrying out a onesided feud instead of being a struggle for liberation

from the outset the efforts of the armenian revolutionaries within the ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder cruelty and genocide so that no other interpretation of them is possible

armenian activities started during the reign of abdulhamid ii as individual acts of terror and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks

the element of brute force in these activities increased steadily culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the first world war

furthermore when the ottoman army withdrew from eastern anatolia after the  sarikamis defeat armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area

although the russians occupied eastern anatolia as an enemy nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war

however when they returned to their country in  after the revolution armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the ottoman forces returned to erzurum in 

during this period armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents

 for example let us look at a report dated  march  which the commander of the third army submitted when he entered erzurum and erzincan they were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by armenians even the trees were cut down and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word

as for the people who had been living in erzurum and erzincan those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated

when the russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act

a very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to

including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirty thousand in erzurum

all the fields in erzincan and erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation

at the present time the people are subsisting on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area

 foreign observers who witnessed the events including russian officers who did not desert their lines submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war

what is most important is that they stated in their reports the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned

 at the end of the war the german author dr weiss his austrian colleague dr stein and his turkish colleague mr ahmet vefik visited trabzon kars erzurum and batum between april th and may th  to record the cruelties

their writings not only show the scope of armenian activities but also reveal their goal and true nature

from melonsvnetibmcom mike magil subject re israel does not kill reporters

lines    anas omran has claimed that the israelis used to arrest and sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters

the assertion by anas omran is of course a total fabrication

if there is an once of truth iin it im sure anas omran can document such a sad and despicable event

otherwise we may assume that it is another piece of antiisrael bullshit posted by someone whose family does not know how to teach their children to tell the truth

if omran would care to retract this error i would be glad to retract the accusation that he is a liar

if he can document such a claim i would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar

failing to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is

why retract your accusation that hes a liar

if omran retracts his verbal diarrohea doesnt that only prove the liar he really is

a retraction would be pointless

giving this guy the opportunity to save face after uttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again

i must say that your style is very impressive mark

keep it up

from center for policy research cprigcapcorg subject hr

violations by israelarab st nfid ncdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  many of you ask me whether i approve of severe human rights violations by arab states becuse i focus on israeli human rights violations

lets make things clear my opposition to hr

violations in arab states is total and without qualification

no arab state is and can claim to be democratic

no arab state claims to be democratic

i am born in palestine now israel

i have family there

the lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life

i am concerned by palestine israel because i want peace to come to it

peace and justice

if anybody has legitimate claims towards arab states he should present his claims and ask for support

jews who left arab states are fully entitled to make claims and should do so if they consider their case has a merit

it is their basic right to return to these countries if they wish

if not they should not complain and compare themselves to the palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since israel was established and whose right is upheld by the united nations quasi totally

if jews feel discriminated in arab countries they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support

human rights violations by arab states dont justify legitimate nor are the cause for israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts

israeli breaches stem from the zionist concept which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to palestinians

israeli trights and palestinian rights are not symmetrical

the first party has a state and the other has none

the first is an occupier and the second the occupied

for any meaningful relationship to emerge some symmetry must be established

as long as israelis and jews dont realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the palestinian people and as long as israelis and jews dont want to exorcise their own past towards the palestinians the naqba of  etc

and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of israel was dependent upon the removal of most palestinian arabs there will be no base for a real trust

when i read the first time the list of the  arab villages destroyed by the state of israel in and after  i got a shock

i hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution

from anwarcscmuedu anwar mohammed subject lawsuit against adl nntppostinghost gsspcscmuedu organization school of computer science carnegie mellon lines  it looks like yigal has been busy rtw   jewish group sued for passing official information by adrian croft san francisco april  reuter  nineteen people including the son of former israeli defence minister moshe arens sued the antidefamation league adl on wednesday accusing the jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them

richard hirschhaut director of the san francisco branch of the adl art dealer roy bullock and former policeman tom gerard were also named as defendants in the suit filed in san francisco county superior court

the  accuse the adl of bnai brith a group dedicated to fighting antisemitism and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them including data from state and federal agencies

the suit alleges they disclosed the information to others including the governments of israel and south africa in what it alleges was a a massive spying operation

the action is a classaction suit

it was filed on behalf of about  antiapartheid activists or opponents of israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the adl bullock and gerard gathered information

representatives of the adl in san francisco were not immediately available for comment on wednesday

the civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that gerard a former inspector in the san francisco police intelligence unit passed confidential police files on california political activists to a spy ring

the fbi and san francisco police are investigating the adl bullock and gerard over the affair and last week searched the adls offices in san francisco and los angeles

the suit alleges invasion of privacy under the civil code of california which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources

it seeks exemplary damages of at least  per person as well as other unspecified damages

lawyer pete mccloskey a former congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs said the  plaintiffs included arabamericans and jews  and his wife helen who also had information gathered about her

one of the plaintiffs is yigal arens a research scientist at the university of southern california who is a son of the former israeli defence minister

arens told the san francisco examiner he had seen a file the adl kept on him in the s presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of palestinians and his position on the israelioccupied territories

according to court documents released last week bullock and gerard both kept information on thousands of california political activists

in the documents a police investigator said he believed the adl paid bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and bullock received confidential information from the authorities

no criminal charges have yet been filed in the case

the adl bullock and gerard have all denied any wrongdoing

all rights reserved

by catalina ortiz associated press writer san francisco ap  arabamericans and critics of israel sued the antidefamation league on wednesday saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network

the adl a national group dedicated to fighting antisemitism intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views according to the classaction lawsuit filed in san francisco superior court

none of us has been guilty of racism or nazism or antisemitism or hate crimes or any of the other isms that the adl claims to protect against

none of us is violent or criminal in any way said carol elshaieb an education consultant who develops programs on arab culture

the  plaintiffs include yigal arens son of former israel defense minister moshe arens

the younger arens a research scientist at the university of southern california said the adl kept a file on him in the s presumably because he has criticized israels treatment of palestinians

the adl believes that anyone who is an arab american  or speaks politically against israel is at least a closet antisemite arens said

the adl has denied any wrongdoing but couldnt comment on the lawsuit because it hasnt reviewed it said a spokesman at the adls new york headquarters

the fbi and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the adl spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups including white supremacist and antisemitic organizations arabamericans greenpeace the national association for the advancement of colored people and san francisco public television station kqed

some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit

no charges have been filed in the criminal investigation

the lawsuit accuses the adl of violating californias privacy law which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information not otherwise public from state or federal records

the lawsuit claims the adl disclosed the information to persons and entities who had no compelling need to receive it

it didnt elaborate

defendants include richard hirschhaut director of the adls office in san francisco

he did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment

other defendants are san francisco art dealer roy bullock an alleged adl informant over the past four decades and former police officer tom gerard

gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to bullock

gerard who has retired from the police force has moved to the philippines

bullocks lawyer richard breakstone said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it

upwe   adl sued for allegedly spying on us residents san francisco upi  a group of california residents filed suit wednesday charging the antidefamation league of bnai brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the israeli and south african governments

the classaction suit filed in san francisco superior court charges the adl and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information on outspoken opponents of israeli policies towards the occupied territories and south africas apartheid policy

the adl refused to comment on the suit

the suit also took aim at two top local adl officials and retired san francicso police officer tom gerard claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws

according to the suit gerard helped the adl obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers

information from these files were passed to the foreign governments the suit charges

the whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant said former rep pete mccloskey who is representing the plaintiffs

the adls informationgathering network was revealed publicly last week when the san francisco district attorneys office released documents indicating the group had spied on  people and  political and ethnic groups for more than  years

my understanding is that they the adl consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to israel or israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate said arens a research scientist at the university of southern california

the adl believes that anyone who is arab americanor speaks politically against israel is at least a closet antisemite

the fbi and the district attorneys office have been investigating the operation for four months

the  plaintiffs in the case include arens the son of former israeli defense minister moshe arens

in a press release the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them psychologically and economically and accused the adl of trying to interfere with their freedom of speech

  in article aprunocalcom stssdxbstunocalcom dorin baru writes    brad hernlem writes       well you should have noted that i was cheering an attack on an israeli   patrol inside lebanese territory while i was condemning the retaliatory   shelling of lebanese villages by israeli and israelibacked forces

my team   you see was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the   faces of the spectators in my teams viewing stands so to speak

    i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on   in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda

there are no a priori   black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in   retaliation to pinpoint attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the   lebanese terrorists

    if the attack was justified or not is at least debatable

but this is not the   issue

the issue is that you were cheering death

     dorin   dorin of all the criticism of my post expressed on tpm this one i accept

 i regret that aspect of my post

it is my hope that the occupation will end and  the accompanying loss of life but i believe that stiff resistance can help to  achieve that end

despite what some have said on tpm i think that there is  a point when losses are unacceptable

the strategy drove us troops out of  lebanon at least

  brad hernlem hernlemchessncsuedu hi brad i have two comments regarding your hope that the occupation will end belive that stiff resistanceetc

how about an untried approach ie peace and cooperation

i cant help but wonder what would happen if all violence against israelis stopped

hopefully violence against arabs would stop at the same time

if a state of nonviolence could be maintained perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved ie greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the territories

of course given the current leadership of israel your way may work also  but if that leadership changes eg to someone with ariel sharons mentality then i would predict a considerable loss of life ie no winners

secondly regarding your comment about the us troops responding to stiff resistance  the analogy is not quite valid

the us troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether

the israelis could not

just my 

worth no offense intended

from dbdurartusdpaorg david davidian subject re killer organization sdpa

ucsumassedu afs who wrote afs just a quick comment afs afs armenians killed turksturks killed armenians

afs afs simple as that

can anybody deny these facts

jews killed germans in wwii  germans killed jews in wwii but there was quite a difference in these two statements regardless of what nazi revisionists say

sy my grand parents were living partly in todays armenia and partly in sy todays georgia

there were villages kurdturk different turkic groups sy georgian muslimchristian armenian and farsi

very near to eachother

sy the people living there were aware of their differences

they were sy different people

for example my grandfather would not have been happy sy if his doughter had willed to marry an armenian guy

but that did not sy mean that they were willing to kill eachother

no

they were neighbors

ok sy armenians killed turks

which armenians

their neoghbors

as far as my sy grandparents are concerned the armenians attacked first but these sy armenians were not their neighbors

they came from other places

maybe sy first they had a training at some place

they were taught to kill people sy to hate turkskurds

it seems so

there is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the armenians of eastern turkey beginning in  with that of the armeno georgian conflicts of late 

the argument is not whether armenians ever killed in their collective existence but rather the wholesale destruction of anatolian armenians under orders of the turkish government

an armenian georgian dispute over the disposition of akhalkalak lori and pambak after the turkish third army evacuated the region cannot be equated with the extermination of anatolian armenians

many armenians and georgians died in this area in the scramble to reoccupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months

this is not the same as the turkish genocide of the armenians nearly four years earlier hundreds of kilometers away

sy anyway but after they killedraped turks and other muslim people sy around people assumed that armenians killed us raped our women sy not a particular group of people trained in some camps maybe backed sy by some powerful states after that step you cannot explain these sy people not to hate all armenians

i dont follow perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light

sy so what am i trying to point out

first at least for that region sy you cannot blame turkskurds etc since it was a self defense situation

sy most of the armenians i think are not to blame either

but since some sy people started that fire it is not easy to undo it

there are facts

sy people cannot trust eachother easily

it is very difficult to establish sy a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with sy different ethnicculturalreligious backgrounds but it is unfortunately sy very easy to start a fire

again the fighting between armenians and georgians in  had little to do with the destruction of the armenians in turkey

it is interesting that the georgian leaders of the transcaucasian federation armenia azerbaijan and georgia made special deals with turkish generals not to pass through tiflis on their way to baku in return for georgians not helping the armenians militarily

of course as turkish troops marched across what was left of caucasian armenia many armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the locals

this is in no comparison with events  years earlier in eastern anatolia

my fathers mothers family escaped cemiskezek  erzinka  erzerum  nakhitchevan  tiflis  constantinople  massachusetts

sy my grandparents were not bloodthirsty people

we did not experience sy what they had to endure

they had to leave their lands there were sy ladies old ladies all of her children killed while she forced to sy witness

young women put dirt at their face to make themselves sy unattractive

i dont want to go into any graphic detail

my grandmothers brother was forced to dress up as a kurdish women and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly

the turks would kill any armenian young man on sight in dersim

because their family was rather influential local kurds helped them escape before it was too late

this is why i am alive today

sy you may think that my sources are biased

they were biased in some sense

sy they experienced their own pain of course

that is the way it is

but sy as i said they were living in peace with their neighbors before

why sy should they become enemies

from center for policy research cprigcapcorg subject unconventional peace proposal nfid ncdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  from center for policy research cpr subject unconventional peace proposal a unconventional proposal for peace in the middleeast

by elias davidsson the following proposal is based on the following assumptions 

fundamental human rights such as the right to life to education to establish a family and have children to human dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc

are more important to human existence that the rights of states



in the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail



between the collectivities defining themselves as jewishisraeli and palestinianarab however labelled an unresolved conflict exists



this conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people

it moreover poisons relations between communities peoples and nations



each year the united states expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties



attempts to solve the israeliarab conflict by traditional political means have failed



as long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnicalreligious communitiespeoples which claim the land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible



love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice

when people love they share

having stated my assumptions i will now state my proposal



a fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is israelijew and the other palestinianarab



to be entitled for a grant a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to israeli citizenship under the law of return and the other partner although born in areas under current isreali control is not entitled to such citizenship under the law of return



for the first child the grant will amount to  for the second the third child 

for each child

for each subsequent child the grant will amount to 

for each child



the fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the israeliarab conflict including the us government jewish and christian organizations in the us and a great number of governments and international organizations



the emergence of a considerable number of mixed marriages in israelpalestine all of whom would have relatives on both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society

the existence of a strong mixed stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middleeast in a graceful manner

objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced

i will attempt to identify some of these 

the idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage is not conventional

however it is based on the concept of affirmative action which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination

international law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation



it may be objected that the israelipalestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle

this objection is based on the assumption that the enemy is not zionism as ideology and practice but israelijewish society and its members which will have to be defeated

this objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights see above 

fundamentalist jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage mixed marriages

from their point of view the continued existence of a specific jewish people overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of human rights

the president of the world jewish congress edgar bronfman reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to der spiegel a german magazine

he called the increasing assimilation of jews in the world a calamity comparable in its effects only with the holocaust

this objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions see above 

it may objected that only a few people in israelpalestine would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose

to this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal the existence of such a fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes



it may objected that such a fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes

this objection has merits

however it must be remembered that huge sums more than  billion are expended each year by the united states government and by us organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the middleeast through armaments

a mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of mixed marriages in israelpalestine thus encouraging the emergence of a nonsegregated society in that worntorn land

i would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment

it was gruesome

i suffered a   tremendous shock

there were about ten people there but the   doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being   taken to baku

there was a womans corpse there too she had   been 





well there was part of a body there 





a   hackedoff part of a womans body

it was something terrible

    deposition of roman aleksandrovich gambarian born  senior engineer sumgait automotive transport production association resident at building b apartment  microdistrict no

sumgait azerbaijan what happened in sumgait was a great tragedy an awful tragedy for us the armenian people and for all of mankind

a genocide of armenians took place during peacetime

and it was a great tragedy for me personally because i lost my father in those days

he was still young

born in 

on that day february  we were at home

of course we had heard that there was unrest in town my younger brother aleksandr had told us about it

but we didnt think 





we thought that everything would happen outdoors that they wouldnt go into peoples apartments

about five oclock we saw a large crowd near the kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict

we were sitting at home watching television

we go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into mir street

this is right near downtown next to the airline ticket office our house is right nearby

that day there was a group of policeman with shields there

they threw rocks at those policemen

then they moved off in the direction of our building

they burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for armenians to come out of the building

we switched off the light

as it turns out their signal was just the opposite to turn on the light

that meant that it was an azerbaijani home

we of course didnt know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment

suddenly theres pounding on the door

we go to the door all four of us there were four of us in the apartment

father mother my younger brother aleksandr and i

he was born in 

my father was a veteran of world war ii and had fought in china and in the soviet far east he was a pilot

we went to the door and they started pounding on it harder breaking it down with axes

we start to talk to them in azerbaijani whats going on

whats happened

they say armenians get out of here

we dont open the door we say if we have to leave well leave well leave tomorrow

they say no leave now get out of here armenian dogs get out of here

by now theyve broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides

we hold them off as best we can my father and i on one side and my mother and brother on the other

we had prepared ourselves we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves

they broke in the door and when the door gave way we held it for another halfhour

no neighbors no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time

we held the door

they started to smash the door on the lock side first with an axe and then with a crowbar

when the door gave waythey tore it off its hingessasha hit one of them with the axe

the axe flew out of his hands

they also had axes crowbars pipes and special rods made from armature shafts

one of them hit my father in the head

the pressure from the mob was immense

when we retreated into the room one of them hit my mother too in the left part of her face

my brother sasha and i fought back of course

sasha is quite strong and hottempered he was the judo champion of sumgait

we had hammers in our hands and we injured several of the banditsin the heads and in the eyes all that went on

but they the injured ones fell back and others came to take their places there were many of them

the door fell down at an angle

the mob tried to remove the door so as to go into the second room and to continue 





to finish us off

father brought skewers and gave them to sasha and mewe flew at them when we saw father bleeding his face was covered with blood he had been wounded in the head and his whole face was bloody

we just threw ourselves on them when we saw that

we threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall drove them down to the third floor

we came out on the landing but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there having closed the door behind them

we started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them

then a man an imposing man of about  an azerbaijani came in

when he was coming in father fell down and mother flew to him and started to cry out

i jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen

we live on the fourth floor

and no one came

i went into the room

it seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group

he was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar

and he addressed my mother in azerbaijani whats with you woman why are you shouting

what happened

why are you shouting like that

she says what do you mean what happened

you killed somebody

my father was a musician he played the clarinet he played at many weddings armenian and azerbaijani he played for many years

everyone knew him

mother says the person who you killed played at thousands of azerbaijani weddings he brought so much joy to people and you killed that person

he says you dont need to shout stop shouting

and when they heard the voice of this man the  to  people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out

we chased after them but they ran away

that man left too

as we were later told downstairs one of them told the others i dont know if it was from fright or what told them that we had firearms even though we only fought with hammers and an axe

we raced to father and started to massage his heart but it was already too late

we asked the neighbors to call an ambulance

the ambulance never came although we waited for it all evening and all through the night

somewhere around midnight about  policemen came

they informed us they were from khachmas

they said we heard that a group was here at your place you have our condolences

they told us not to touch anything and left

father lay in the room

so we stayed home

each of us took a hammer and a knife

we sat at home

well we say if they descend on us again well defend ourselves

somewhere around one oclock in the morning two people came from the sumgait procuracy investigators

they say leave everything just how it is were coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything

then people came from the republic procuracy too but no one helped us take father away

the morning came and the neighbors arrived

we wanted to take father away somehow

we called the procuracy and the police a couple of times but no one came

we called an ambulance and nobody came

then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide

we secured the door somehow or other

we left father in the room and went up to the neighbors

the excesses began again in the morning

the bandits came in several vehicles zil panel trucks and threw themselves out of the vehicles like 





a landing force near the center of town

our building was located right there

a crowd formed

then they started fighting with the soldiers

then in buildings  and  thats next to the airline ticket office they started breaking into armenian apartments destroying property and stealing

the armenians werent at home they had managed to flee and hide somewhere

and again they poured in the direction of our building

they were shouting that there were some armenians left on the fourth floor meaning us

theyre up there still up there

lets go kill them

they broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms threw it outside and burned it in large fires

we were hiding one floor up

something heavy fell

sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably father they had thrown father were defiling the corpse probably throwing it in the fire going to burn it

i heard it and the sound was kind of hollow and i said no thats from some of the furniture

mother and i pounced on sasha and stopped him somehow and calmed him down

the mob left somewhere around eight oclock

they smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us

they were also armenians they had left for another city

the father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said are you crazy

why are you hiding armenians

dont you now theyre checking all the apartments

they could kill you and them

and to us  





come on leave this apartment

we went down to the third floor to some other neighbors

at first the man didnt want to let us in but then one of his sons asked him and he relented

we stayed there until eleven oclock at night

we heard the sound of motors

the neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers

we went downstairs

there was a light on in the room where we left father

in the other rooms as we found out later all the chandeliers had been torn down

they left only one bulb

the bulb was burning which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our microdistrict  where there had been a pogrom

with the help of the soldiers we made it to the city party committee and were saved

our salvationmy mothers my brothers and minewas purely accidental because as we later found out from the neighbors someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there

well we fought but we were only able to save mother

we couldnt save father

we inflicted many injuries on the bandits some of them serious

but others came to take their places

we were also wounded there was blood and we were scratched all overwe got our share

it was a miracle we survived

we were saved by a miracle and the troops

and if troops hadnt come to sumgait the slaughter would have been even greater probably all the armenians would have been victims of the genocide

through an acquaintance at the city party committee i was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us experts

we went to  pick up fathers corpse

we took it to the morgue

this was about two oclock in the morning it was already march  it was raining very hard and it was quite cold and we were wearing only our suits

when my brother and i carried father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses

there were about six burned people in there and the small corpse of a burned child

it was gruesome

i suffered a tremendous shock

there were about ten people there but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to baku

there was a womans corpse there too she had been 





well there was part of a body there 





a hackedoff part of a womans body

it was something terrible

the morgue was guarded by the landing force 





the child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old

it was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned

there was a man there too several men

you couldnt tell anything because their faces were disfigured they were in such awful condition now two and a half months have passed

every day i recall with horror what happened in the city of sumgait

every day my father and the death of my father and how we fought and the peoples sorrow and especially the morgue

i still want to say that  years have passed since soviet power was established and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened in sumgait

it will go down in history

im particularly surprised that the mob wasnt even afraid of the troops

they even fought the soldiers

many soldiers were wounded

the mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers setting them on fire

they werent afraid

they were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops

i saw the clashes on february  near the airline ticket office right across from our building

and that mob was fighting with the soldiers

the inhabitants of some of the buildings also azerbaijanis threw rocks at the soldiers from windows balconies even cinder blocks and glass tanks

they werent afraid of them

i say they were sure of their impunity

when we were at the neighbors and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office i called the police at number  and said that they were robbing armenian apartments and burning homes

and they told me that they knew that they were being burned

during those days no one from the police department came to anyones aid

no one came to help us either to our home even though perhaps they could have come and saved us

as we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs near the bus station

rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting

so i think all of it was arranged in advance

they even knew in which buildings and apartments the armenians lived on which floorsthey had lists the bandits

you can tell that the operation was planned in advance

thanks of course to our troops to the countrys leadership and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for helping us thanks to the russian people because the majority of the troops were russians and the troops suffered losses too

i want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenians and in the name of all sumgait armenians

for coming in time and averting terrible things worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time

at present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the ussr procuracy

i want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment because if they dont the tragedy the genocide could happen again

everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds

very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest in the mass disturbances

the mobs were huge

at present not all of them have been caught very few of them have been i think judging by the newspaper reports

there were around  people near our building alone thats how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in all

they should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such acts

it is deceiving to judge the resistance movement out of the context of the occupation

 alaa zeineldine when the plo moved into lebanon and became in parts of lebanon an occupying power itself these same practices were common against nonpalestinean and palestinean alike

they are simply standard operating procedures among palestineans and have been for a very long time

in fact the greatest bloodbath of palestineans will happen when they get selfrule

can you possibly deny this

the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the area of transcaucasia to over  square miles

the estimated population of the entire region in  was  of whom   percent were armenian   percent georgian and   percent moslem

of the latter group  were tatars

paradoxically barely onethird of transcaucasias armenians lived in the erevan guberniia where the christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds

erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only  armenians as compared to  moslems

by the time of the russian census of  however the armenians had established a scant majority  percent in the guberniia it had risen by  to  percent or  of the  inhabitants

this impressive change in the provinces ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic a solid block of  tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia

we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination

our troops surrounded village after village

little resistance was offered

our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work

some of the tartars escaped of course

they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey

the rest were killed

and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages

they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead

such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in armenia brings a depth and verification to the turkish genocide that is hard to match

a hundred years ago armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the russian anarchists that they accepted as role models

several armenian terror groups like asalasdpaarf terrorism and revisionism triangle resorted to the same tactics in the s butchering scores of innocent turks and their families in the united states and europe

it seems that    onur yalcin you know as little about the history and the demography of the  onur yalcin island as you know about the essence of turkeys  onur yalcin military intervention to it under international agreements

then why did not greece invade cyprus 

henrik  your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence

im not going to spend time to review with you the recent history of cyprus

if you are really interested i can provide you with a number of references on the issue

just send me email for that

  onur yalcin be that as it may an analogy between an act of occupation in  onur yalcin history and what is going on today on azerbaijani land can only  onur yalcin be drawn with the expansionist policy that armenia is now  pursuing

  buch of crap and you know it

nagarnokarabagh has always been part  of armenia and it was stalin who gave it to the azeris

go back and  review the history

  the armenians in nagarnokarabagh are simply defending their rights  to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are invading their  teritory

  onur yalcin but i could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to  onur yalcin the political conduct of countries and promulgate them in such  onur yalcin terminology as itchybitchy   i was not the one that stated it

 relax

youre swinging fists into open air

i was agreeing with you assuming that would be one of your points that you did not state

you may not be very much used to it to be agreed with  that is but take it more easily



  however i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane  to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one no henrik believe me you dont hope that

 that happened last summer

turkey searched an american plane  carrying humanitarian aid bound to armenia

 was that after or before one french plane changed its route to avoid inspection

if we are guilty of something so is  everyone else

unfortunately for you nabil jewish tribes are not  nearly as susceptible to the fratricidal murdering that is still so  common among arabs in the middle east

there were no  killings  between the jewish tribes on the way

i dont like this comment about typical thinking

you could state your interpretation of exodus without it

as i read exodus i can see a lot of killing there which is painted by the author of the bible in ideologicalreligious colors

the history in the desert can be seen as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land

thats why i think it is a great book with which descendants arabs turks and mongols can unify as well

you somehow missed nabils comments even though you included it in your followup the number which could have arrived to the holy lands must have been substantially less ude to the harsh desert and the killings between the jewish tribes on the way

i am not aware of killings between jewish tribes in the desert

the point of typical thinking here is that while arabs still today act in the manner you describe like any nomadic people occupying a land killing and plundering each other with regularity others have somehow progressed over time

it is not surprising then that arabs often accuse others infidels of things that they are quite familiar with civil rights violations religious discrimination ethnic cleansing land theft torture and murder

it is precisely this mechanism at work that leads people to say that jewish tribes were killing each other in the desert even without support for such a ludicrous suggestion

now read carefully the following and then speak the recent helsinki watch  page report broken promises torture and ditto

 helsinki watch problems of turks in western thrace continue ankara aa in a page report of the helsinki watch it is stated that the turkish minority in western thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the greek government be brought to an end

the report on western thrace emphasized that the greek government should grant social and political rights to all the members of minorities that are equal to those enjoyed by greek citizens and in addition they must recognize the existence of the turkish minority in western thrace and grant them the right to identify themselves as turks

newspot may   greece isolates west thrace turks the xanthi independent mp ahmet faikoglu said that the greek state is trying to cut all contacts and relations of the turkish minority with turkey

pointing out that while the greek minority living in istanbul is called greek by ethnic definition only the religion of the minority in western thrace is considered

in an interview with the greek newspaper ethnos he said i am a greek citizen of turkish origin

the individuals of the minority living in western trace are also turkish

emphasizing the education problem for the turkish minority in western thrace faikoglu said that according to an agreement signed in  greece must distribute textbooks printed in turkey in turkish minority schools in western thrace

recalling his activities and those of komotini independent mp dr sadik ahmet to defend the rights of the turkish minority faikoglu said

in fact we helped greece

because we prevented greece the cradle of democracy from losing face before european countries by forcing the greek government to recognize our legal rights

on turcogreek relations he pointed out that both countries are predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical reasons and said that turkey and greece must resist the foreign powers who are trying to create a rift between them by cooperating adding that in turkey he observed that there was will to improve relations with greece

newspot january   macedonian human rights activists to face trial in greece

two ethnic macedonian human rights activists will face trial in athens for alleged crimes against the greek state according to a court summons no

obtained by mils

hristos sideropoulos and tashko bulev or anastasios bulis have been charged under greek criminal law for making comments in an athenian magazine

sideropoulos and bulev gave an interview to the greek weekly magazine ena on march   and said that they as macedonians were denied basic human rights in greece and would field an ethnic macedonian candidate for the upcoming greek general election

bulev said in the interview i am not greek i am macedonian

sideropoulos said in the article that greece should recognise macedonia

the allegations regarding territorial aspirations against greece are tales we are in a panic to secure the border at a time when the borders and barriers within the eec are falling

the main charge against the two according to the court summons was that they have spreadintentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country greece

the greek state does not recognise the existence of a macedonian ethnicity

there are believed to be between  to  ethnic macedonians living within greece largely concentrated in the north

it is a crime against the greek state if anyone declares themselves macedonian

in  greece serbiayugoslavia and bulgaria partioned macedonia into three pieces

in  albania took  macedonian villages

the part under serboyugoslav occupation broke away in  as the independent republic of macedonia

there are 

million macedonians in the republic  in bulgaria  in albania and  in serbia proper

sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for macedonian human rights in greece and lost his job as a forestry worker a few years ago

he was even exiled to an obscure greek island in the mediteranean

only pressure from amnesty international forced the greek government to allow him to return to his home town of florina lerin in northern greece aegean macedonia where the majority of ethnic macedonians live

balkan watchers see the sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour the republic of macedonia

last year the state department of the united states condemned greece for its bad treatment of ethnic macedonians and turks who largely live in western thrace

but it remains to be seen if the us government will do anything until the presidential elections are over

 by  elias davidsson having stated my assumptions i will now state my proposal

 

a fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is israelijew and the other palestinianarab

 

the emergence of a considerable number of mixed marriages in israelpalestine all of whom would have relatives on both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society

the existence of a strong mixed stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the   sounds just like a racial theory that hitler outlined in mein kampf

someone else said something similar

i will not comment on the value or lack of value of eliass proposal

i just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of nazi racial doctrine

they were not like eliass idea they were more like the opposite

nazis believed in racial purity not racial assimilation

an instructive example is the nazi attitude to gypsies

according to nazi theoreticians gypsies were an aryan race

they were persecuted and in huge numbers murdered because most european gypies were considered not pure gypsies but mongrels formed from the pure gypsy race and other undesirable races

this was the key difference between the theoretical approach to jews and gypsies by the way

it is also true that towards the end of wwii even the purist gypsies were hunted down as the theory was forgotten

the negev as a military base xiv

the negev in the year  just after the creation of the state of israel the phrase the jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom was trumpeted throughout the western world

after the six day war in  david bengurion declared in a letter to charles de gaulle its by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land created builtup areas towns and villages in abandoned desert areas

contrary to bengurions assertion it must be affirmed that during the  years of the british mandate over palestine and for centuries previous a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the negev desert  in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern negev as well as in the more fertile north

these were the bedouin arabs

the real desertification of the negev mainly in the southern part occurred after israels dispossession of the bedouins cultivated lands and pastures

nowadays the majority of the  squarekilometer negev which represents  percent of the state of israel pre borders has been desertified beyond recognition

the main new occupiers of the formerly bedouin negev are the israeli army the nature reserves authority whose chief role is to prevent bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands and vast industrial zones including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical nuclear and other wastes

israeli jews in the negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the bedouin before  and there is no jewish pastoral activity

i

agricultural and pastoral activities of the negev bedouin before and after   in  according to british mandatory statistics the beersheba subdistrict which corresponds more or less to israels negev or southern district had  inhabitants almost all bedouin arabs who held  camels  cows and oxen  sheep and  goats

the majority of the bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north where precipitation ranged between  and  mm per year

in  they cultivated about  hectares of the beersheba district  ie

percent of its total area and more than double the area cultivated by the negevs jewish settlers after  years of making the desert bloom the bedouin had a very low crop yield   to  kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years  and their farming techniques were primitive but production was based solely on animal and human labor

it must also be underscored that animal production although low was based entirely on pasturing

production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years

all bedouin pasture animals  goats camels and sheep  had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers

these animals were the result of a centuriesold process of natural selection in harsh local conditions

after the creation of the state of israel  percent of the negev bedouin were expelled to the sinai or to southern jordan

the  who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of  hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was  mm  a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three

the rare water wells in the south and central negev spring of life in the desert were cemented to prevent bedouin shepherds from roaming

a few bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central negev

but after  when the sinai was returned to egypt these bedouin were also eliminated

at the same time strong pressure was applied on the bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army

no reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by negev bedouin

it is a known fact that a large part of the  hectares they cultivated in the s has been seized by the israeli authorities

indeed most of the bedouin are now confined to seven development towns or sowetos established for them

this was  announced last night by prime minister yitzhak rabin and finance  minister avraham shohat in an effort to create more jobs for  palestinian residents of the territories

this infusion of money  will bring allocations given to developing infrastructure in the  territories this year to  million nis up from last years  figure of  million nis

while i applaud investing of money in yehuda shomron vchevelazza in order to create jobs for their residents i find it deplorable that this has never been an active policy of any israeli administration since  with regard to their jewish residents

past governments found funds to subsidize cheap read affordable housing and the requisite infrastructure but where was the investment for creating industry which would have generated income and jobs

after  years yehuda and shomron remain barren bereft of even middlesized industries and the jewish settlements are sterile bedroom communities havens for in the main israelis both secular and religious who work in telaviv or jerusalem but cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs

from center for policy research cprigcapcorg subject gaza and separation from israel nfid ncdp nffrom cdpuucpcpr apr    lines  from center for policy research cpr subject gaza and separation from israel gaza and the idea of separation the israeli lefts inability to cope with the challenges it is presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left

we were able to see this clearly during the gulf war

because of the palestinians popular solidarity with iraq yossi sarid  currently minister of the environment  made his infamous statement you look for me  ie iam not making any more efforts to speak with you

from yossi sarids point of view palestinian reality during the gulf war was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it but whether or not the palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party

similarly meretz mk deddi tzuker recently faced with criticism from residents of the west bank town of beit sahour over his governments and his partys lack of action for human rights and peace responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a likud government

from the leftists perspective this is the best government because it is their government regardless of what it does

these members of the israeli left have already decided how the future of the occupied territories will look and they want to dictate to the palestinians how to get there

an essential step towards this future is their participation in yitzhak rabins government and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this government of peace which need not disturb the routine course of events

likewise the rabinic policies in gaza  the blowing up of houses with antitank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations  need not disturb it

but the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way when a settler is stabbed by his palestinian workers or when a palestinian knifes people in the streets of tel aviv

then all hell breaks loose and the israeli left has nothing to propose except separation lets cut ourselves off from the palestinians lets build a fence so high that they wont be able to harm us  this is the cry of the israeli left

let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation

meron benvenisti writes about this in haaretz  the liberal left

which does not differentiate between physical separation and the future of the territories must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards exclusion of arab workers closure and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt and that their ideological support for separation only provides humanitarian arguments for the legitimization of the status quo

enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden



whoover thinks that out of gaza first is a liberal humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral

it is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering and to thus also disregard responsibility for its creation

it is very easy to erect a fence between jewish and arab neighborhoods in jerusalem when this fence has a gate  the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand  which opens to allow the jews to pursue all their interests but is barred to the arabs  from the other front jerusalem  march

 actually if can remember correctly was it not reported and even on camera some time during the israeli invasion of lebanon or when the itifada began that cnn caught regular uniformed israeli soldiers breaking the arms of some arab youngsters in a very professional and brutal manner someone please give full details if they can remember

so was it on cnn or not

this is one of the few occassions on which such a scene has been transmitted to the west and in the usa  it caused uproar and was one of the factors that has significantly changed the preception of the israeli armys role in the mideast

 so there is proof for you

what proof

you said above was it not reported and someone please give full details if they can remember

hear say is not proof

it is obvious that is a systematic policy of the israelis which must be occurring on a massive scale behind the scenes

yes like the  or more palestinians brutally murdered by their brothers

 nadeem   naftaly stramer  intergraph electronics internet nstramerdazixcoingrcom   lookout road suite a voice  fax   boulder co  quality is everybodys job and its everybodys job to watch all that they can

you definetly are in need of a shrink loser

hey cheesedicks stop sending messages to a guy whos not going to read them

and who cares anyway

 snip  imagine 

it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer  in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc   i would not argue that all or even most of the villages are terrorist  camps

there are however some which come very close to serving that  purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way  prior to the invasion

the village i described was actually the closest i could come to describing mine

i agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often

in such villages often the only remaining inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go

but for the most part the typical south lebanon village is more like mine

one where civilians and guerillas live together

they are often inhabiting the same house

many families are large some have members of the families involved in hizollah most others are not

that is what is so hard of south lebanon israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace

not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army

 some of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you  describe

not all are

there are a large number of groups in the area  backed by various organizations with a wide range of purposes

hizbollah  and amal were two of the larger ones and may still be

hizbollah and amal are now the main two militias

though hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance operation and better motivated by religious conviction

as to retaliation  while mistakes may be made that is still a far cry from indiscriminate  bombing which would have produced major casualties

it may be a mixture of what we both say

sometimes israel chooses its targets carefully

at other times it just sends its pilots on sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the attackers came from that specific village but has no further intelligence

on several occasions israel retalliated against civilian refugee camps even in north lebanon just to show that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked

most of the time it directs the sla to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some lebanese villages on the other side

i have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions this is why the sla militia is sometimes even more despised than israeli troops

  well here we disagree

i think that israel would willingly withdraw if  the lebanese govt was able to field a reliable force in the area to police  it and prevent further attacks

i hope you are right on israeli willingness to withdraw but i still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for israels security since it would reduce its military losses and i claim that the lebanese and syrian govts would be able to prevent any further attacks on northern israel

 there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese  goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such  circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is  capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did  in all other parts of lebanon

  no the syrian govt is more than happy to have israel sink into another  lebanese morass

i could elaborate if necessary

hmm

here we disagree on what serves syria interests better

i think syria wants to have lebanon all to itself

it would be willing to guarantee northern israels security in return for israeli withdrawal

i dont think syria wants israel to be involved in its protectorate of lebanon

syria is sitting at the negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants to get a political resolution

a renewal of hostilities along the lebanese front could put the whole me peace negotiations back in question

 i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing  cannot be qualified as murder no matter what you say

  no but it is regretable as is the whole situation

i agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable

it was apparently made with a hand held camcorder the quality was terrible and the camera was really jumpy

the documentary sic told the tales of all of the children who died in the war against the jews as martyrs

it was a regular sob story

one victimized youth was recounting on how all he really wants to do is to get an education and that the big bad jews wont let him go to high school

he admittedly spent  years in prison age  to  for murdering a jewish woman but claims that it was for the cause

i have seen this kind of garbage before

i have a lot of sympathy for the palestinian cause as do many jews but i think that even many arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary

one must remember that children often bring stress into households

as an alternative one could consider financial incentives for every sexual act performed by two partners of different ethnic backgrounds

the plan could be entitled peace income sexual security or piss for short

every time an israeli gets screwed by a palestinian or visa versa they would be eligible for income

in keeping with the spirit of the times condoms would be a tax deductible expense

this policy does not discriminate on a gender basis nor would it apply to domestic animals of either nationality

joint palestinanisraeli teams would be obligated to ensure that all acts were voluntary and promptly rewarded

the teams of palestinianisrael morals patrols or pimps would receive a percentage of the financial income in order to encourage their participation and add to their incentive in locating suitable candidates

adam schwartz adamsroboticsberkeleyedu

come on

most if not all arabs are sympathetic to the palestinian war against israel

i wouldnt bet on it

arab governments generally dont care much about the palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home

they are happy to leave the palestineans largely under israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the israelis

the israelis dont like this job any more than king hussein of jordan liked it  and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an intifada in jordan

the governments of syria lebanon and egypt all feel similarly

however proclaiming public support for the palestinean war against israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal arab tyrants

arab people probably arent much more sympathetic

palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in jordan lebanon and kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere

you might still be right in sympathy to the war against israel but i suspect that many arabs far removed from the immediate border with israel eg

in kuwait or morroco couldnt care less

jewish religion was the foundation for christianity and islam

in other words judaism has fathered both religions

now islam has turned against its father i may say

it is ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise

i thought the idea of believing on one god was to unite all man kind

how come both jews and islam which believe on the same god the god of ebrahim are killing each other

is this like dr frankenstiens story

how are you going to stop this from happening

how are you going to deal with so many muslims

nuking them would distroy the whole world

would god get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same god same heaven and the same hell after all

what is the peacefull way of ending this saga

man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state

a religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society

the praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it

god does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes that god will help him when he prays

religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life

but the religious leaders need to make a living through religion

so they may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to make their living

ie muslims have to pay  percent of their income to the mullahs

i guess the rabie gets his cut too

is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other helps one another respect the mother nature

is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today

is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will see the outcome of his choice

how can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion

how can we stop another religious killing field under poor gods name

what are your thoughts

do you think man kind would to come its senses before it is too late

ps

on the side do you think that moses saw the god on mount sina

why would god go to top of the mountain

he created the earth he could have been anywhere

why on top the mountain

was it because people thought to see god you have to reach to the skiesheavens

why god kept coming back to middle east

was it because they created god through their imagination

is that why jewish people were told by god they were the chosen ones

profit mohammad was married to khadijeh

she was a jewish

she taught him how to trade

she probably taught him about judaism

quran is mostly copy right of taurah sp

old testement

do you think god wrote quran

makeh was a trade city before islam

do you think it was made to be the center of islamic world because mohammad wanted to expand his trade business

is that why god has put his house in there

i think this religious stuff has gone too far

all man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up

look at david koresh how that turned out

i am afraid in the bigger scale the jews and the muslims will have the same ending

religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than plotting each others distruction

there is one earth one life and one god

lets all man kind be good toward each other

god help us all

peace

well your armenian grandparents were fascist

as early as  k s papazian asserted in patriotism perverted that the armenians lean toward fascism and hitlerism

 at that time he could not have foreseen that the armenians would actively assume a progerman stance and even collaborate in world war ii

his book was dealing with the armenian genocide of turkish population of eastern anatolia

however extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the second world war

in  for example o zarmooni of the tzeghagrons was quoted in the hairenik weekly the race is force it is treasure

if we follow history we shall see that races due to their innate force have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation

today germany and italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race

on the other hand russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities

is it true that the israeli authorities dont recognize israeli nationality 

and that id cards which israeli citizens must carry at all times identify people as jews or arabs not as israelis 



is it true that the state of israel has no fixed borders and that israeli governments from  until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the state of israel should be 



is it true that israeli stocks nuclear weapons 

if so could you provide any evidence 



is it true that in israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets 



is it true that jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than nonjews



is it true that jews who left palestine in the war  to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return while their christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return 



is it true that israels prime minister y rabin signed an order for ethnical cleansing in  as is done today in bosniaherzegovina 



is it true that israeli arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim



is it true that israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between jews and nonjews

just a couple of questions for the proisraeli lobby out there   is israels occupation of southern lebanon temporary

for mr stein i am working on a proof for you that israel is diverting water to the jordan river away from lebanese territory

yes

as long as the goverment over there can force some authority and prevent terrorists attack against israel

  is israels occupation of the west bank gaza and golan temporary

if so for those of you who support it why were so many settlers moved into the territories

if it is not temporary lets hear it

sinai had several big cities that were avcuated when isreal gave it back to egypth but for a peace agreement

so it is my opinin that the settlers will not be an obstacle for withdrawal as long it is combined with a real peace agreement with the arabs and the palastinians

 you shouldnt need any power tools to undo it an electric drill probably wont give you much extra torque anyway

you should be able to undo it with a spanner

when it loosens it will probably become very loose and you will bash your knuckles on the underside of the car  this is the price you must pay for doing you own work

 no thats the price you pay for not knowing how to use a wrench

you want to pull the wrench towards you away from painful knuckle splitting hard things

if you cant pull it because things are in the way push it with an open hand

is it worthwhile to get an alarm system on a new car

although others have in the past and will continue to disagree i think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm

what features are important

i think that it is important to protect your trunk engine bay all doors

id get flashing lights leds mounted on the drivers and passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation

toss in a glass break sensor and shock sensor

door lock and unlock two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have

most important is where you have the installation done

some places may cost a little more but a poorly installed alarm no matter how much it cost will be a major burden

what features are unimportant

the diaphragm which controls outsideventin sideno vent air is cracked most of the way around and the other one is probably damaged too considering the advanced age of the car

four or five  cars were hit

there were several serious injuries and sadly  a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck  in the head by one of the larger rocks

i dont recall if she  made it but i think she was comatose for a month or so and  doctors werent holding out hope that shed live

   what the hell is happening to this great country of ours

i  can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but   pound rocks

has our society really stooped this low

   erik velapold   society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams

the basic reason  is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is  no big deal

kids see hundreds on murderous acts on tv we can abort  children on demand and kill the sick and old at will

so why be surprised  when some kids drop  lbs rocks and kill people

they dont care because the  message they hear is life is cheap

  at well people fortunatly or unfortunatly  only the us is experiencing the devaluation of human life among developed nations

i am an american but i was raised in europe where the worst thing that can happen to somebody is get his car broken into or have his pocket picked by slaves or russian refugees

of cource there will be some nutcases but thats extremely rare

ie

in greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during the night without even worrying

in germany  you can walk the sidewalks at 

am and not even look behind your back at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a sparkling cleen

whoever of you have been there you know what i am saying

i dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism we might get somewhere

of course these postings sould be in soccultureus but if we reduce crime here it ll mean less car insurance rates thus we could spend more money on modifing our cars

 i looked into getting ac installed on my  honda crx si

 the unit is  plus shipping installation is like   hours on  top of that

this is a hunk of change

  does anyone know any place that does aftermarket ac installation  not with a honda ac unit but some third party unit

  i cannot seem to find anyone who can put a third party ac unit in a  honda

i am in no carolina so i would prefer some place nearby but  any references would be handy

  thx andy brandtcsuncedu sorry i cant help you with your question but i do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket ac units

i have a frostking or frosttemp forget which aftermarket unit on my cavalier and am quite unhappy with it

the fan is noisy and doesnt put out much air

i will never have an aftermarket ac installed in any of my vehicles again

as long as were on the subject several years ago myself and two others were riding in the front of a toyota pickup heading south on interstate  north of seattle wa

someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our windshield

not by accident im sure it was impossible to get up to the overpass quickly to see who did it

we figured it was kids reported it and left

a couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company

he was in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children

turned out there was a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away

they caught the  year old that did it

they put a cover over the overpass what else could they do

execute the juvi on the grounds of the reformatory required attendendence by the rest of the inmates as soon as possible after the incident and a quick sure trial

i am quite serious

cause and effect

nothing else will ever make a dent

any opinions

organization lawrence berkeley laboratory  berkeley ca usa lines  distribution na nntppostinghost  newssoftware vaxvms vnews 

 i just read articals on this in road and track and car and driver  is that one mag or two

b and i was wondering if people out  there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to say

depending on how you plan to use your suv i might recommend also browsing trailer boats and one or more of those pickup shotgun and wd magazines

the car rags mostly seem to consider recently graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips to be a bedload

considering that most of these suvs seem to be used mostly as robust station wagons thats probably not a bad approach but if your applications are more demanding pick your information sources accordingly

of the three vehicles on your short list explorer runner pathfinder id recommend the runner as being closely based on a rather robust pickup and the explorer for being comfortably carlike

dont know much about the pathfinder

good luck joe just another personal opinion from the peoples republic of berkeley

 jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

 i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power

i am considering the mx probe accord corolla and the sx

 i bought a  probe gt with the pep a last july now at  miles after debating over the sentra sernx mx mr stealth prelude and celica

 the car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its reliability so far

for what its worth my comments  my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal

some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented about this problem but i havent seen it happen on my  month old  probe gt

i think this may be something that ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars

also someone said that ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it

headlights have stuck up a few times weather

air conditioning broke  miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely

havent seen any of these problems nor have i seen these mentioned on the mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these

crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical definitely

parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical

assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly

hopefully just a fluke

no problems like these either

i havent been able to find any obvious places where they screwed up

ford only gives  key with the car

cmon ford spend an extra few pennies

hmmm

i got two keys with my car

something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this

actually if you count the credit card key that came in the owners binder i got  keys but since the credit card key doesnt have any teeth cut in it yet i guess i wont count it

 rear hatch has no padding on corners when up

im waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner

horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference the latter is probably because of the air bag

its pretty much takes up all the space where youd expect to find the horn

speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind

the previous probes had japanese horns

tires fling dirtmud onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes

my likes engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely  handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the  speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the  sho i drive stability at mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather absair bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still

tires vr goodyear eagles  left hoping for k  i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine

the interior is very very nice too

very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound

 i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probes suspension doesnt like potholes

when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable

yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone

i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car id strongly suggest looking into the mx

if you have  passengers by all means bring them along too

theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you

the problem with the back seat is that theres no leg room

plenty of head room though

shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to give them a place to put their feet

also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer

my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat

the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car

 i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then ive always been a sucker for open air driving

no leakage problems or anything like thatyet

ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine

i havent heard about this one

i know that some of the very early probes  and maybe  had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which ford will replace at no charge but i havent heard about anything like this concerning the  probes

i havent had any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car

i was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering that i was expecting the worst from them

from what ive heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point

thats almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though

organization csri university of toronto lines  hi maybe someone can help me here

i am looking to buy this  nissan maxima gxe for cdn right now

the car has  km or about  miles on it

a typical mileage for  cars seem to be about  km or about k mi

the seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards

he said he will replace the components before selling the car to me

being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars i dont know what this could mean is k km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items

or is this an indication that the car was abused

would other things break down or have to be replaced soon

the seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot but i dont know how to verify this ive seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood though

although the maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept its currently out of warranty a similarly priced  accord with k km will have  years or k km worth of warranty left and i dont want to worry about paying for any repair bills

but i also need a car for  people

when will the new maxima come out by the way

i would very much appreciate your input in this

now that i know how simple a procedure it is it looks like ill be paying my local pep boys a visit this weekend mik

im wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter

ive been doing it my self over  miles on my current toyota truck ive got over k ive heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission

my experiences suggest otherwise

what techniques do you use

yeah

i dont use the clutch all the time either

ive done it with fords bmw datsun and chevy and it works fine

i cant think of any reason that it would damage the tranny

essentially you are just doing what the synchros do anyhow  match the engine speed with the tranny speed and slip it into gear

on some old pieces of junk i drove the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except clutchless

to date ive driven rabbits datsuns comets fords  a chevy

some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker  easier they where to shift

my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever

if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator  try agian

ive found that clutchless shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms 

i also skip gears some times using  

sounds about right

i usually slip it out during throttledown and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right usually about a second and then slip it into gear krispy   jon you obviously dont know who youre dealing with gross jonghalcyoncom

 are there any mr owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why my mrs engine sounds noisy

the mrs engine is noisy at the best of times but not even a nice nose  its one of those very ugly noises

 assuming yours is a non turbo mr the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline  that doesnt have balance shafts

i guess toyota didnt care about little details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling

 myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or recommendation which has an inline  larger than  liters and no balance shafts it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine

 if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a v   eliot nice theory

too bad the mrs never came with a four cylinder over 

liters

more like  or did they

were the nonturbo mriis 

or some such

i also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders must pay saab a royalty for using their patented designlike porsches

sorry for the  auto content but     that is why lowabiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves  and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is  imminent

  steve heracleous  you do have the power steve

you can do it

why dont you

why dont you go shoot some kids who are tossing rocks onto cars

make sure you do a good job though  dont miss  cause like they have big rocks  and take it from me  those kids are mean

that is absolutely correct

they have a streak of meanness that runs much deeper and stronger than anything i ever experienced even during the height of the s racial struggles

i am absolutely convinced that there are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong but have the human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that have ever walked the earth

they will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection

in a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from

we live in south fla so we are definitely in the right are for one

from nathanpscocom nathan subject re ford probe  opinions

centered around the gt organization the santa cruz operation lines  jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

 i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power

i am considering the mx probe accord corolla and the sx

 the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions

but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value

btw the sx is rearwheel drive and is due for a redesign for 

 thanks in advance

while i dont read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting

i bought a  probe gt with the pep a last july now at  miles after debating over the sentra sernx mx mr stealth prelude and celica

check this months consumer reports for previous probe records

my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over hp and less than k

i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out

the tristar cars eclipsetalonetc were out since they dont have an air bag

ditto for the mustangalso no abs

the sernxm fell into the pocketrocket category

a good used car buy

the mx was almost there but rolled more than i liked

i didnt like the prelude dashinstrumentation at all

too weird for me

the mr has a much smaller nonpassenger space than i needed so out that went

the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in nonturbo form

i never considered the sx since it didnt have an airbag

i did look at it for its rwd virtues but thats it

the corolla never entered my mind

i should have looked at the mitsubishi vrdodge stealth more

since my list was exhausted i bought the probe

 the car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its reliability so far

for what its worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal

headlights have stuck up a few times weather

air conditioning broke  miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely

crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical

assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly

hopefully just a fluke

ford only gives  key with the car

cmon ford spend an extra few pennies

rear hatch has no padding on corners when up

im waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner

horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference tires fling dirtmud onto side of car my likes engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely  handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the  speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the  sho i drive stability at mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather absair bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still

tires vr goodyear eagles  left hoping for k  as you can see im primarily interested in the engine

while it doesnt have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling point for me was the allaluminum  value 

liter engine

the overall car is a good buy for the money

that market segment hasnt changed much since july prelude vtec honda del sol

i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probes suspension doesnt like potholes

when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable

if you have  passengers by all means bring them along too

theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you

also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer

my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat

ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine

leather and the keyless entry system werent available when i got the car so i cant comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced

i prefer cloth to leather anyway

i wouldnt want this car in the snow the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes tires arent meant for snow and the seats assume that youre not wearing lots of thick clothing

rain is much better water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles and i was really trying

there is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places

the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door but theyre rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cds max

the center consolestorage binarm rest has  cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch but thats it

no change holders

quite a letdown from the sho

and the probe is definitely not a peoplemover car or an econobox car

lastly dont store wet car covers in the back

the foam will soak the water up and the result will not smell pleasant

 thanx to all those who responded particularly those never driven an xxx but heres what its like guys  ok we all know that newage ats are great in traffic and do a satisfactory job in acceleration when you keep your foot buried in the carpet

 my question regards downshifting

not downshifting to pass ats are good at this now but manually moving the lever to   or  at a point where you would downshift a manual eg

approaching a red light or a curve or just tooling around a parking lot in st or nd wo shifting

this is why im still a manualtrans bigot the downshifting for deceleration seems so natural

when i try this in an automatic the tranny doesnt seem to understand what i want

 addendum isnt it great after downshifting while approaching that red light when the light goes green and youre already oncam or the turbos already spooled up

long silly discussion deleted  and while youre at it why bother with removing the drain plug when you could remove the dipstick instead and suck it out from there with your mouth and then spit it out

this suggestion isnt as farfetched as it sounds

years ago in another time and place i used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines

in many cases there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side

and if you did get something there youd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again

so we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole

there was a longthin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube and another thickershorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container

im sure these gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one

you can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in place of the bolt

i have one on both of my cars

there have been no leaks in  miles combined miles on both cars

yes but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot

all they have to do is reach underneath turn a valve and forget the trip home

but there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them

i personally recommend installing a special locking drain plug to keep vandals away

i have a frostking or frosttemp forget which aftermarket unit on my cavalier and am quite unhappy with it

the fan is noisy and doesnt put out much air

i will never have an aftermarket ac installed in any of my vehicles again

i just cant trust the quality and performance after this experience

  les  let me add my 

in

i had a ac installed by the ford garage and it did not work as well as the ac that was installed by the factory in pickups identical to mine

i have talked to other people that have had the same result

dont know if this is just a probable with ford or what

  ernie smith i agree never have the dealer add anything to your car

if you want ac make sure it is factory installedhondas maybe excluded many cant be bought with ac installed at the factory but i think maybe they actually use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one inas in bigger radiator etcor are designed properly for this in the st place anyway my point is the dealer installed ac wont be anywhere near as good as factory and the service bums will mess up your car when installing it scratches screwdriver holes in seatsparts not reinstalled correctly or with all the screws etc

i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm dealer for  yearshe said never have a dealer add anything to your car except maybe floormats

how do i square this with a respectable resale value

easy if its expensive  to buy new its gonna be expensive to buy used

 a patently false statement

try this logic on an alfa 

in fact marketplace has a wonderufl mechanism to adjust the value of the cars that are overpriced by the manufacturer

if it is expensive to buy new it is not necessarily expnesive to buy used

in fact it could be real cheap to buy used depending what that car is of course

note that i do not question your statements on the reliability of wrangler

i have never owned one driven one or been in one i do love to have one though

what i dont understand is why this apparent neglect of quality for so many years has not filtered down into the used marketis jeep so intoxicating so irresistable and so seductive as to make its purchase a fatal attraction

 bijan yep

they are popular vehicles

you dont see a lot of previous model year ones sitting on dealers lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are out

the things sell they are popular

because they are popular and highpriced new they are high price used very simple

i knew they were overpriced when i bought it

i knew they had a terrible reliability record when i bought it

but i didnt expect anything like i got especially with a dealer network unable to repair it

personal experience has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine

dave

 there is a special deal where i can get an infinity g fully  loaded at dealer cost i have check this out and the numbers match  up

they are doing this because they are releasing and update mid  version includes dual airbags and want to get rid of their old s is this really the dealers cost

did you get the dealers cost by looking at the invoice

there may be factory to dealer incentives

id check this out since i have trouble believing that a dealer would sell a car to me at his cost

dealer invoice is not necessarily the dealer cost

from weltycabotballtowncmacom richard welty subject recautos frequently asked consumerautomotive questions keywords monthly posting replyto weltyballtowncmacom organization new york state institute for sebastian cabot studies expires thu  may   gmt lines  archivename recautospart this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to miscconsumers

rpw changes as of  april  revised brake fluid section as nonsilicone dot fluids are now apparently available  rpw commonly asked automotive questions tire questions q what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean

a typically you will see something like hr

the  is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower

the  is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width

our example tire has a sidewall height of 

  mm

the  is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like  which is in millimeters

the r means radial and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate

common speed ratings are s mph t mph h mph and v up to mph

recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like r h the  indicates the pertire load associated with the speed rating  exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice

what follows is a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum pertire loads load index          max load kg          note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table

in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car

if no letter is given then the application of the tire is passenger car usage

as far as i know these letters only appear in the us market

the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles

for the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all

if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably  but may be 

tires with an ms mudsnow designation may have their speed rating reduced by  kmh about mph

there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear

temperature and traction are graded a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numeric rating

these values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires

q my car has tires with a funny size designation hr can i put normal tires on the car

a your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin

because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels

you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed

trx type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires

goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires

q can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car

a car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done

the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturers recommendations

q how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy  which end of the car should i put them on

a in short  and both ends

to explain many drivers in areas that dont get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice

with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle

in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end

the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards

radar detectors and speed limits q why arent there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this qa posting

a because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between miscconsumers and recautos

always start long tedious and pointless flame wars

if you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to recautos or altflame and keep it there

safety equipment q do airbags really work

a preliminary statistics suggest the following airbags work much better than no belts good  point belts alone work much better than airbags alone and airbags   point belts work slightly better than  point belts alone

the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the drivers hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult

brake questions q do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned

midas always wants to do this

a no

there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary

if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them

note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly grooved

q they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down

is this really a good idea

a it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes

in modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs

otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings

on the other hand many standard drivers license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i suggest that before taking a us drivers test you either  learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or  borrow a car with an automatic to take the test

q how often should i replace my brake fluid

a probably more often than you do

traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid

dot type are older fluids dot and dot are newer specifications

the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid

dot fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point requirements dot fluids have better boiling point requirements and dot fluids have the best boiling point requirements but dot fluids are not clearly superior see the next qa for more details

while the requirements imply that dot fluids are better than dot fluids there may be specific cases where a dot fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition applications

otherwise dot type fluids offer much improved brake pedal feel

replacement once a year is recommended for dot fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly

q what about dot brake fluids

a this breaks down in to two parts

the dot specification looks excellent for performance but the first dot fluids were silicone based

silicone fluids are a tricky proposition

unlike dot and dot fluids they do not absorb water at all

while this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring

the water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion occurs

because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids

two other issues that come up with silicone fluids  they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and  while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot fluids

silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use

i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot standard that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot and dot fluids but i have little information at this time

q abs is available on some of the cars im looking at but it costs more

is it worth it

a this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons

the short answer is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case

now for the long answer

abs works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes

it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market

it cannot detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup

the sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oeequivalent components

when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system

if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved

this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles

the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system this is about  on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time

unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only audi of the manufacturers producing absequipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality

a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control

this is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release the brakes if it sees steeringtriggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied

braking distances will lengthen accordingly

an important caution abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice dont expect an abs system to help you out very much

the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car

as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions ive listed above you have to worry about the following  parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for  but the oe master cylinder for the absequipped version of the same car lists for over 

most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot silicone brake fluids in absequipped vehicles

because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important

q what about this threshold braking business

a normally id not put this in the consumers qa but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in absequipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is needed here  rpw threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered

basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely

drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal

in many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it

in any case if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit youre not very near the threshold

in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over

recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with abs systems

the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training

there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system

if you think about it for a minute youll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least  so if you cut the  duty cycle of an abs system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason

threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient

gas questions q does high octane gasoline help

a maybe maybe not

some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used

on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well

check your owners manual for details on what your car needs

q my car was made for leaded gasoline

will unleaded gas hurt it

a it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise

the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead

you should however check your owners manual many cars from the early s do not actually require leaded gasoline

q do fuel treatments help

what kind should i use

a some do and some dont

during the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems

never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection

manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owners manual on your car before using these

most manufacturers consider  ethanol acceptable in gasoline

additives with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars

an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job

some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank

there are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the runofthemill ones but work much much better

among these are chevron techron redline sl wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg k a bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommended

q what about detergent gasolines

a the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact

stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations

if such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional

beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits

lubrication questions q what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean

a there are several different items encoded

there is a twoletter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like sesfcd or such

the s codes are for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine applications

the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se se is considered better than sd and so forth

the more noticeable designation is the oil weight

this is either a single number eg  weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w eg w the latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals

the first number in the designation w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the w stands for winter

the second number  is the viscosity of the oil when hot

there is a trick here the oil doesnt actually get thicker turn from  weight to  weight as it gets hotter

what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold  weight oil

as it gets hotter it doesnt get thin as fast as a w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot  weight oil

note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all  weight oils have the same viscosity when hot

note also that the novel behaviour of multigrade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx w oils do not retain their multigrade characteristics well over time

w w and w oils work very well though

q are quick lube places any good

a some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there

let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all times

q are oil additives like slick or tufoil any good

a slick and tufoil are ptfebased additives

many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the molybased additives that have been around since the early s ptfe is the chemical name for teflontm a trademark owned by dupont

in general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products

most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term results whether ptfe additives are effective after k miles are debatable

some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage

some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick  to their cars

this writer has been cautioned by a slick dealer 

that slick should not be used in japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine

otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives

on the other hand there are satified slick  customers in the world

q do synthetic oils really work

a yes but

more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers

auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car

even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils

synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very effective

mobil  synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however

q manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals

how often should i change my oil

a it depends on how you drive

if your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine

if however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at  mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying  mile intervals

if you dont drive your car much at all say  miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway

if you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage

misc

questions q my car has a timing belt

i hear that bad things happen when they break

whats the story

a it depends on the internal design of the motor

early ford escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt

some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be

if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every  miles some cars may require more frequent replacement

ask your dealer or independent mechanic

also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect

replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake

q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks

a for performance reasons

compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles

q what causes unintended acceleration

a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence

the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause

from weltycabotballtowncmacom richard welty subject recautos welcome to to the new reader keywords monthly posting replyto weltyballtowncmacom organization new york state institute for sebastian cabot studies expires thu  may   gmt lines  archivename recautospart most recent changes  march  addition of altautoskarting  rpw  welcome to recautos

 this article is sent out automatically each month and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and some suggested guidelines for discussions

the keywords monthly posting will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities

this article is posted to all autos groups but followups are directed only to recautos

if you dont understand what this means ask your system administrator for help or at least for copies of the newuser documentation

failing that please subscribe to the newsgroup newsannouncenewusers and read the documentation provided there

introduction to the recautos newsgroup hierarchy recautostech is intended for technical discussions of automobiles their design construction diagnosis and service

other discussions are largely inappropriate especially for sale ads

recautossport is intended for discussion of legal organized competition involving automobiles

technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles

discussion from either of two viewpoints spectator and participant is encouraged

arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate as are most other discussions

for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles andor equipment

discussions of illegal events are marginal one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law

remember the fbi reads usenet

recautosdriving is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles

also if you must discuss  vs  or radar detectors or insert your pet driving peeve boneheads do it here

recautosvw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen this includes vws audis seats etc

it was created on the grounds that the infovw mailing list was very successful

it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as a mailing list

recaudiocar is not properly part of the recautos

hierarchy

it is however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so is mentioned here

recautosantique is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than  years old although this is not a hardandfast rule

althotrod is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the recautos reader

it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles

altautosrodncustom also not part of the official hierarchy devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars

altautoskarting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting

recautos is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics

crossposting crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed

crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet

you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience

this distinction is subtle but important

radar detector articles for example are moreorless appropriate in recautos

they are almost never appropriate in scielectronics or rechamradio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in scielectronics or rechamradio is not adequate justification for posting to either group

crossposting between any or all of the recautos

groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your article

consider setting followupto to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost

crossposting between recautos

and miscconsumers is chancy at best in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us andor the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups

most readers of scielectronics and recradio

couldnt care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in recautos

it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followupto lines of articles before posting a followup

in particular be wary of posting to misctest recartsstartrek or talkbizarre or any combination of these three

the life you save may be your own

distribution there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the distribution field

it may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system

the distribution of recautos

is fairly extensive

as of this writing the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some locations in japan

with this in mind i offer the following hints about use of the distribution field in your article headers and on article content

please take care not to send forsale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes mavericks but only door mavericks at that

when posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was manufactured

for example there are a number of differences between a europeanmarket ford escort and a usmarket escort

likewise all cc and early cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers

these differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear

failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation

be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system

a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonlyused abbreviations that may not be known in some places that recautos reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it

use the distribution field to limit where your article goes when possible

within north america the values na north america can canada and usa may be used

in addition the twoletter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases eg

if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put nynj in a distribution field

note that multiple commaseparated values are legal

these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area

the dangers of overgeneralization to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc

what is true for a  buick with a cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a  honda with a cc engine

headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho

the need for adequate specification when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information eg if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc

otherwise most answers to your question may be quite useless

concerning lemons at one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even honda admits to this

please dont waste everyones time by announcing to the world that your brand x automobile is terrible so all brand x automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company

such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information

concerning flames as much as we might wish it a flamefree newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur

here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flameprone topics follows in the next section of this posting if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory dont imagine for a minute that including the words no flames will work

it wont and youll get exactly what you deserve

if youre going to flame youre more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a wellknown reference

no one is likely to believe bald unsupported assertions

be careful about who you choose to insult

consider not insulting anyone

asking the question it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i dont read this group

it is a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there is sufficient interest ill summarize the results in a later posting

i may miss posted responses to this request

answering the question if someone wants to hop up their yugo dont tell them to get a mustang

either be silent or give them useful advice

if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket dont tell them to obey the law next time  its offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and doesnt directly address the original question

in general dont post in order to see your words in print and dont post in order to enjoy feeling smug and selfrighteous

stale andor inflammatory topics certain topics are considered stale by old timers while discussion of them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether

some topics are naturally inflammatory it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them

some of these topics include the following  the mph speed limit in the us pro and con  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detectors

discussions over which radar detector is best

discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why recautossport is not a sports car group  everyone would argue about what constitutes a sports car

disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the drivers right to own and operate a radar detector  buy american discussions  clever bumper stickers and personalized license plates  insert nationality here cars are terrible  what kind of car did maxwell smart drive

when i have a complete accurate answer it will be added to the commonlyasked questions article which is also posted monthly

until then please dont waste bandwidth on this topic

in ifnspoivanzandrewcmuedu jrqandrewcmuedu jason m roth writes rt had an article on cars of the sc ilk and they liked the civic ex the escort gt and the mx best of all and the sc was way down the list except for braking

i just looked at that article first of all this summary is inaccurate of  cars the sc was th right behind these mentioned and the suzuki swift 

as has been pointed out it was a semisilly comparison the saturn was at least  cheaper than the mx and escort admittedly negligible but an issue and  less than the honda

the stated goal was a base under k the honda was  over while the sc at the same price was excluded

in other words they let the best honda play but not the best saturn

note that the saturn did beat the k i dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest assured that the street prices for the mx and escort and maybe even the honda will be lesser than that of the saturn youre talking about

all price comparisons ive seen are based on msrp and of course the saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others will do it way below sticker

srihari id hate to rehash an old thread but would someone kindly quote a prices that a dealer quotes for a civic ex and escort gt

also im a assuming that the mx was the v so go ahead and look that up too

if someone has one of those yearly buyers guides that give a low quote price please quote them too

then find the the sc base price

joestelxonmistelxoncom joe staudt writes in article phoisarmorycenterlinecom jimfcenterlinecom jim frost writes stuff deleted  the silly thing about this whole argument is that most of the trunk releases im tempted to say all but theres bound to be a counterexample only operate if the car is on acc or running

thus you cant easily pop the trunk without starting the car

 most cars

the only cars ive ever seen with this feature have been gm cars

my  mazda  honda and coming soon  probe all have cableoperated releases 

my  camaro had an electric hatch release that was thankfully independent of the key in the ignition the exception to the rule mentioned in my first sentence

 i should probably have said glovebox trunk releases

i havent encountered any glovebox releases that are cable operated

numerous gm and several fordmercury cars that ive encountered have electrical releases in the glovebox and all of the ones ive seen needed the ignition on to some degree to operate

your camaro example is noted but since its a hardtop its not a big deal

ive never run into a convertible with a cableoperated trunk release  id agree  that in such an environment a cable or alwaysactive electrical release would be rather stupid

 jim frost jimfcenterlinecom my honda has a cable release that can be locked out with the ignition key

the valet key can be left with someone and will not unlock the trunk or enable the cable release

i remember my mothers  corvette that had an electronic hatch release located on the drivers door which was always active

the fact that the car had no real trunk makes the security measure of beign able to disable the hatch release unnecessary

from daniel u holbrook dhqandrewcmuedu subject re did us drive on the left

organization carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines  ppqkmnusenetinscwruedu nntppostinghost poandrewcmuedu inreplyto ppqkmnusenetinscwruedu  the reason i ask is because i went to a classic car meet here in the uk and saw a very nice old de soto s vintage id guess with wooden artillery type wheels etc but it was righthand drive

i cant believe that desoto produced rhd cars just for the uk well sweden and australia and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the wrong side of the road so the export market might have been larger then than just the uk

im guessing but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down cattle trails and in wagon ruts

i am fairly sure that placement of the steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time by the s there was a very active good roads movement which had its origins actually in the s during the bicycle craze picked up steam in the teens witness the linclon highway association  or so and the us highway support act real name something different in  that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads

also the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during ww  convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense

anyway by the s there were plenty of good roads at least around urban areas and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside

this was the era after all of the first auto touring fad the motel the auto camp ground etc

two good books on the subject spring to mind  warren belasco america on the road title may not be exact  author is and another called the devil wagon in gods country author i forget

also any of john flinks or john bell raes auto histories

as to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary by the early teens there were virtually no american cars that did not have the wheel on the left

in the early days cars had the wheel on the left on the right and even in the middle as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel

this was standardized fairly early on though i dont know why

we live in south fla so we are definitely in the right are for one

my wife has mentioned the miata but i think it is too small

i would like to wait for the new mustangs  dec

i think

anyone have any opinions on anyall convertibles in a reasonable price range

 thanx the olds supreme convertible got high marks in cds recent test if you can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff

the saab  ragtop may be out of your range but its a good choice

is there a new fcar convertible

the nissan sx convertible is a nice car also those immediately come to mind  chintan amin the university of illinois urbanachampaign mail llamauiucedu neil peart c quick to judge quick to anger slow to understand ignorance and prejudice andfearwalkhandinhand

 id like to get some feedback on a car with most bang for the buck in the  to  price range

im looking for a car with enough civility to be driven every day or even on long trips but when i hit the gas i want to feel some acceleration

handling is important also as are reliability and pretty low maintenance costs

a stylish appearance is nice but i dont want a car that is all show and not much go

even though many of the imports are fast i dont really want a turbo and i never have cared for the song sung by a four clyinder

id prefer a v or v for the engine

if you have any suggestions kevin parker theres only one car that really fits your needs

its spelled 

liter mustang

stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted the mustang is essentially the same deal as the sho  a big power the mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the sho

plant stuck in a midsize sedan with almost no other modifications

i have reallife experience with the mustang  it handles like a brick except when youre invoking oversteer of course something i its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock mustang because of the suspension

personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is inadequate even from mph

lots of accelleration  but the rest of the car is not up to par

yes

when i think mustang i think schoolbus  f motor

in my mind the mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at  or so

it just isnt safe check out your local junkyard mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards

i find it astonishing the cu or somesuchlike has not jumped on the mustang for poor brakes in relation to power

ford should at least standardize on the svo rear brakes for all s

 i picked the porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind

it didnt have to be the   it could have been the much cheaper  or one of several mercedes or audi models

all of these cars are fairly expensive  but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed

this should be elementary

 there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up

my autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but i believe the following to be true  

drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here

true of northern europe latin countries are something else



the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than kindof true

remember they were build by adolf in the s  they are here and usually include animal fences

this makes them  far more predictable than most us highways

yes



not all of europe is the autobahn

most places in europe have autobahn is the german word for freeway

other countries have different names for loose equivalents autostrada autoroute motorway etc

 speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in  the us  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not  much higher than kmh

europe did seem on the brink of a kmh limit

it hasnt passed as far as i know

typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the us

law enforcement is negligible in my experience comapred to the us as there is no revenue enhancement motivation

the things you really notice are the higher speed differentials and the more professional attitude to driving

you just never see two cars running parallel at 

mph oblivious to all around them

 i strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing mph nearly kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong

some people youre wrong

gtis go this fast

just kind of noisy not the ideal autobahn car

a lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor

how do i know

when youre not making any ground on the identical car in front of you

have no respect for their own lives

if something happens at  youre dead but the same goes for much over 

driving at high speed forces you to concentrate

i feel much safer driving  on the autobahn than  in typical us traffic because most people seem to be awake

ive never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn i see it all too often in the us

craig it just doesnt seem fast after  minutes or so of aclimation

everybody drives that fast no big deal

craig  you certainly havent convinced me

  of course not

these arethe numbers i have been stating in the past  messages

it really angers me that you insisted you were right and that you had no clue what your own car weighed

why didnt you check when i first told you that your figures were implausible

   i am giving every chance to retract figures widely known

the mustang is  rated at 

is 

you have a hp advantage over a mustang   seems that the  mustang 

is rated at  hp only because ford  changed its testing procedures

under the older procedures it still  rates closer to  hp

that means that the mustang has  hp more

 id like to hear a better explanatin of how you come to that conclusion from the above data

  big threat

you are kod by a civic acording to cd   yeah sure in your wet dreams

and thats probably where you got no sorry your wrong again

you quoted the del sol as doing  in

interestingly the stealth es which is faster than your rt does the samerun in

kind of embarassing isnt it

why didnt you check the figures before posting

it only makes you look stupid when you are caught out twice with your own figures

 that 

second  for the stealth

   ill check cds  issue

strange that you claim to have that you really should have checked

  go ahead and check asshole youll realize what an idiot you are for not  checking data beforeposting

  for  posts now youve been harping on this may  issue of car  driver   without posting any numbers

why not

because they prove me right and you  aint got the guts to admit it

yeah thought so

 if you insist i gave you every chance to retract but dodge stealth es auto does an 

wonder why you couldnt find it

do you realize that a k sentra cd will run a  that a sentra ser or saturn will run in the s

dont you think it is kind of strange that your hp sports car is so easily beaten

a mustang  which weights about the same according to your numbers has less power and is much quicker

care to explain

dont be abusive just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those hp went to its a mystery to me

 the sentra ser really is alot quicker than the hp fwd sports car

 you are close to the k sentrae

go look up the numbers in cd  and  report please

  no im going to play your game    no way sentras are slow

i took a test drive and it took  

to go

of course shooting someone because they throw a rock at your car is out of the question but what if they disabled your car with their rock and then wanted to come killraperobbeat or otherwise harm you your wife kids

i think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation wouldnt you

or is it that you value the lives of such rock throwers more than your own or those of your family

dont think it couldnt happen to you

from the sounds of it here it has happened to a few people

please do not misunderstand

the only justification for using deadly force on someone is that if you dont it will mean your own death or grave bodily harm

i just visited the ny auto show and saw two lh cars on the floor eagle vision and dodge intrepid

 really nice i must say

very attractive styling lots of features and room at a competitive price

 unfortunately the workmanship is quite disappointing

on both cars the rubber seals around the window and door fell off

it turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber band

it goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door frame

surely it would come off easily

lack of build quality was the thing i notced on the first  lhs i saw months back

the panel gaps were large and nonuniform between the  cars i saw  the kind of thing you expect and accept on a mustang  but not from chryslers savior

if i were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential i would be the stupid one

just to satiate my curiosity why would this make you the stupid one

it seems to me everybody should be aware enough of what is going on

you do not need i couldnt agree more

that is how it should work

people should also always see motorcycles too

i constantly scan behind me i have one of those wink mirrors and two outside mirrors

i actually spend just as much time checking my six cops you know

i still get caught off guard every now and then

maybe i didnt word it right the first time

what i was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very high speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you you are stupid of course it depends on the circumstances

i have had some very scary instances when i assumed this and i dont think all of the fault was the other guy now if he was going  in a  thats a whole different story

in article conradiefirgasunacza conradiefirgasunacza gerrit conradie writes    however if i were to design a bmws electronics i will use a counter to count the number of times the car passed  million miles or whatever and store it in the car computers memory

this could be read when doing a diagnostics test

ditto for the date of the odometer

as easy as this is i dont know why manafucturers dont do it dont they

to prevent illegal odometer tampering

 but as a previous writer said it will in any case take aeons to reset an odometer mechanic or electronic by simulating a driving car

it will be easier to reprogram it

how i dont know

 it shouldnt be that hard if you know much about digital electronics

if the counter is made with standard ttl chips all you should need to do is find the chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh youd also have to know what the conventions are for low and high

it might be a little more involved than this but it shouldnt be beyond someone with a bsee or bs eet

all the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using a translation table stored in rom

 selah  dan  but those chips are probably inside a custom chip to make it smaller and use less power and the presetdata pins are not going to be available

it would probably not be ttl but might be cmos wider operating voltage range not that the tecnology would make much difference

plus the custom chip would probably be potted encapsulated with epoxy

 the biggest hurdle for automatics imho is not shifting speed  per se but rather the transmissions reaction speed when you  try to force it to shift manually

  i rented an oldsmobile achieva is that a yuppie name or what

and a nissan stanza

they both had automatics

im a manual transmission bigot but i have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were better shifters than i am

and yes they responded very quickly to kickdown requests

the nissan had a tachometer so i was able to figure out which gear i was in

the olds may have also but i dont remember

i believe it shifted all the way down to second at about  mph when my foot told it no i really want to accelerate quickly

i would still prefer a manual but i wont delude myself into thinking that i can outaccelerate a modern automatic

and im very smooth at shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic

anything i should specifically ask abt

jj brakes cluthch etc

i noticed on the drive the clutch engagemen jj point seemed a little high since all my other cars are autotragics jj im not sure abt this point

i had my foot firmly planted on the jj brake when i started it up

there was a bit of a pop in the pedal jj soon after the engine started

this also occured on a few tbird sc jj i test drove

was this the abs self test

brake rotors and the clutch are the main things

there has been a clutch replacement program you might check to see if the car is still eligible as it is a change well worth making

you can also swap the cruddy cable shifter for the newer rod shifter also a change worth making but thatll cost you some 

my brakes usually do one wibblewobble on startup so that is probably normal

didnt know they had a selftest thats interesting

i dont have figures on average property tax in the us or how much of it is allocated for housing projects inferior public schools jails or the like but i have a feeling that the amount the government steals from an honest productive citizen to breed this trash is significantly less than the value of many automobiles

 one i saw had vented rears tooit was on a lot

of course the sales man was a fooltitanium wheelsyeah right then later told me they were magnesiummore believable but still crap since al is so m uch cheaper and just as good  i tend to agree tho that this still doesnt take the sho up to standard for running  on a regular basis

the brakes should be bigger like  or sotake a look at the ones on the corradoswhere they have braking regulations

 well lets seemy tbird sc has a computercontrolled adjustable suspension wheel abs disks  vented front

 is that up to standard

if not why not

  james james i really hate to do this but try reading the damn posts

never was a tbird mentioned

the discussion was about shos and stangs not being up to spec

i do not know about tbirds

i only know that the specs quoted for the sho by previous poster sounded a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff

this does not in any way disencourage me from wishing to own one nor does it make it a bad car

it merely means that i think ford could have added that extra bit of safety and tossed in larger brakes as the wheels are plenty large enough for them to fit if memory serves right which it may very well not and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it

from michalcscmuedu michal prussak subject illegal tint windows nntppostinghost gsspcscmuedu organization school of computer science carnegie mellon lines  i know its a long shot but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share

the story is this i bought a car out of state and im trying to get the safety inspection in pennsylvania

the problem is that the car has aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield

the tint is rather weak and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint

the inspection garage said that they wont pass it unless i get a waiver from the state police

so i went to the state police  the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal and i can get a waiver only for a pre car or for a medical reason

i asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says its illegal

he showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you cant have tint if you cant see the inside of the car because of the tint

when i told him that you can in fact see the inside very well he shut the book and said its just illegal and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now

well wont argue with that

since the vehicle code says its ok as long as you can see through the tint id like to keep it ill reread the vehicle code in the library

id also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says its ok so i can get the inspection and so that i wont get in trouble for the tint later on

i also wouldnt mind registering a complaint against that officer  he really pissed me off

so does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police especially in pennsylvania

does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer

i called the station later on today but they basically said there is no place where i could register a complaint against an officer and if i do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway how much of a chance do i stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court

any comments about it will be welcome

at mph  that is quite a small reaction time

but of course we are too macho to  think we are invincible and can react faster than that only the poor  sod who you didnt see might not have a normal life ever  i worked out the reaction time in a previous post and its plenty even for an  year old grandma as long as speeds are in the  mph range or less

if you or some other driver is going way faster than that then be careful

 as always you are responsible for your driving actions

if you pull out to pass and crash into someone for whatever reason its your fault

if you cant problem is that i may just kill the guy

i agree that i would be at fault and i will have my license revoked why i might even go to the gas chamber

but the fact still remains that the guy is dead

someone died because i was too stingy to put on my lights

see a damn thing then you shouldnt be driving  lights fail fallen trees or rocks dont have lights etc

i maintain that headlight strength the ratio of the probability of fallen treesrocks on the roads to oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered

the difference is also working on what we know could happen to what might happen

running lights are not necessary for motorists who drive around mph

it may be a good idea to force the running or headlights on when you turn your windshield wipers on but only because some people are too stupid to do so

if you crash into one of those idiots you have to fight it out in court to show his neglegence if you can even prove it

 just out of curiosity how much gasmilage do you loose when you put  your lights on

and how much do you reduce the life of your headlamps

 and what is the cost of your headlamps anyway

 mileage is certainly reduced but by a very very small amount probably about  watts for head and running lights

this is an extra  horsepower that must be made by the engine

it may be that this will cost you around two gallons a year

but times  million cars thats a lot of gas

compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those  million cars it is miniscule

whatever tis a pity i have to share the same roads with a person not concerned with safety

s ssaveolecdaccom lamp life is measured in hours

so if you normally drive in half daylight and half night your lamps will have to be replaced twice as often

headlamps only cost about us for most halogen lamps

 the cost to the individual is trivial and to me is not the issue

what i dont like is the distractions all these cars with headlights cause

i dont need to constantly see the headlights of the vehicle behind me

i dont need to see the headlights of every gosh darn car for a mile down the road

these lit up cars make nonilluminated things less visible like pedistrians and bikes

hopefully were not going to mandate drls for people and bikes too

 a stream of taillights is tolerable as are the orange front running lights

this is certainly sufficient for other people to see you if they look and doesnt distract me nearly as much as full power headlights

 i have had two wranglers and still have the second right now

its a   wrangler base model with the big i l engine hard top no  power steering or air conditioning

runs like a top

has about k on  it

has never been in the shop

i can change my own oil nice tall  vehicle

i can lube it myself  fittings

i occasionally take it to  jiffy lube to check the differentials and do the oil change there

  my previous wrangler had nary a problem either

here in colorado there  more jeeps than bmws mercedes volvos and the like together

in fact  jeep has been called the colorado car for a while

they hold their value  well and are very easy to resell

mine cost right around k new

of  course i didnt blow money on an islander sahara or renegade which  i have a  wrangler sahara and paid 

new including the rebate

 are just wranglers with fancy inside stuff

 after driving a cj for  years that fancy stuff is pretty nice

  the cars are primitive ride like a dump truck etc

but if you live in  an area that gets around  of snow per winter youd have one too

 theyll go anywhere with a winch and are easy to get parts for

the  i like my wrangler but when doing some serious off roading it cant keep up with a cj because of ground clearance and limited suspension travel

i do have a winch and would like to get an arb airlocker in the future

 l engine puts out  hp and gets around mpg

not bad

i love the    just my experience

im sure there are bad ones out there but that goes  for any make and model

 wasnt the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver so he could see where he was backing up

although reverse lights on the sides no

reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up

they arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail lights

are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the path of the car i dont think warnings were their original intents since they are colored white

well red and orange were already taken

maybe white defines the direction that the car is moving in

if you really want to be able to see behind you get some fog lamps for the back of the car

these work very well  and are a good way to get rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone

subject dealer cheated me with wrong odometer reading

need help

here is a story

i bought a car about two weeks ago

i finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car

in between  and  the instrument pannel of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero

therefore the true meter reading is the reading before replacement plus current mileage

that shows  mile difference comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from

the dealer never told me anything about that important story

 i hope that i can return the car with full refund

do u think this is possible

does anyone have similar experiences

any comments will be appreciated

thanks

something that happened in south africa about a year ago a dealer sold a mercedes with an odometer reading of k kilometers to a lady

turned out that the actual reading should have been k court case followed because lady said she wouldnt have bought a car with that much kms

dealer found quilty fined and had to take back the car

i think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous owner

take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something

gerrit

no

at six years you are nearing the end of the design life of the vehicle when everything should be breaking

at that point the driving habits make more difference than the actual reliability of the vehicle so the data becomes unreliable for drawing conclusions bad driving habits can damage a car in a couple of months not  years

if that were not the case everyone would be driving fleet rental resolds and while you are considering things factors in stat terms how about city vs highway driving ratios owner vs dealer service extreme weather or environment adherence sp

rt had an article on cars of the sc ilk and they liked the civic ex the escort gt and the mx best of all and the sc was way down the list except for braking

i just looked at that article first of all this summary is inaccurate of  cars the sc was th right behind these mentioned and the suzuki swift 

as has been pointed out it was a semisilly comparison the saturn was at least  cheaper than the mx and escort admittedly negligible but an issue and  less than the honda

the stated goal was a base under k the honda was  over while the sc at the same price was excluded

in other words they let the best honda play but not the best saturn

note that the saturn did beat the k i dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest assured that the street prices for the mx and escort and maybe even the honda will be lesser than that of the saturn youre talking about

all price comparisons ive seen are based on msrp and of course the saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others will do it way below sticker

subject is car saftey important

 i was recently thumbing through the  lemonaid new car guide

what i found was a car would be given a recommended under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision

the most highly recommended small car the civic has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed

there were many such cases of great vehicles where you wouldnt survive an accident

is it only me or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car

 definitely

safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car

i wont buy a small car like a civic or whatever

great  safety  handling  speed  for me seems to me that you would be more dead in a small car than a large car after an accident

i am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure we are compliant with the regulations

the trouble with regulations is that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do not what you should do instead

i think the cause of the new regulations is the montreal protocol which has a definite cfcphaseout schedule

of course the cause of the montreal protocol was all the research done on the causes of the ozone depletion problem

someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozonedepleting cfc chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhousegasproducing compounds

the greenhouse effect produced by infraredtrapping gasses like co and methane and the ozonehole problem produced by longlived chlorinecontaining molecules are not the same thing

it is a lot easier to do something about not using the cfcs chlorofluorocarbons than it is to stop producing co and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living animal organisms

planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhousegas problem but would do nothing for the ozone problem

this all happened last  saturday

   i have heard that there is a coolingoff law allowing me three days  to reconsider the contract

is this true

can anyone point me to the  law

the transaction happened at the dealership if it matters

  this cooling off period applies only in certain situations  lik ewhen  you are solicited at home

i also think the cooling off period ends  if you actually accept the merchandise

  if this were not the case any car buyer would have the right to return  a slightly used highly devalued car  days after buying it

yeah   thats the trick  if i want to buy a new car id have a firend buy   return one then go in and negotiate a better deal on a preowned  used car

however if you agree some terms and then when about to sign the dealer slips you a contract with different terms and leads you to believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to that is fraud

there is no  day limit on restitution for fraud

 in article aprcbnewslcbattcom prmcbnewslcbattcom paulrmount writes  in your experience how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning will do much more good than just using detergent gas

while i   a fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than  them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner  and sending you on your merry way  poorer

go to kmart and buy the  cleaner yourself for 

this should not be the case if they are at all reputable

fuel injector cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure

the car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process

the equipment to properly do this is pricey and generally not something the average home mechanic has

the solvent itself is not very expensive  and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself but i didnt tell you that  not many intank cleaners are worth wasting your money on

there has been a discussion of these products on here from time to time and chevron techron not progard with techron is generally regarded as the best

it is however a bit more than 

a bottle

imho it will not substitute for proper injector cleaning if they are really crudded up

youll have to decide if the  price is a better deal than spending your time andor buying equipment to do it

bijan

if im not mistaken altering the odometer is illegal

furthermore i surmise itll be tough to alter bmws odometer if you got at it

some of the newer bmws have electronic odometers making it even more tamperproof

on the cars mentioned   series from the late s the electronic odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer that is driven by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle

these pulses are converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer  and speedometer

no way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading

it also means the odometer is just as easy or hard to change as any other mechanical odometer

on the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer readinga simple switch will do the job

it also will disable the speed limiter which will enable the car to reach its full speed

 ok how about this to argue about

why does the sl have a much lower base price than the sc

its over k cheaperi forget the exact amount

doesnt it cost more to have the extra doorswindowslocksmotors etc

that are in the  door

perhaps it is just a marketing dealpeople want the door so they will pay the extra k

ok heres what i understand the slslslswsw was meant to compete with the following cars honda civic toyota tercel slsl toyota corolla slsl nissan sentra mazda protoge subaru loyaleimpreza isuzu stylus geo prizm ford escort mercury tracer mistubishi mirage plymouthdodge colt their core competition is the civic corolla and sentra

most of the other models are in the same class but arent the first cars you would think of

i threw in the escorttracer because it has a good amount of japanese technology and has similar reliability stats

i didnt include domestic small cars such as the cavalier sunbird shadow sundance tempo and topaz since i think saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of japanese roots

the scsc was meant to compete against the following cars toyota paseo honda civic sicivic coupesdel sol si nissan nxnx mazda mx isuzu impulse geo storm ford escort gt if you look at the prices of these cars theyre more expensive than theyre door counterparts

the is good reason for this

it is a more upscale and trenddriven market

even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms their interior etc

is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices

here are some of the platform derivations i can think of tercel  paseo sentra  nxnx civic  del sol   mx not sure on this one stylus  impulsestorm to illustrate a tercel starts at around  while the paseo starts at around 

even a door tercel will cost less than a door paseo

now you might be saying that the tercel doesnt offer the power that some doors offer

what i mean is that there is no dr tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative

lets take another example the isuzu stylus xs and impulse xsstorm gsi

both have the same powerplants a l hp engine but the smaller dr coupes are generally more expensive

again this is because the twodoor sport coupe market is a more fashionoriented and trendsetting segment

people are willing to pay more money for this type of car

in short even though the scsc may be smaller hence less car its market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan slsl version

from cfclevelandfreenetedu chunhung wan subject nx vs sentra ser organization case western reserve university cleveland oh usa lines  replyto cfclevelandfreenetedu chunhung wan nntppostinghost helainscwruedu im plannig to trade my sentra ser in with a nx

my car has  miles on it and is a  model

the nx the dealer is selling is a  model with miles on it

it has a tbar roof ac and an airbag which my sentra does not have

they are asking for 

is that a fair deal

the only thing i noticed about the nx is that the engine did not seem to have as much torque as my sentra which has the same identical engine

i presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine to its limits occassionaly while i did that on mine thuis the nxs engine is a little tight

so if i buy the nx and excercise it well should that slight power problem go away

any advice on this will be much appreciated

thanks

that is not to say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick eg disabled persons but they arent in any position to use an sho anyway

 i would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all performancetype cars like the l mustangs camaros and the like wed cut down on the number of accidents each year

autos are fine for sedate little sedans but they have no business in performance cars imho

  james  i have to disagree with this

i have a  z with a  and a speed auto w overdrive and it is really better that way

chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power

i live in the dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic here

now if i still lived out in the sticks like i used to a manual would be more fun

 safetywise an auto is less distractingi would hate to have to be shifting gears while i was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here

performancewise i can hold my own against any stock 

mustang or 

camaro w a five speed

 all of this imho  all of my hos disagree with your hos

i loved dallas rush hour in my stick detested it in the autolike i did any other time in the auto of course dalls rush hours are nothing from what i hearif i lived in la i might be of a different persuasion

and just for the record rarely do you shift gears when merging into trafficthat is what  speeds are good forth is good up through around  most of the time so you can just wind it out its not going to hurt anything and keeps it in the powerband anyway only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in thfairly rare unless you drive a ferrari or some such id bet or when you hit cruising speed where you feel comfortableor when my mother is sitting in the passanger seat complaining about how you wind her poor little engine way too hi  just my hos drew

there is no question that the valentine  has good range but not significant enough to be  or  times as expensive as some of the others

the big win with the v is not its range but rather its directionality and multipletransmitter tracking which you later called a gimmick  a conclusion i disagree with

since the detector incorporates multiple receivers its not surprising that its significantly more expensive

while the added capabilities may not help you there is added value for those of us who live in areas where there are a lot of falsealarms

summary valentine way too expensive and not a significantly better performer

i certainly call it interesting but im another person who thinks that the added value might be coming at too high a cost

very adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and one of them has suited me rather well

if i did more longdistance travelling in areas im not familiar with id probably consider getting the v because its additional information would be useful in discriminating false alarms

boylecactusorg craig boyle writes the quality of autobahns is something of a myth

the road surface isnt much different to a typical tx freeway

they are better in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc

 they light the highways in texas

funny everywhere else ive been they only light em at junctions

sorry by they i meant autobahns not us freeways

 i wont even get into how much road markings vary between states and localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are essentially nonexistant

 than most of the roads here

a dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at  will kill you at 

dont get me wrong i love to  it would have to be quite severe

i dont recall any us freeway without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe at  in any decent well damped car

 i suspect you have very limited experience  us freeways vary dramatically particularly between states

i can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where  would be very optimistic in any car

well ive driven in every state but alaska and drive about k per year

i take long cross country trips any chance i get  its fun for me and i can get reimbursment

my job allows me to drive rather than fly

not to labor the point but ive driven just about every freewayin the us germany uk and france plus some in mexico which was surpisingly good

 im not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations but i suspect every single bridge junction on i through ct would be considered so

theyre hard to take at mph

thats not the only interstate ive seen with such deviations but its one i drive frequently

yes but as a age of the total freeway in the us

all you have to do in this case is mark the hazard advising people to slow to  or so

 texas is pretty much an edgecase  you cant assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such texas freeways are varied sometimes a good surface

mostly flat

but i in ca is comparable and hilly

wideopen spaces

it just aint so

 given the absence of other traffic and car built for  eg

most us freeways are just fine

the problem is other road users and cops

jim frost jimfcenterlinecom craig

so is cocaine

whats your point

that neither is harmful when used carefully

 their problem i wasnt giving them any more money

the finance guy then brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time

i reminded him that i was the customer and i didnt think i should be treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole deal

he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it snatched back my check and left

needless to say they were not pleased by the turn of events

thats nothing

when a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldnt give her the bimbo treatment

her first choice was a mazda  and second choice was a nissan sentra

we went to a mazda dealership and described what we wanted

we started negotiating on the price and the salesdroid kept playing the let me run this price by the sales manager

after playing the good salesman bad salesman game we finally told him that if he didnt have the authority to negotiate a price perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did

he brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book

read remar suttons dont get taken every time for a list

finally after playing a few more rounds of youll have to work with us on this price also known as each time you come up a thousand dollars well come down ten the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies stood up and said well we cant come down any more so i guess we cant help you and they trouped out of the room leaving us sitting in the salesmans office all by ourselves

hmm

id read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer and i mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door

for lack of anything better to do i picked up the phone on the desk and called another mazda dealership asked for a salesman and began discussing what kind of price they would consider

a few sentences into the conversation mr salesmanager broke into the line 

and began telling me how rude he thought it was that i would call another dealership from his phone

i said that since hed announced that our business was over he shouldnt care and every time i tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own

how did he know that i was using the phone anyway

finally i hung up and we headed out of the showroom

sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again

we say that we wont bother him anymore were going next door to the nissan dealership

then comes the part i wish i could have videotaped

as we go out the front door the sales manager shouts across the entire showroom customers and all go ahead

you deserve to buy a nissan

so my friend bought a sentra

just so the guilty wont go unpunished ill mention that the sales managers name was gary tusone

from his manner his refusal to come down to a reasonable price and his anger at the end my guess is that he had bet our original salesman who was a young novice that hed be able to get at least x dollars out of us and he was steamed that we wouldnt fall for his slimy tricks

why anyone would order an sho with an automatic transmission is beyond me if you cant handle a stick you should stick with a regular taurus and leave the sho to real drivers

that is not to say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick eg disabled persons but they arent in any position to use an sho anyway

actually disabled persons have been known to drive in scca races

id be careful about making sweeping generalizations here

id prefer a manual transmission but the early sho had an awful transmission that felt like it came out of a truck or something

it was almost enough to make me want an automatic

would the fact that  i mainly drive the other car lower it

is there some type of classic  car or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under k miles  per year

   my dad has a  vette and its on what you say classic insurance

 basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving  time which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would  probably suit your needs for limited mileage

   in my area denver if you look around alittle you can get an  for  or less not much less

you said your not looking to go fast they are a really nice car just not real powerful in addition to restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also require that the vehicle be garaged when not in use

 if a car is good enough to create a passionate and loyal following there  must be something really extraordinary about it

 so all you land crusher cultists  here is your chance to convert me

    jonathan edwards edwardsintranetcom  intranet inc  based on my experience with a  fj  the hardtop jeepstyle model  i would definitely give a new model consideration if i were in the market

the older models are very well built

unless toyota lost its mind i would assume until proven otherwise that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors

two major differences in the running gear that im aware of need study

my  has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension

the solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model but only experience will tell

the independant front suspension is no doubt a compromise made to satisfy the typical user who will never need a real utility vehicle

the second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models

im not sure but i think tioyota went to a fulltime wd or allwheel drive system

the older landcruisers have a lockup type

both have their advantages and disadvantages

it generates as much excitement as two nerds challenging each other in a game of oneonone basketball

 the sl does  in about 

 note that this is closer to a  than to a paseo or storm pseudosporty cars

thats a ridiculous comparison i know but the point is that saturns and highend civics for that matter accelerate just fine in fact better than most unimproved muscle cars of the s  hp is great but tied to  tons it just doesnt go that quick

saturns on the other hand use  hp tied to  lbs with some short gearing to move very quickly off the line

apologies if this is a faq is there a faq posting for this group

i am an infrequent reader of recautos so i cant remember

 i am in the market for a used chevy suburban and have observed that prices for models with diesel engines run about  less than comparable models with a gas engine

 there has to be a reason for this

 yes there is consumer confusion

in the early s with the fuel crisis etc everyone wanted better fuel mileage

diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines

so gm decided to conver their  gas engine into a diesel engine i think was a 

liter

big mistake

the engine was not redesigned but converted

the engine could not handle the higher compression etc

lots of problems with these cars

this thew up a big red flag to the casual observer  dont buy a diesel

they are bad

this was a gross generalization

ask yourself this question  if your livelihood depended on driving lots of it would you use a dependable or undependable but cheaper in the short run vehicle

what do greyhound busses have in them

trailer trucks

even train locomotives

are these gasoline engines

no they are diesel

tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a  mile warrantee with they vehicles

i own an  diesel suburban

the l diesel is a great engine

just keeps going

it was more expensive when new than the gasoline engine vehicle was

the only problem with diesel engines is that when they need to be rebuilt they are expensive

in a gas  engine you will pay about  for a rebuild

diesel l is about 

but then again the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about  better mileage

a carburator for a gasoline engine costs about  to rebuild or less

a rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about  or more

but then again you never need a tuneup

if youre looking at a rebuilt l id say you got a great deal

check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also

good luck

 they are pretty much junk stay away from them

they will be replaced next  year with all new models

junk

theyve made the cd lists for years due to their excellent handling and acceleration

they have been around since about oh  or  so theyre not the newest on the lot and mileage is about five to eight mpg under the class leader

from aaspocwruedu andrew a spencer replyto aaspocwruedu andrew a spencer organization case western reserve university cleveland oh usa nntppostinghost slcinscwruedu lines  in a previous article dhqandrewcmuedu daniel u holbrook says im guessing but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down cattle trails and in wagon ruts

i am fairly sure that placement of the steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time  by the s there was a very active good roads movement which had its origins actually in the s during the bicycle craze picked up steam in the teens witness the linclon highway association  or so and the us highway support act real name something different in  that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads

also the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during ww  convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense

anyway by the s there were plenty of good roads at least around urban areas and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside

this was the era after all of the first auto touring fad the motel the auto camp ground etc

two good books on the subject spring to mind  warren belasco america on the road title may not be exact  author is and another called the devil wagon in gods country author i forget

also any of john flinks or john bell raes auto histories

im sorry as i have never heard of any of this

guess they dont think its important enough for a classroom and i was going on what ive seen in picssome moviesreal nice scource there huh

i just always recall thinking that good roads of asphalt didnt come around til the interstate hiway act or whatever they called its and that wood and cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression except in overpopulated places like england and us cities

obviously netwisdom says i am wrong

as to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary by the early teens there were virtually no american cars that did not have the wheel on the left

in the early days cars had the wheel on the left on the right and even in the middle as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel

this was standardized fairly early on though i dont know why

i knew it was almost always done but i knew of no reason that it might not be done the other way by desoto for their car

seems like they had some other deviations from the norm too at times  dan dhqandrewcmuedu carnegie mellon university applied history  world history strides on from catastrophe to catastrophe whether we can comprehend and prove it or not

while i agree that a clogged fuel injector would darken my day how clogged do they get and is  a good price or can i do it myself by buying a can of  what

and doing  what

  a fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner and sending you on your merry way  poorer

go to kmart and buy the cleaner yourself for 

personally i wouldnt use the 

product from kmart

i knew about this previously but this past weekend on pbss motorweek pat goss their resident tech type discussed these products and recommends not using them ie the nonisopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners

supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors

and although the others ethyl based do clean injectors they also cause rubber components in the fuel system to deteriorate and they dont mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system

i use a product recommended by vw called k by bg products inc

it cost more about  but it is supposed to do the job without the potential harmful side effects and its results are supposed to last from k to k miles

i have also used chevrons techtrolene sp

i cant say that i have noticed any difference using either since i only use these product as a preventative maintenance item

 just because you dealer sez you need it dont mean its necessarily so

moreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by  then their cars will be even better deals

say if the price of a saturn was already  below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be  below market average

it will  attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money

 force the competitors to lower their prices to survive

but what is saturns motivation here

theyre already selling every car they make with multiple shifts in the plant

given this what possible motivation could they have to lower prices

the gap was quite small on the left side but much larger on the right

blech

mark

compare either to the porsche  and you tell me which was designed  oh right

only  dollar cars should be driven fast

they drive goddamn rabbits at  mph in europe pal and i reckon a taurus is at least as capable as a rabbit

my whole point was not to say that the cars couldnt go that fast but that they shouldnt go that fast

a family sedan designed to be operable at mph doesnt suddenly become operable at mph because you added some plastic aero effects slightly wider tires and a much larger engine

thats what the sho is  a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine

they didnt even bother improving the brakes

the mustang is essentially the same deal as the sho  a big power plant stuck in a midsize sedan with almost no other modifications

i have reallife experience with the mustang  it handles like a brick except when youre invoking oversteer of course something i personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is inadequate even from mph

lots of accelleration  but the rest of the car is not up to par

i picked the porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind

it didnt have to be the   it could have been the much cheaper  or one of several mercedes or audi models

all of these cars are fairly expensive  but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed

this should be elementary

there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up

my autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but i believe the following to be true 

drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here



the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than they are here and usually include animal fences

this makes them far more predictable than most us highways



not all of europe is the autobahn

most places in europe have speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in the us  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not much higher than kmh

i strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing mph nearly kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong

some people have no respect for their own lives

you certainly havent convinced me

 of course not

in article cvirlrshuksandsboeingcom freddshuksan fred dickey writes  carolinafanuiuc ckauxacsouiucedu wrote     the biggest problem some people seem to be having is that saturn   dealers make k on a car

i think most will agree with me that the car is   comparably priced with its competitors that is they arent overpriced   compared to most cars in their class

i dont understand the point of   arguing over whether the dealer makes the k or not

  i have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either

 the only thing that i can figure out is that people believe that if  they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket  expenses for the car

while this may be true in some cases i do not  believe that it is generally true

i bought a saturn sl in january of 

 at that time based on studying car prices i decided that there was  no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the saturn

sure maybe i  could have talked the price for some other car to the saturn price but  my outofpocket expenses wouldnt have been any different

whats important  to me is how much money i have left after i buy the car

reducing dealer profit  is not the same thing as saving money

show me how reducing dealer profit  saves me money and ill believe that its important

my experience has  been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money

  fred say you bought your saturn at k with a dealer profit of k

if the dealer profit is  then you would only be paying k for the same car

so isnt that saving money

yes

but the point is that prices are competetive

saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a  profit but since a comperable honda with  profit is more expensive it may be well worth it to buy the saturn

moreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by  then their cars will be even better deals

say if the price of a saturn was already  below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be  below market average

it will  attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money

  force the competitors to lower their prices to survive

now not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyers for other cars will pay less

not necessarily

it seems to me that saturn salesdroids who dont make a commision whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do make more  per hour or whatever

this means that saturn doesnt give up the profit to their employees through commision which is taken out of per car profits

they just pass it along to less pressureing salesmenwomen

isnt that saving money

maybe

maybe not

depends on accounting practices

id rather pay more for dealer service that doesnt cut corners to contain costs

get into an  mph accident and you may reconsider

ive been in one and it is really scarey

my life is something i value more than a cars looks or handeling

consider it insurance it may not happen often but when it does youll sure be glad you got a safe car

granted the tests arent perfect but id much rather be in a car that did well in the test than a car that did horribly

you raise a valid point but again its a tradeoff  how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection

you could buy a volvo saab or benz and get really good crash protection and other luxuries but youll pay significantly more for it

in my case its out of the question because all of those cars are beyond my budget

even in highspeed headon collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old point seatbelt

nowadays at least in the us you get an airbag if you get a point belt so presumably you get an added safety benefit there as well

thats something i certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars

you get more horsepower  torque too

if you dont know what hp  torque are you can read mile long threads on the subject but they are all wrong

horsepower is how much power a horse can make pulling a subaru and torque is a name invented by craftsman for a wrench

a in the us currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors

new york prohibits their use in large trucks

in canada they are illegal in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island

they are apparently are illegal through most if not all of europe

legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal

q where are radar detector detectors used

do they really work

a usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in canada but now they are appearing in new york and virginia

it is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and dc

they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted

new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors

note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on

q what is vascar

is it some kind of radar

a vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and timespeeddistance computer

it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks

no radar signals are emitted by a vascar system

q what is ka band radar

where is it used

should a radar detector be able to handle it

a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in socalled photoradar installations

in these installations a lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a  degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit

tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle

because of the low power and the  degree angle many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway

the number of locales where photoradar is in use is limited and some question the legality of such units

best advice learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they are used or else dont speed

q do radar jammers work

are they legal

a quick answer no and not in the usa

detailed answer cheap radar jammers do not work well at all

jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military

jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the federal communications commission of the usa

driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions q what are understeer and oversteer

a understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion that is

most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter

simply put they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer

understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast wont get into trouble

understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner

oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing throttle oversteer or tto

in extreme cases lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning

some technical details in a corner at speed the tires on the car will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel

in understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels

in oversteer the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels

q what is a revmatched downshift

a when downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear

however during a downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop rather than increase

in revmatched downshift you blip the throttle before reengaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed

this results in a much smoother and faster downshift

q what does heelandtoe mean

a heelandtoe is a technique used to do a revmatched downshift while braking

this is normally challenging because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle

it is called heelandtoe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift

in many modern cars this is a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle

note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing the same thing

q what is doubleclutch downshifting

a while your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of three things nothing declutch once or declutch twice

the reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine

this is usually coupled with revmatching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up

the procedure is as follows  declutch  move gearshift lever to neutral  engage clutch  match revs  declutch  move gearshift lever to next lower gear  engage clutch this sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural

the problem that doubleclutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox

in transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros doubleclutching makes it much easier to shift

basically if you doubleclutch well you are not using the synchros at all

this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition

q what do the numbers for acceleration from   mile skidpad and slalom times in the auto magazines really mean

may they be compared

a in short  not as much as the magazines want you to believe and  almost never

in more detail the acceleration numbers mph and  mile times in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source

testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a road  track number to a car  driver number is quite pointless

keep in mind too that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the major part of the equation

skidpads vary and even if they didnt skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically when tire compounds change

do not make any assumptions about the comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers

this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however

skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools

they are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires

slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the automobiles transient response

however they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the cars envelope

they do not tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision

for example they dont tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes offcamber

when a car has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving

the list of caveats could go on for page after page

q my buddy claims that wide tires dont make any difference according to his freshman physics textbook and that you cant ever accelerate or corner at more than g

does he know what hes talking about

a  in short he hasnt got a clue

in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth dry and nondeformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature

pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent

tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over

in a tire at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term

the colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually reverting to liquid which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking

this latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving so unless youre a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving dont worry about it

because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters accelerate at more than g and race cars corner and brake at more than g

because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip

an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism

questions q what does name or acronym stand for

a here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net

in particular never ask in rechumor if you want a useful result

saab svenska aeroplan a

b or the swedish airplane corporation alfa societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat fabbrica italiana di automobili torino or the italian automobile manufacturers of turin bmw bayerische motoren werke or bavarian motor works mg morris garage q does vw own porsche

a no

porsche is a publicly held company controlled by the porsche and piech families

porsche has extensive business dealings with vwaudi which causes some confusion

since currently porsche is in some financial difficulty there is a possibility that mercedes or vw may be interested in purchasing the company in the near future but this is only speculation at this time

about selling it

ive said over and over that she should sell it before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may actually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability

 yes there are still alot of mgbs out there

the earlier cars pre  are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having chrome bumpers ride height generally more power

the older cars are appreciating slowly

the newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the moment

 to k would require extremely good condition and low miles

if the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it the car should last for a long time

there are still plenty of parts sources ouththere

the mgb is a great fun little car

if she is keeping it solely in the hopes that it is going to appreciate tell her to sell it

it is not worth waiting the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level

hhmcbnewsdcbattcom herschelhmayo writes well if you want to stick the nose of your car up the ass of a  foot semi i suppose its your neck however im not going to let you kill me in the bargain

if you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death due to less that wise driving practices then tough

well i never wrote that i would act as you described

i stated that i would not block a wouldbe passer

i would not block a wouldbe passer for their own good or for any reason other than i was prevented from doing so due to the traffic circumstance

i fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would in any way decrease your chances of being involved in an accident fatal or otherwise

in fact i could imagine how blocking a wouldbe passer would actually increase your chances of being offed or involved in an accident especially if this passer is riding your bumper

intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly not a wise driving practice it only causes the jam to become more congested

i dont mess with trucks and i actually watch the road ahead and the road behind

if i perceive that i am rapidly closing on a pack of vehicles i try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you decribe

usually either traffic is just building and i have to deal with this fact of life or i wait to a slow passer to complete their pass and make way for the pack to clear

if someone decides then to pull up on my bumper i signal my intention to move to the right and do so at the first opportunity  hope they will open the jam

i feel this is not only courteous driving but alot safer than the actions you advocate

there are actually many courteous drivers on the road who do not intentionally impede others

if someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic i use my blinker or flash my lights or if all else fails will briefly speed up slow down so they might get the message that i am a faster vehicle trying to pass

i feel it is never safe to ride anyones bumper

if someone is intentionally blocking traffic because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason i feel they deserve at the very least derision

backup lights on corvette  theyre on the sides of the car

   sure would be interested to know what years this was

i dont seem to recall any car with backup lights on the sides much less any corvette

i suppose i could be misinterpreting what you are trying to say here just a quick comment

backup lights mounted on the side would actually be extremely useful for people backing out of parking stalls

while i cant think of any corvettes with side mounted backup lights i know that saab started using them about  years ago

my  saab  didnt have them but a friends  saab  certainly did

in addition to the confentional taillight mounted backup lights they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly

for those of you who dont remember saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth about the size of a national geographic magazine sticking out of the front fender which incorporated amber parking lights amber side marker lightsreflectors white cornering lamps like american luxury cars aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on and white backup lights aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear

the glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards pot holes kids toys etc that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up

i have been using regular unleaded

a friend of mine has kya jetta and has always used super unleaded and thinks i should be using the same kyhowever i believe the advantages of super unleaded for cars  and under kyhas been overplayed by guess who the companies who sell them because that is kywhere they make the most profit

a ralph nader report and other consumer advocates kyhave in the past spoken against those oil companies

your passat vr is designed to run on premium gasoline however the engine electronics will retard the timing so that no harm wil be done to the engine with lower octane fuel

you will likely however get somewhat more power and fuel mileage especially in hot weather out of this particular engine if you do run it on premium

from jackwboihpcom jack wood subject bbb autoline arbitration organization hewlettpackard  boise idaho xnewsreader tin version  pl keywords bbb arbitration lemon lines  my bbb autoline arbitration experience is over

the outcome was decidedly mixed

i won the battle but lost the war

the arbitrator found that the car was defective but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value 

at the time of the hearing average retail on my truck in the nada book was  but the decision was for 

i wrote a letter to the council of better business bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you

there is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase

the attitude of chevrolets representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously

i decided to take the repurchase even though i am getting totally screwed on the price

i will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself and i have no case for a civil suit based on the idaho lemon law

i am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the idaho lemon law is

the law allows for a use deduction equal to the irs mileage allowance

as if chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance

summary of the case in may  i bought a new  ton hd chevrolet pickup

between may  and december  this vehicle required repair after repair

systems that required attention included the transmission heater fan paint suspension and motor

the main problem was the five speed manual transmission

they could not install a nondefective transmission in at least four attempts

so in summary it is possible to get a repurchase but you are going to get screwed on the price unless you paid too much in the first place or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly

i would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was maintained

i own a turbocharged one and i would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless i knew the owner and hisher drivingmaintenance habits

question is that the  tsi awd was mentioned in the april consumer reports to a car to avoid

i have been wondering about that myself

the  awd models and the s were identical except for the abs option

in particular the manual transmission yes

some owners had problems with the transaxles

using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases

the problem was not unique to the awds however

it was common to all models

the galant vr and gsx had the same transaxle but i didnt see those listed in cr

electrical system i dont know of any major complaints in this area except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating

and brakes were below par in both models

the first fwd models those built before may  were recalled for brake upgrades

some fwd and awd owners had problems with warped rotors

those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem

a friend of mine ownes a  tsi awd and he has had  brake jobs pads i can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day

it all depends on how you drive

it seems that most owners have been getting between k on a set of pads

one stuck valve first time i hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars other than timing belt failures

and some clutchtransmission problem something about stickinggrinding into second gear

this doesnt seem too bad if one beats on his car

if your friend beats on the car then his unit is not a representative sample of the cars reliability

my suggestion is instead of listening to the useless consumer reports talk to several owners the mailing list may be the best way to reach a few of them

i am willing to suffer reliabilityfor speed and looks

seems you have to pay big buck if you want all three

im selling a  dodge stealth rt and i was contacted by this company called the markham group based out of illinois

they said they have  buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldnt be talking to me

they talked to me for a good  minutes asking everything about my car and said they could sell it no problem

they guaranteed that if they didnt sell my car in  days i would get my money back  and since i charged it im protected by federal law which states that if im not satisfied i would get a refund which is true

they federal expressed all the paperwork to me which had a contract stating their policy about the  days and such

i called up the bbb in illinois and they do not have a file on them which is good news

so they definitely are a legitimate company but so far its been over week and i have gotten nothing

so how effective are these types of companies

anybody care to share their experiences

 i am currently in the car market and would like opinions on a vw passat glx

how does it compare to a toyota camry

i thought the car looked very solid stable and european

only disappointment so far is that that it doesnt offer an airbao my next question is why isnt vw offering automobiles with airbags

should i pay the extra three thousand for a bmw  is even though it is smaller and less powerful than than the passat

i think vw got caught out on the airbag thing

its only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature

vw assumed that automatic belts would satisfy govt

requirements for passive restraint but didnt guess that the merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag

vw is really hurting right now in the us market

check out the article in last weeks autoweek about the crisis at vw

golfs and jettas will be coming from the plant in mexico but they dont have the quality at that facility

as per normal vw practice the us launch of the jetta iii is delayed again and again until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent

i think that passats come from germany so there is not the same quality and availability issue

its a nice car with a nice engine

whether vw will be a player in the us market in two years time is a different question ill leave the passat  camry flamewar for someone else

dont worry about which way to turn the damn thing

take a good claw hammer and pry it straight out

now youll notice after all the oil pours out that there are no theads where there used to be

thats why heli coils were invented

yes buy a few of these gems and rethread the hole a little larger each time you change the oil

when the hole gets too big for any heli coil you can buy its time to trade in the car

why should a good driver be terrified at mph

the only thing i fear going at  are drivers who switch to the left lane without using either rearviewmirror or flashers

doing  to  aint a rush for me but its fun and i get where i want to go much faster

in defense of the drivers who are in the right lane

here in the states people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of mph

i dont think this is because they are stupid of course there are exceptions they are just programmed because of the mph limit

do you in the states when you look in the rearview always calculate future positions of cars based on a  speed differential

dont get me wrong i love to drive in the left lane fast but when i overtake cars who are on the right i slow down a tad bit

if i were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential i would be the stupid one

btw if no one else is around then go for it

keep up the good work guys

afterall the cops need to be occupied with someone so that lesser mortals like us can be left alone

hello netters

 im visiting the us im from sweden in august

i will probably rent a chevy beretta from alamo

ive been quoted  for a week  for additional days

this would include free driving distance but not local taxes baltimore

they also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but i doubt that  cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than whats included in the base price

but on the other hand he didnt rent it from alamo

 does anyone have some info on this

 is  a ripoff

no that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city

probability that ill be needing more insurance

unless you have an accident you wont need more

if you plan on paying for the car with a credit card check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars

also your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also

most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent and require you to initial in several spots if you dont want it

the credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell

i have never rented from alamo so i dont know if they follow this same practice

is the beretta a good rental car

yes

it is a compact door probably a bit dull performance and accelerationwise but very adequate

it will have an automatic transmission amfm stereo air conditioning and possibly power windows and door locks

its a step in the right direction

the ashtray does make a convenient changeholder so its not completely useless

i have found a kit advertised for lowering the front end of an early mustang

installation envolves moving the upper aarm and installation of a wedge shaped spacer between the aarm and ball joint

apparently shelby mustangs did a similair modification but left out the spacer

 i would be interested in feedback pro or con on such a modification

im no mustang head but dont the early ones have a simple strut suspension that is with no upper aarm

just a strut going down to a lower control arm single bushing not an aarm with a tensioncompression rod locating it in the forwardbackward direction

anyway simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs cutting the springs lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch

in each of these cases the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle

a spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut roughly the height of the reduction will restore the suspension geometry

imho the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go ken  ken r dye an optimist is a guy  lachman technology inc chicago that has never had    x much experience  dyelachmancom archy

forget the net just take off the tailgate on hiway trips since the nets arent designed to nor capable of restraining a load in the bed anyway

bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things area the part about spending  on repairs reminds me of an article i read in a magazine comparing the  year ownership costs of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that

the result which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period

that was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry

now if i remember correctly the camry costs about  or so more in initial costs

essentially it means that you spend about  extra on repairs on the taurus

that is ridiculous

every time your car needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things

i would much rather spend  more in initial costs than spend  more in repair costs

however when she took it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about  dollars

the dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour

at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price

so is there any svx owner out there that has the same problem

from weltycabotballtowncmacom richard welty subject recautos automotive mailing lists how to set up your own keywords monthly posting replyto weltyballtowncmacom organization new york state institute for sebastian cabot studies lines  archivename recautospart new article as of  february   rpw many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics rather fewer know how to do it

this article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard unix systems

a shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a sparc  here at balltowncmacom for a number of mailing lists

note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list please let me know of the request address so that i can list it in the montly recautos posting

also inform the keeper of the usenet listoflists check newsanswers for this monthly posting

first of all to get anywhere you need to either  be a sysadmin or  have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin

it is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else or that you have trouble getting email through then your network connectivity is probably not good enough

listserv there is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv which is available from several ftp servers on the network

details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably look at listserv carefully

the alias file on a typical unix system there is a file named usrlibaliases on whichever file server is your mail host it contains lines such as foo bar baz bletch which means that any email sent the name foo on that host is redistributed to users bar baz and bletch

thus the simplest possible email list is myfavoritecar member member member myaddress myfavoritecarrequest myaddress this has a couple of problems the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file

however you can do the following with the connivance of your sysadmin myfavoritecar includehomemydirmiscautosmyfavoritecarlist myfavoritecarrequest myaddress where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses

this file can be in the list admins home directory owned by the list admin

bounced mail this still has a problem bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list which is generally considered somewhat irritating

therefore the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup by the way

im not sure where he got it from

schoolrequest welty schoolrebroadcast includehomenewweltymiscautosschoollist school usrlocaladmbinexplscript school ownerschool schoolrequest ownerschoolout schoolrequest heres what is going on here the owner and request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network

the request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties

school is what people send mail to instead of pointing at addresses it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email

schoolbroadcast of which nobody except me knows the name the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity points at the actual list members

the shell script i use is as follows  binsh cd tmp sed e replytod e senderd e from d   echo replyto balltowncmacom  echo errorsto requestballtowncmacom  echo sender requestballtowncmacom  cat    usrlibsendmail om f requestballtowncmacom  f the  mailing list rebroadcast exit   note that this script does not know the name of the list the name is passed in from outside so that the script may be used for multiple lists i run several out of this site

the script excises replyto sender and from lines from the incoming message substitutes for sender and replyto and adds errorsto  of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the request or owner addresses if this header rewrite is done

for digested lists there is some digestification software around

hopefully ill be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting

 i dont know about trains but ive saw a sign on the back of a greyhound bus that warns you that your radar detector may be set off

it doesnt explain why but it does set off my radar detector

because greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their radar collisionprevention system

they use radar to monitor how close other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are and signals a warning to the driver if theyre coming up on something too fast or are getting too close

this is all i remember from the news reports a few months back at the time they were only talking about the possibility of installing the system

they didnt mention how it worked in bumpertobumper traffic or how it discriminated between a camaro approaching at mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached at mph on a curve

i do recall something about progressive stages of warnings from flashing lights to audible warningsie it goes from a red too close light to hysterically screaming were all going to die

so its an automatic

dont know if us speccdn spec

for maximas

the car has  km or about  miles on it

a typical mileage for  cars seem to be about  km or about k mi

the seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards

he said he will replace the components before selling the car to me

 being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars i dont know what this could mean is k km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items

or is this an indication that the car was abused

if it is the first set of brake pads on front then this is fine

my car eats a set every k miles or so

the fact that he is replacing the muffler too is also ok would other things break down or have to be replaced soon

the mileage is fairly low  but typical fwd stuff is cv joints

check the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve adjustments timing belt changes and so on

the k mile service is often expensive so make sure he has done everything

the seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot but i dont know how to verify this ive seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood though

 well this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a car with highway miles

might check the gas pedal wear too

ask him how many sets of tires he has been through

a highway car might have squeezed by on  sets a hard driven car  sets

although the maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept its currently out of warranty a similarly priced  accord with k km will have  years or k km worth of warranty left and i dont want to worry about paying for any repair bills well the maxima should be pretty reliable  but if its out of warranty you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first

stuff for japanese cars can be expensive

but i also need a car for  people  when will the new maxima come out by the way

model year i believe

the brakes on the sho are very different   inch or 

i forget discs all around vented in front

the normal taurus setup is smaller discs front drums rear

 one i saw had vented rears tooit was on a lot

of course the sales man was a fooltitanium wheelsyeah right then later told me they were magnesiummore believable but still crap since al is so m uch cheaper and just as good  i tend to agree tho that this still doesnt take the sho up to standard for running  on a regular basis

the brakes should be bigger like  or sotake a look at the ones on the corradoswhere they have braking regulations

 well lets seemy tbird sc has a computercontrolled adjustable suspension wheel abs disks  vented front  

rear point  rears also vented belts sturdy passenger compartment aerodynamics good enough for nascar without too much change  hp ftlb supercharged l v wheel independent suspension plus limitedslip differential with a top speed in excess of mph and rides on vrated tires i have yet to find rs in any other speed rating

 is that up to standard

if not why not

 james i really hate to do this but try reading the damn posts

then you shouldntve done it

try answering the damn question

i am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the sc in there

never was a tbird mentioned

the discussion was about shos and stangs not being up to spec

i do not know about tbirds

i only know that the specs quoted for the sho by previous poster sounded a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff

this does not kn any way disencourage me from wishing to own one nor does it make it a bad car

it merely means that i think ford could have added that extra bit of safety and tossed in larger brakes as the wheels are plenty large enough for them to fit if memory serves right which it may very well not and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it

well my point was that the sc and the sho both have very similar characteristics front and rear disks abs on the sho high output v wheel independent suspension very good aerodynamics point harness fat rubber and mph top speed

if one of them is up to standard and i think the sc is but the other isnt then why is that

a replica would be great i think

greetings you may be in luck

i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a mould sp

off a real kubel and has adapted it to the beetle floorpan

as for the suspension all i can remember about the vw thing i used to own is that it had about  more suspension travel than a stock beetle but id heard that there were after market parts for offroad use that were as good or better

note that the major difference looks wise between a kubel  a thing are the hood and the fenders

the kubel had an external spare mounted on the hood and the hood sloped down for visibility

sharply and had rounded fenders

the thing has a lightly sloped hood with the spare mounted inside unless moved to make for more luggage space and has halfhexagon shaped fenders imagine a nut large enough to put a tire in and cut off the bottom half of it unfortunately i dont have that info anymore

try stopping at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the two big mags and calling them

yes i saw a  turbo quattro wagon on i in nj on monday

i thought audi stopped selling wagons in the us after the 

this is exactly the type of vehicle i would like to own

i bet its price is  times my car budget

think again

thanks to  minutes tick tick tick used  quattros are bargains s go for about k s go for perhaps  or k more the  valve s are quite a bit more because of an enormous hp and torque gain i think they go for about  to k if you can find one

i have seen quite a lot of   quattros not that many wagons though at the dealer lot they use very high quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized so it will never rust

in short typically a  yr old  looks no more older than a  year old and the  bangers are bullet proof engines

k out of one is not rare even for a turbo which is watercooled for the s then there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost if you are into luxogizmos the cars are loaded with just about everything too the price of parts is a different story though eliot

 sounds a lot more like an opel gt to me

id guess that this is on the same chassis as the kadett rather than the bigger manta  but i could easily be wrong

i think the later kadetts were sold here as buick opels

 craig   i think the manta is the european name for the gt

im pretty sure well the european manta and us gt have entirely different bodies

there is little or no chance that they are the same

the manta went through several generations as the coupe version of the ascona and was ok in its time

that the only kadetts sold here wereare the pontiac lemans

i think the not true

the kadett has been in and out of the us market over the years

the lemans old kadett is only the latest version

craig gt is just an early s to mid s manta

i fail to see why people feel the need to expound upon this issue for days and days on end

these areas are not  meant for this type of discussion

if you feel the need to do such things  please take your thought elsewhere

thanks

 i just want to second this request

i value this net group as one where people focus on solving problems and go out of their way to be respectful of differences

the hostility expressed in the original posting feels like an assault

 thanks jan    exactly my point

there is a lot of hostility to and from teenagers

  look i sent these posts here to altparentsteens with a copy to  recautos since you people in this group may have the best advice for  and experience with troubled teenagers

  if you follow the news for the northwest usa you will have heard that a  group of year old boys barely out of the teens certainly their outlook  was developed during their teens just shot and killed an innocent little  girl riding in a car in the seattle area when her mother who was driving  honked her horn at the car with the boys in it

this is really upsetting  and makes my stomach turn as it would any parents

doesnt your heart  just go out to that poor mother

 yes fred my heart and prayers go out to the mother and others who have been victims of these and other senseless crimes

 you folks in this group have a responsibility to offer any good advice  that you may have

i suspect lots of people all over the world will read  and appreciate your comments

 however i feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings see top

your statement of responsibility is felt as an attack towards the members of this group

you are attempting to make the members of this group be required to answer

the only people who should make a statement are people who have experienced the problem and found a workable solution

 teenagers both drive cars and are involved in automotive vandalism and  crime

maybe someone on this newsgroup has had specific experience in  dealing with violent teenage offenders like these kids are

at the same  time maybe you would have some good advice for those hostile people who  sense that are now the potential victims

maybe you would have some good  advice for them on how not to pay back andor not make the situation worse

 maybe you have some good advice for local authorities or schools where  this problem is prevalent

but then again maybe youre not interested

 many people are interested but have no input

i will restate that your last sentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group

if people have input they will give it

if they do not you should not make them feel compelled sp

to respond

if you wish to continue this conversation please send email

do not repost or attempt to bait me i will not make another post and may i make the same a suggestion to other group members on this matter

roads like the autobahn are smoother straiter wider and slightly banked

example a few months back i was traveling late at night   am or so and i was changing highways at a bent crosssing

it curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about  ft and continued to the left strait north

i wanted to turn north checked the south lane rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane

nevertheless there wasnt a car in sight so i took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane

now my car isnt a  sec  performer but i was in the corect lane and over  in decent time even at  i wasnt wasting time

it was then that i checked my mirror and saw a mustang closing in my lane fast he had just turned the corner and was just noticing me

luckly he saw me and changed lanes in time i estamate he was moving in excess of  or so

i was just a by stander i had no chance of runing from him or moving out of his way

im glad he saw my brake lights in time

i shudder to think of what would have happened had i wainted to pull out and not left the time he needed to dodge me

most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators and ive never seen nor heard of a vandal opening one

i imagine that there would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have to crawl furthur under the car to open it

in article pvjlninnckfdaffyspsmotcom shantanuriscspsmotcom shantanu ganguly writes   some comments   a good performance and mid and high speeds can be obtained by adjusting the  top gear and final drive ratios

contrary to popular misperception a  number of japanese cars have quite good performance from  in top  gear

 no problem with that

the question is do they perform consistently in all conditions roads winds and curves at that speed and do so for hours on end year after year without giving the driver white knuckles

from my experience on the autobahnsautostrade a good touring car can be easily distinguished by its poise at mph

the best stay on cruise control at  for hours

ive seen the typical boy racer in a fiat try to keep up

sure they hit the century mark but if the wind blows the wrong way they change lanes and if on an overpass they may fly right into a guardrail

the buffeting at  can be severe enough to make the hood bend

tires at  can melt and a pothole can kill

many german cars are designed for this environment even if they cant seem to get out of their own way from a stop light mercedes come to mind in particular

and another design point is fuel economy at those speeds

the germans gear the car for very good high speed efficiency a typical mb e turns  at  almost a stall  good point

i have no idea how either of my hondas will handle at  mph nor do they reach 

however using high to be  mph a they are quite amenable to long high speed drives

ive done several k mile trips in my civic with no problems whatsoever

the last big trip i made was driving from new york to texas

i remember driving  miles a day at typically  mph without any problems

im sure i would have been more comfortable driving a benz but no white knuckles

no problems with winds and curves

then there was the trip back from new orleans after mardi gras  where we were doing  all the way to houston

no problems

b both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds

i see no difference between sustained  mph and sustained mph

on the trip back from new orleans we got about  mpg in my integra quite ok

mind you the engine revs to almost k at 

the civic is markedly better than the integra in fuel economy

k miles down the road i still get  mpg at  mph driving

 b i cant understand why these highscale european marquees are afraid  to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in  the low gears

i have been doing that for that last k miles with  my lowly civic with no detriment to either the engine or the clutch  and getting excellent mpg to boot

id call this an engineering hack  to cover up design deficiencies

 at k miles youd still be breakingin a highscale european marquee they typically are designed to last  miles per engine  mi

per chassis

the record is now over  miles on a benz diesel and ive read about transmissions lasting  miles

speaking of now now you cant compare a diesel with a gasoline engine

i see enough bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have k miles on them and advertise rebuilt engines

if honda was to build an accord for k id darn well expect the sucker to last k miles

diesels they have very good efficiency at the cost of acceleration and are very popular in all european cars diesel is considered the green fuel from the smallest econoboxes to the luxobarges

again we see a difference in mentality

diesels in the us are considered slightly worse than useless and extremely dirty to boot so you cant give them away

ever got caught behind a early s sdl at a stop light

its not pleasant

the newer mbs are a lot better though

the diesel volvos and vws are probably the smelliest offenders

as for economy why should we care

gas is cheap

from jchenwindbellcorecom jason chen subject militech nntppostinghost windbellcorecom replyto jchencttbellcorecom organization bell communications research lines  i saw an interesting product in ny auto show and would like to hear your comments

militechtm is yet another oil additive

but the demonstration of this product really impressive if it didnt cheat

the setup of the demo is fairly simple

a cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink filled with motor oil

the rotor is powered by an electronic motor

a metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction

the torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench

before militech was added the rotor was stopped with about  lbft of torque you pick the brand of oil no difference

once militech was added to the oil the rotor could not be stopped even with  lbft of torque

here is the good part even after the salesman emptied the oil sink you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained on it

they say you need only add oz per quart of oil every k miles

a  oz bottle is 

i still have my doubts

if this product is really so great why it was so little known

the salesman said it is widely used in military

i didnt believe it

the demo was so impressive that i bought a bottle against my common sense

has anyone heard of or actually used this product

is it real

if you are going to the auto show please visit this stand on the second floor

see if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not

in article aprmichaelapplecom emsmichaelapplecom e michael smith writes does it take any peculiar tools to remove the rear springs from a ford f truck

this is a x with leaf springs front and rear

 so with a big socket and an air wrench and a floor jack and a hydrolic bottle jack  can i do this at home

i found that i needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks

and a can of wd helped

the sockets needed were metric exact fit but i was able to use some sae sockets  and  are rather close to  and mm

it can be fun having a canadian ford  im pictureing this undo u bolts

put a bottle jack on the axle and raise the bedframe to take stress off of the leaf spring

undo the end boltsbushings

drop the spring

turn the bottom leaf

reconnect the spring bolts  sounds about right

didnt have to undo the end boltsbushings

just the  u bolts on each side and the shock absorber

jacking up the frame some more had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden platform on top of that to get the floor jack high enough to raise the frame 

it one talll truck lifted the spring free of the axel

taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together

the spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other end no wrench head vice grips worked fine

i soaked the nut with wd and it came right off

flipped the bottom spring and then is this a nightmare waiting to happen or an easy though physically demanding thing to do

 well its easier than doing a decent trigger job on a a  ok well maybe its not that easy but its not terribly difficult

i donno  im a little more sore today than after working on a a  a 

foot pipe cheater was a real help

torque spec for the u bolt nuts is  to  ftlbs 

a a doesnt have that kind of torque spec 

it was a challenge to get the pack bolt back in the spring pack

squeeze pack with two hands hold bolt with third put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands 

i used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment then i could let go to get the nut wrench vice grips

getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too until i discovered that the axel had  tilted andor  rolled forward

one the drivers side a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole

on the passenger side i had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about  inch to get things to line up

spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before i took a break and thought about why it wasnt lined up anymore since it had been lined up before and i didnt move it something else must have  hmmm axle no longer constrained not to move  hmmm move it back hmmm after that it was all much easier to close up

water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friends  ford probe

every once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk

i would guess this usually happens after a good thunder storm

a few qs  is this a common problem

yes this is a common problem

the leaks occur through the seal of the taillights

unfortunately ford has this with most probes and does not have a recall for it

very dissatisfying to say the least

 where are the drain holes located for the hatch

there is no drain holes that i know of

i used a margine tub to drain it regretably i waited three months as i was short cash and they wouldnt fix it under warrantee

then i paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system including a balancemotion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in the trunk

this resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioningthey would not retract

so i ended up paying about  to have the sensor replaced  to have the tail lights resealed they firts replaced the hatch gasket which i insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that when i proved to be right

 not to mention the water damage to the covers to the trunkspare com partment and algae in the taillights

very annoying

dont let the water problem goget it fixed or youll pay more later

considering how common a problem it is i hope every one complains to ford

unless the law has been changed recently carrying a weapon openly is legal in colorado but concealing it is illegal

i read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a traffic infraction and observed a 

magnum revolver sitting on the seat

the driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon because it was not concealed

the article stated that if the gun had been discovered in the glove box it would have been considered a crime

i bought one for my wife

 nnnnnnnng thank you for playing i cannot agree with this

i believed this and to put it nicely it was a piece of junk

i loved this car i babied it i pampered it and after  years it just couldnt stay together i would say that not everyone will have the problems that i had but know this its not just the car it is the ability to get the car fixed which will not happen at any chryslerdodgetake your pick dealer

i dont care if there are going to reform their dealersservice with the intro of the lh cars i will believe it when i see it

case and point the local dodge dealer

you drive up just looking you dont even get out of your door when about  yes  salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards

service is about  times worse than that

i had an alignment problem but they tried to tell me that the k frame was bent and about  dollars of workparts to fix it

let me tell you the problems i had and i took care of this car i put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldnt have been

dodge shadow es these were replaced within the  years that i owned the car

engine  alternators rear suspension torsion bar  water pumps  thermostats hall effect sensor main computer  batteries these were rebuiltrepaired radiator automatic transmission power steering those are just the things i can remember off the top of my head

for about a year before i sold the car i said to myself its a good car i just cant find anybody competent enough the fix it

in the end before i traded it in for a saturn the power steering started acting up again

i just stopped putting money into it

i must have put at least  worth of repairs over its lifetime

i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me

bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope

you can do better and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product saturn

i will not touch another chrysler product again no way

i dont care how good the lh cars look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get

gm isnt much better thank god they dont control saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy

dont get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like a hawk for the next  years

i am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to me

but since someone else pointed out cd as a source

i will note because i used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated kcar and engine

whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars

no car magazine is really objective

and although there are alot of people who dont like consumers reports i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadowsundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chryslers rate a better than average i think the best one is just average

excluding the diamond starmitsubishi stuff and the lhs

you can find bad stuff about the shadow

try as i might when i researched the saturn i could not find anything bad about it

there is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason

much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company

i read an article which had a subcolumn an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else

some big wig in toyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely

come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created

they are still struggling because they havent learned yet

they have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is and they are just finding this out

the military surplus stuff ive driven  jeep classic willyskaiseramc preindependent suspension and power wagons slant  in a crewcab pickup werent exactly congenial at highway speeds and i wouldnt swear any of them would do  except as a bedload on a semi

you just gotta love the standard military tire too or at least the one they used to use

designed circa ww ii as a compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity on sharp rocks and so forth its quite illadapted to high speeds on civilian roadways

for those who cant remember what they look like imagine a mountainbike tire with a road rib in the middle scaled up to car size

oh yeah and narrow too

one of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of the advancements made in ride and handling since dday

but the point made by wharfie and others still stands if youre going to do  in a milspec  power wagon or a jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubbertired vehicle anywhere id suggest the american interstate

compare either to the porsche  and you tell me which was designed to go fast

you have a point about the brakes especially seeing as how the mustang doesnt even have disc brakes in the back

but there are significant differences between the latest s and the late s s not the least of which is handling

im not  i think you mean late s the biggest change that porsche undertook to alter the tailhappieness of their baby was way back in august  for the  model year when they stretched the wheelbase

besides some people actually know how to take advantage of oversteer and enjoy it

in europe

 are there any mr owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why my mrs engine sounds noisy

the mrs engine is noisy at the best of times but not even a nice nose  its one of those very ugly noises

assuming yours is a non turbo mr the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline  that doesnt have balance shafts

i guess toyota didnt care about little details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling

myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or recommendation which has an inline  larger than  liters and no balance shafts it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine

if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a v eliot

hi there ive recently been toying with the idea of purchasing an old 

the going rate seems to be about  for cars with anywhere from k mi

my question is this what should i expect at this price

should i expect to have extensive body work done

what about engine  transmission should i likewise expect to have both virtually replaced

along those lines does anyone have the names  addresses of any mailorder parts suppliers for everything from engine to body parts

im completely new to the area of restoring cars and as i dont actually do any work with cars most of the work would have to be professionally done what sould i expect the cost of upgrading a  to a rustfree mechanically sound automobile

thanks in advance andre   true  enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this but ill dump my impressions

ive wanted to own a  for about  years now came close once but i ended up buying a fiero instead biggest mistake of my life

anyway for  you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit

the most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment

also look for chassis welded together here

oh yeah the price range you are talking about must be the  banger a  if you could find one would be mucho more bucks

parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by for an old car and you can even locate crude in the jc whitney catalog if you have too

the machine itself is pretty simple they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake

so getting it fixed by a good bugporsche mechanic would be easy

since it is midengine you may spend more on labor for any mechanical work

however if a professional thief wants your vehicle its as good as gone no matter what you do

but to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options

that would be  ignition kill or fuel cutoff  a flashing red led these two are basic to a decent alarm system

to slow down the criminal some more get a steering wheel lock

that should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target

but then theres always carjacking

why is life so confusing

i hope i helped somewhat

autos are fine for sedate little sedans but they have no business in performance cars imho

  james  i have to disagree with this

i have a  z with a  and a speed auto w overdrive and it is really better that way

chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power

i live in the dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic here

now if i still lived out in the sticks like i used to a manual would be more fun

 i dont know if its as much an issue of their ablility to handle the power as it is the power they lose in the torque converter etc

safetywise an auto is less distractingi would hate to have to be shifting gears while i was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here

performancewise i can hold my own against any stock

     as long as were on the subject several years ago myself and two others  were riding in the front of a toyota pickup heading south on interstate   north of seattle wa

someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our  windshield

not by accident im sure it was impossible to get up to the  overpass quickly to see who did it

we figured it was kids reported it and  left

 a couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company

he was  in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children

turned out there was  a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away

they caught the  year old  that did it

they put a cover over the overpass what else could they do

 i dont think ill over forget this story

in des moines iowa about a year ago some kid dropped a rock from an overpass and hit car just behind the windshield

it put a dent in the roof so i guess i was lucky it hit metal

its frustrating that we cant do much

bother the city government to put covers on all overpasses

slow downspeed up a bit when driving under all overpasses in the city

i like the first better but that will take time and lots of people talking to the city governments

i am sorry to report that in southern california it was a sick sport for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the freeway

several persons were killed when said blocks came through their windshields

many overpass bridges are now fenced and they have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges as if that would stop such people

yet many bridges are not fenced

i always look up at a bridge while i still have time to take evasive action even though this sport has not reached us here in fresno

of course i am trying to make plans of how to spend all this extra  money

right now i have an  accord a good car but not real sporty   i was thinking of selling it in about two years and dropping around  k on a sports car of some kind

after thinking about it i may have a  better idea  ill keep the accord until it drops and buy the car ive  always wanted  a corvette stingray

my reasoning is that  accord   corvette  is less than what i would spend anyway

   basically im thinking of a late s early s for around k

 my question is what are good years to consider for reliability looks  horsepower  in that order believe it or not horsepower is not a main  concern if i want to go fast i get on my motorcycle and what are  good prices

   also what would insurance look like

im male single  i might  wait until im  to get the car  lower insurance

would the fact that  i mainly drive the other car lower it

is there some type of classic  car or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under k miles  per year

   my dad has a  vette and its on what you say classic insurance

 basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving  time which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would  probably suit your needs for limited mileage

  in addition to restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also require that the vehicle be garaged when not in use

  i was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage

what kind of memory is stablereliable enough nonvolatile enough and independent enough of outside battery power to last say  years or more in the life of a vehicle

im amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time especially in light of all the gizmos i work with that are doing good to work for  months without breaking down somehow

 mkt from thomsom

it has a timekeeper clock and  bytes of nvram which has a lithium battery backup

the battery has a life of  years of poweroff operation

installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not draw much current

the battery would only be used when your auto battery was dead or had been removed

side question how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at  miles after say k actual miles

looks like fraud would be fairly easy  for the price of a new odometer you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has

in california they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states that the odometer mileage is correct

if incorrect you are required to fill in what you know or guesstimate to be the correct mileage

if you lie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can sue you for the value of the mileage differential

in article wfnmbjgwboelcandrewcmuedu srinagesh gavirneni sgandrewcmuedu writes i have a  chevy sprint with ac and doors

its odometer turned k and the sensor light started blinking

i went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying i need to change the oxygen sensor

he said it is to be changed every k but since i bought the car when it had k i dont know if the same thing happened at k and k he quoted  for the part and  to install it

the part cost  outside but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts

he suggested i wait till it malfunctions before i do anything

if anyone out there owns a chevy sprint i want to know how they got their oxygen sensors changed

also did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealers help

also what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction

 any help would be greatly apprecisted  thanks  nagesh i have owned my sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every k to let you know its time for a check up

when that light goes on i just take it to the delaer tell them its that time and they work on it for  hou and you pay  for parts and  for labor

ahhwhat they get for labor i currently have about k on my sprint and of all the times i took it in for service i never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the oxygen sensor

what the heck is an oxygen sensor

as far an i know of i have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten

now i dont have ac mother nature does that for me   and that might have something to do with it but i still never heard of an oxygen sensor

the only major service job i have had on my car besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job was getting the rotor distributor and gasket replaced

and that was all done within the past  months

what i do at k is have a good tuneup let them replace what ever they need to pay the bill about  and go home and dont worry about the car for another k oh i just remembered something

if that little sensor light bothers you in the fuse box right below the turnsignal lever up against the dash there is a swith on the right side

flip that switch and the light will go off

i do that so that little light wont annoy me

if you cant find it look it up in the car manuel

i hope that i have helped a little and good luck with the oxygen sensor

oh come on silly all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole

  experience with jeep service dept   while not exactly a service incident i had a similar experience recently when i bought a new truck

i had picked out the vehicle i wanted and after a little haggling we agreed on a price

i wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them id be back that evening to pick up the truck

when i returned i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could get to me

when i finally got in there everything went smoothly until he started adding up the numbers

he then discovered that they had miscalculated the tax  license by about 

he then said he needed another  from me

i said we had already agreed on a price and it was their problem i wasnt giving them any more money

the finance guy then brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time

i reminded him that i was the customer and i didnt think i should be treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole deal

he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it snatched back my check and left

needless to say they were not pleased by the turn of events

early the next morning i got a call from the general sales manager wanting to know what happened

i related the story and he apologised profusely and asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind

i told him that if they gave me the truck for free i probably still wouldnt take it that there were other dealers in town i was a repeat customer of theirs and that they should learn how to treat customersetcetci was still pretty steamed about the whole affair

he gave me the line about hating to lose a customer and they would try to find a solution etc etc

i told him not to bother thanks id go somewhere else

a couple hours later the owner of the dealership called me all apologetic etc etc etc and said that they would cover the  plus knock another  off the price of the truck

i told him id think about it and he gave me his private direct phone number his secretarys name and assured me that they valued me as a customer etc etc etc

i thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we decided what the hellthat was a pretty decent deal so i called him back and accepted his offer

when i went back the next day to pick up the truck i received the royal treatment

everyone seemed to know about the incident even the lot boy

everything went smoothly and i was out of there in my new truck in about  mins

so i guess im a reasonably satisfied customer

however it should not have happened in the first place

i was a bit shocked to have a sales person talk to me like that

i dont expect them to bow and grovel but i sure dont expect to be given a hard time either esp

when its their mistake

anyway im happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first years license fee

im not sure whether ill go back to that dealer tho

i  can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but   pound rocks

has our society really stooped this low

the basic reason  is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is  no big deal

kids see hundreds on murderous acts on tv we can abort  children on demand and kill the sick and old at will

so why be surprised  when some kids drop  lbs rocks and kill people

they dont care because the  message they hear is life is cheap

  yes but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot

  all they have to do is reach underneath turn a valve and forget the trip  home

 but there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them

  i personally recommend installing a special locking drain plug to keep  vandals away

   steve i was worried about someone stealing my oil once also

i finally decided to just have my drain plug welded shut

it works great 

i figure that when i add three or four quarts when the oil light comes on every month or so that its just as good or better than the old wives tale of changing the oil and filter every  miles

works for me i must say

there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up

my autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but i believe the following to be true my knowledge about driving in the us is also secondhand but i think i can correct your statements about our autobahn 

drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here

oh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it

from all ive heard from my us relatives drivers esp

here in germany are much more agg ressive but not disciplined

one of my relatives a la resident hired a car at the nuernberg airport and went about  miles to our home

he said then that he grew about  year older during this ride and swore hed never drive a car in germany again this was in  and he kept his promise  the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic

what you mean by better disciplined should perhaps be considered cautious due to fear when driving around here you always have to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you they expect that nobody fails or sleeps many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go of course only where that is allowed you might think  dream on 

so any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health  and if youre ex posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver you learn to handle it  or you lose thats the way i and most people i know experience our traffic situation  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you i think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest compared to the volume and decreasing rates of lethal accidents  otoh more and more people esp

women dislike driving because they feel overtaxed and threatened and each accident is one accident too much



the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than  they are here and usually include animal fences

this makes them  far more predictable than most us highways

better designed and maintained may be  but animal fences are very rare

auto bahnen and many other streets have guardrails i hope thats the right word  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights its about  feet high those guardrails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road

smaller animals can crawl under the plank bigger ones can easily jump over it

the point is that esp

larger animals are very rare in germany they tend also to be very timid

accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger



not all of europe is the autobahn

most places in europe have  speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in  the us  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not  much higher than kmh

youre right there are speed linits even on the major part of the autobahn  but the attitude towards driving see above seems to be very similar to that in germany ive been in france switzerland italy austria spain belgium the netherlands  besides that you really cant rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits

ive got quite a lot of practise k miles and im used to travel at  mph fyi with a car even smaller than a rabbit but i consider driving on the highways round paris or milano really a thrill i strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing mph nearly kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong



sorry but youll find quite a lot rabbitclasscar or even smaller mine is a peugeot  owners going that fast small cars with much hp are very hip over here  and most people buying such cars arent afraid to let them run

 

some people have no respect for their own lives

i disagree the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant

formula cars weigh less than  kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at  mph or higher  otoh when crashing against a solid object at  mph it makes no difference whether you sit in a porsche a mercedes a tank or on a bicycle yourre dead

of math  comp

sci

lines  is clear coat really worth it

yes on the showroom floor the cars have this deep lustrous shine that just cant be found on paint jobs that arent clear coated

on the other hand it seems that every clear coated car that ive seen on the road in a parking lot etc

has fine scratches throughout the paint job

as does alas my  laser

several weeks ago i had my car professionally polished and waxed

when i picked it up it had that same showroom shine that i remember from a year ago when i bought it

several days ago i took my car to the dealership for some work

as an added bonus they washed my car

unfortunately whoever washed it either didnt get the roof which is black the rest of the car is red completely clean before he dried it or he used a dirty towel

now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that arent really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle

i am to put it mildy somewhat peeved about this

do i have any chance of getting the dealership to do something about this

my guess is no

is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem

or am i faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches

information commiseration and sympathy all greatly appreciated

in article aprslcsslbcom dcdsehoustongeoquestslbcom dan day writes in article apracsucalgaryca parracsucalgaryca charles parr writes as a long time motorcyclist i have never understood what posessed auto builders to put delicate controls which must be used with skill and finesse like clutches and brakes on the floor

 why not hand control

its much much easier

 in the early days neither of these functions had powerassist so only legs had enough strength to activate them

since then its been traditional and people would have a hard time getting used to anything else

well where exactly would you put a hand clutch and brake

on a motorcycle its easy the handlebars have a very limited range of turning

steering wheels on the other hand turn around and around and aroundwhich is fine for electrical relays like your cruise control and airbagbut how many of you want to lose your clutch andor brake due to a short circuit

shades of the edsel

they had pushbuttons in the steering wheel hub that controlled the auto tranny

it was very disconcerting to shift into reverse when turning a corner and the wires shorted

there are workarounds but theres really no reason to use hand power on a cars clutch or brakes and lightening them to the point that they are finesse controls suitable for hand use would increse the mechanical complexity substantially look at power brakes and nonpower brakes for an example

i saw an experimental car that had a joystick instead of a steering wheel thats about useless imho

another automotive oddity is separate keys for trunks doors and ignitions

why on earth would you want this

 i know i dont

i want a separate trunk key for security reasons it gives me a totally separate lockable container

for door and ignitionehhh the same keys ok i guess

bmw cars are bimmers

  actually some purists would argue that the only true bimmer is a round  tail light  or 

  mark back when i was building round tail light s they were bimmers

apparently youre not a woman  my husband hates the auto door locks features but forgets that besides families with children a woman feels safer in a car that locks easily in addition to watching around  checking out if anyones near me when i get to my car  never park in a secluded spot etc  have my keys ready to open the door so im not fumbling in my purse looking for them 

this has me thinking

is there a biological reason why women cant put their keys in their pants pockets like men do

i have two pockets on the back of each of my pants

i put my keys in one and wallent in another

many of the pockets even have a botton on them so i can close them securely

everything is that much simpler for me

why cant women do the same

is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents

from ljbartelnaomibbingrcom les bartel subject fast idle on  ford ranger replyto ljbartelnaomibbingrcom organization intergraph corporation lines  it did it again

this morning my  ford ranger was idling at  rpm

ok so i exaggerated a little but it was idling very fast

it has a  liter carburated engine in it and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal i dont think the linkage is stuck

what can i do to fix this problem

this has been a problem from time to time but has straightened itself out  until now

i dont have a tach but by gauging by the sound of the engine it is idling about twice as fast as it should be

this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up at a stop light

 i came upon a  train parked on a trestle with its locomotive sitting directly over  the northbound lanes

 just as i passed from underneath the trestle  my radar detector went into full alert  all lights lit and all chirps  beeps and buzzes going strong

 could this have been caused by the trains radio or what

recentlymanufactured locomotives have wheelslip detection systems that use frequencies shared with police radar i forget which band

these will set off your radar detector if you get close enough though i believe the range is pretty short

btw railroad police sometimes use radar to check for speeding trains just like regular police check for speeding cars although the intent here is for safety not revenue collection unlike with cars

 i have news for you  capitalism is the practice of maximizing profits

 same difference if you lower your costs you increase your profits

 personally im not at all bothered by the saturn pricing scheme

if i dont want to pay as much as theyre selling it for i can go buy a different car from a different dealer and they get nothing

thats competition for you

if the dealer can be competitive charging what they do and making that kind of profit thats capitalism at its best and more power to em

  id rather have the consumer dictate what things will cost not the dealers

sorry but neither dictates the cost

its a negotiation

whether its up front at a honda dealership in an all out dickering war or more removed on a larger economic scale ie if saturn cant sell at its price the price drops or the company stops building them it remains a negotiated value controlled by market forces

to think that the consumer controls price is ludicrous

if the consumer controled price then cars would be freeand no one would build cars

make you wonder

this isnt anything new

back in  i was driving under a high overpass at night on i in san diego when i caught a glimpse of someone on the overpass

as i passed under a rock slammed against the metal between the winshield and right front window

my girlfriend was in the seat next to it

i called the police from the next exit but i doubt if they were found

about five years ago in san diego someone was put into a coma from a brick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and subsequently crashed

i dont think he ever came out of the coma and i havent heard anything about it for a couple years

i know that this isnt the group for it but since you brought it up does anyone have any idea why they havent bombed the waco cult

probably because there are many children there

also the minor fact that other than defending themselves from  some people attacking them they havent threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in years

being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds for a mass murder of koresh and his followers

sorry for posting this to this group but i thought the previous post needed a rebuttal

if you followup to this portion please crosspost and direct followups to a more appropriate newsgroup

my opinions certainly dont match those of my employer

the quality of autobahns is something of a myth

the road surface isnt much different to a typical tx freeway

they are better in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc

they light the highways in texas

funny everywhere else ive been they only light em at junctions

i wont even get into how much road markings vary between states and localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are essentially nonexistant

than most of the roads here

a dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at  will kill you at 

dont get me wrong i love to it would have to be quite severe

i dont recall any us freeway without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe at  in any decent well damped car

i suspect you have very limited experience  us freeways vary dramatically particularly between states

i can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where  would be very optimistic in any car

im not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations but i suspect every single bridge junction on i through ct would be considered so

theyre hard to take at mph

thats not the only interstate ive seen with such deviations but its one i drive frequently

texas is pretty much an edgecase  you cant assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such wideopen spaces

it just aint so

  exactly my point

there is a lot of hostility to and from teenagers

  if you follow the news for the northwest usa you will have heard that a  group of year old boys barely out of the teens certainly their outlook  was developed during their teens just shot and killed an innocent little  girl riding in a car in the seattle area when her mother who was driving  honked her horn at the car with the boys in it

this is really upsetting  and makes my stomach turn as it would any parents

doesnt your heart  just go out to that poor mother

 teenagers both drive cars and are involved in automotive vandalism and  crime

maybe someone on this newsgroup has had specific experience in  dealing with violent teenage offenders like these kids are

at the same it seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a case of violence by teenagers for a little perspective how about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local agencies to help children seniors the homeless

did you read about all the kids at stanford who spent their spring breaks helping out in inner city areas

what about the hundreds of volunteers  teenagers and others who worked to clean up the mess after the rodney king riots in la

have you gone to your local high school play recently

attended the school orchestra performances

have you seen how many kids volunteer to pick up trash plant trees do walkathons

how many kids have tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to

how many girl scout cookies have you bought

how many chocolate bars for good causes

the media picks up on all the anomalies the sensational what about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at school get good grades go to college or to work and make a real contribution to our society

all humans are teenagers at some time in their lives

mother theresa was a teenager and so was geoffrey dahmer

it is really sad to see so many people who buy the sensational reporting of the media as some kind of reflection of the world today

it is a reflection of what is happening on the outer fringes of our society and nothing more rf

a friend of mine and i saw and heard a viper and my friends first response was that it sounded like a truck

it sounded fine to me but then again i dont like the whiny noise that most modern sports car engines make

btw the viper we saw was moving at about mph just like all of the other cars on the  freeway heading east out of la on a friday afternoon

looked really nice though

 actually i was under the impression that the v in the viper was not the v that dodge was developing for its new kenworths

i have always thought it was the exhaust system and not the engine that produced the noise of a car

well yes the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out but the basics tone firing cadence etc

are determined by the engine configuration

in the case of the viper yes we are discussing a huge multicylinder deg

engine which will sound somewhat like a truck

and my understanding btw is that that v engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad aptible for either the trucks or the viper

and from what ive heard no first hand knowledge   its doing a pretty good job at both

and the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a degree dohc colombodesigned v period

the lockup only occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve mpg

mind you a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving mpg but the additional mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration vs locked converter clutch than its inherent losses take away

but that crx just one my heart with that body kit and spokes ps is richard out there somewhere

schludermannsscvxsscgov writes my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever

if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator  try agian

ive found that clutchless shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms 

i also skip gears some times using  

  sounds about right

i usually slip it out during throttledown and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right usually about a second and then slip it into gear

so how did you guys learn this

is it something you were born with or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few times

how many times

i would think youd have to have a certain amount of feel for it to begin with

some people would never get it and others like me would never have the guts to try it unless maybe you were planning to buy a new transmission anyway btw ive heard that quite a few truckers and race car drivers shift this way

 it shouldnt be that hard if you know much about digital electronics

if the counter is made with standard ttl chips all you should need to do is find the chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh youd also have to know what the conventions are for low and high

it might be a little more involved than this but it shouldnt be beyond someone with a bsee or bs eet

all the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using a translation table stored in rom

 nobody is using discrete ics to do these functions anymore if at all

i doubt any of the motor electronics had any to start with

much less ttl

i can almost guarantee that itll a fruitless attempt to figure out how bmw does it without breaking anything and invalidating any warranty on the car

if youre lucky youd still be able to start the car

 in article marcabotballtowncmacom weltycabotballtowncmacom richard welty writes   q what is ka band radar

where is it used

should a radar detector be  able to handle it

  a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us  in socalled photoradar installations

in these installations a  lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a  degree angle to the  direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the  radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit

 tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle

because of the low  power and the  degree angle many people believe that a radar  detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit  although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such  capability anyway

the number of locales where photoradar is in use  is limited and some question the legality of such units

best advice  learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they  are used or else dont speed

 photo radar and mailed tickets make no sense at all

speeding is a moving violation committed by the operator not the owner

the owner may be a rental agency a dealer a private party or a government agency

as long as the owner has no reason to expect the operator will be driving illegally or unsafely the owner cannot be held responsible for what the operator does

the car may even have been driven without the owners knowledge or consent

i cant believe a mailed ticket where the driver is not identified would stand up in court

this is obviously a lazy cynical boneheaded fascist way to extort revenue and has nothing to do with public safety

  bk  we had those fg photoradar things here in sweden a while ago

there was a lot of fuzz about them and a lot of sabotage too a spraycan with touchup paint can do a lot of good

eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of courtcases where the owner of the car could prove he didnt drive it at the time of speeding

i especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a carthief that had stolen a car and made false plates

he ofcourse chose a license number of a identical car so the photo seemed correct

in conclosion photoradar sucks every way you look at it

 markus

after agreeing to terms i signed the contract and drove home in my new car

later that same night i noticed that the terms in the were different from the terms i had agreed to

i made the stupid mistake of not checking everything on the contract

this all happened last saturday

i have heard that there is a coolingoff law allowing me three days to reconsider the contract

is this true

can anyone point me to the law

the transaction happened at the dealership if it matters

this cooling off period applies only in certain situations  lik ewhen you are solicited at home

i also think the cooling off period ends if you actually accept the merchandise

if this were not the case any car buyer would have the right to return a slightly used highly devalued car  days after buying it

yeah  thats the trick  if i want to buy a new car id have a firend buy  return one then go in and negotiate a better deal on a preowned used car

for discussion purposes only on the other hand if it can be proven its possible the changed terms could be thrown out

the question will be whether the agreement contains a merger clause

see ucc   parol evidence

if were talking about warranties then of course ucc   should be looked at

but we have so little information that none of us can say anything conclusive

i floored it and next thing i know i was pointing backwards

 this has me thinking

is there a biological reason why women cant put  their keys in their pants pockets like men do

i have two pockets on the  back of each of my pants

i put my keys in one and wallent in another

 many of the pockets even have a botton on them so i can close them securely

 everything is that much simpler for me

why cant women do the same

 is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and  a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents

oh pulleeze

its not biology at all its clothing design

womens clothing is generally designed to be as nonfunctional as possible

its only been in the last five years or so that you could buy womens pants with pockets deep enough to carry anything in

previously deep pockets were virtually unknown in womens clothing

skirts generally have better pockets now too

dresses espcially fancy dresses are still pretty hopeless

i often hand my drivers license over to my husband if were dressed up to go out somewhere so i dont have to be encumbered by a purse

if women consistently bought functional clothing and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional womens clothing i think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures

theres an interesting chapter in susan faludis backlash that described what happened the last time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional womens clothing

the manufactuing industry lost millions

 when i returned i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  get to me

when i finally got in there everything went smoothly until he  started adding up the numbers

he then discovered that they had  miscalculated the tax  license by about 

he then said he needed  another  from me

i said we had already agreed on a price and it was  their problem i wasnt giving them any more money

the finance guy then a similar thing happend to me a year ago

i bought a used ford bronco which has since been stolen   and few weeks after i paid and took delivery they sent a letter telling me they goofed and miscalculated the license renewal by  and that i need to send in a check to avoid further delay in the processing of my registration

the thing is i had already received the pink slip from the dmv so i ignored it

i received another letter and then the phone calls started coming

first from the finance guy and then from the general manager both hounding me for the extra money

they left me alone once i told them i already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause in the contract that stated that the final price was just that final

afterall they wouldnt budge if i had told them i wanted another  off after the deal had been signed right

i told them not to call again and that i would not do business with them in the future

they didnt seem to have a problem with that

this after all was a used ford at a toyota dealership

i had a much better experience buying a new pathfinder about a month ago

it certainly pays to buy a car on the last sunday of the month

and i have often observed when traffic is blocked solid that if a few people yeild to the moron who is impatiently riding bumpers the slug at the front of the pack will miraculously wake up change lanes and viola

no more jam

granted the situation here does not apply to rush hour in a crowded city

but i have observed this situation regularly on your average interstate six or eight sets of cars side by side bunched up in a pack with open freeway fore and aft as far as you can see

the people who refuse to yeild as a point of honor are just as annoying as the slug in the front

i agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you dont want to give them that one carlength when they should just wait like you are

but if youre one of those people that just sits behind the person and doesnt flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to go by and youre not just drafting them then get the hell out of the way of someone who will

i especially hate it when you flash someone at the back of a line and they dont pass it on

so after ive flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesnt pass it on and few if any do what next

on major highways  or more lanes in each direction keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who are entering

also as someone posted in this thread here in the dc area we have a few left lane exits sounds like 

if you wait until the last minute to get in the left lane you wont cause these yoyos wont make room

we have a particularly bad strech here in merryland just over the cabin john bridge

there are two very long entry ramps which all the hurryup yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead

when we get to the point where these ramps merge all hell breaks lose

the result is that traffic which was moving at  on the va side of the bridge stalls on tother side

if these dingbats had stayed in lane allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge we would still be doing 

instead we do start stop for  miles

frankly the saturn way of doing business and service was a very big plus

i hadnt bought a new car since i bought my honda wd back in  and i was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople i met

saturn was indeed very different

i made three different visits to the dealer where i bought my car and was never pressured

saturn also had the best aftersales support and the fixed pricing made it very easy for me to decide exactly what i wanted to buy

another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer

hes been fixing imports for  yearsand bought a saturn based on what hes seen and heard from his customers

saturn also has a good extended warranty program  for  yeark miles fully refunded if you dont use it

that works out to an actual cost of  or so based on the  year treasury rates

using savings account rates its more like 

in the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work without counting against the refund

i owned a  toyota celica gt

i decided to buy myself a gift  a more exotic car

front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche   model years

i narrowed it down to those two

i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche

the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance  almost a personal luxury car

it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 

i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the  but i decided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way

i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car

if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the  celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be  years newer

our lowerrisk division will continue to handle your account

if you buy the porsche  well have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double

and if you go with a  its another story again  well cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that

but the supra is much faster than the  and the  is actually faster than the standard 

that doenst make sense

thats what the book says

we dont insure corvettes either

for some reason the underwriters consider supras  and their drivers  as very traditional and conservative

i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons

the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure guy in the back room

at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance

i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft

 the part about spending  on repairs reminds me of an article i read in a magazine comparing the  year ownership costs of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that

the result which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period

that was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry

  now if i remember correctly the camry costs about  or so more in initial costs

essentially it means that you spend about  extra on repairs on the taurus

that is ridiculous

every time your car needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things

i would much rather spend  more in initial costs than spend  more in repair costs

did you account for depreciation

i seriously doubt that a taurus would rack up an extra  in repair costs over  years

you can rev that car all day everyday and youll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else

im not saying the quad  is a bad engine but dont highlight reliability when you comparing it to a acura engine

and while the integra costs alot more it is a a couple of things blowing a hose doesnt speak of engine reliability and while it is true that quads have a problem with head gasket leaks that was a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected

also i know pontiac is replacing head gaskets that leak for free for yeark miles

other than that i have found my quad to be completely solid and the direct ignition system means no wiresrotorrotorcap to ever deal with

also hydrolic lifters mean no valve adjustments ever

im not badmouthing the integra engine i just think you are going overboard on slamming the quad

do you have any evidence of blocks cracking on quads

im sorry i let mine go

i grew up in new york city so i rode in many checker cabs

the jump seats were fun as a kid

although the cars were roomy  a good trait for a taxi  they had a design flaw that i dont understand they never fixed the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the driver braked

i wouldnt want to take a long ride in the back seat of one of these vehicles

why did you like yours

i never drove one so i have to ask

from smartincbnewsmcbattcom stevencmartin subject re car buying story was christ another dealer service scam organization att distribution usa lines  from article aprnewsgatespsmotcom by markmbigfootspsmotcom mark monninger  this kind of behavior is what i was shocked by in my experience

for  crying out loud how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers  this way and still stay in business

again i dont expect sales people to  bow scrape and grovel in my presence but i sure dont expect to be  abused either

i was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to  me and in other negotiating sessions i overheard in neighboring sales  cubicles

evidently their success rate is high enough that they continue  to do business this way

there must be a lot of people out there who are  easy to intimidate

 a couple of months ago i went to a dealership to test drive a car

afterwards we sat down to discuss prices

i explained that i wanted a car just like the one i drove but in a different color

he said he could get one exactly like i wanted from the dealer network within a day

we then negotiated a price and signed the deal

next day i get a call

he explains that they goofed and they had neglected to take into account a price increase

the last price increase had occurred over  months prior to my visit

if i still wanted the car i would have to fork over another 

as an alternative they would honor the price if i bought the car i test drove which had been sitting around for  months and had a few miles on it

i said goodbye

this was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts

its too bad more people dont demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business

the next dealership i went to was straightforward and honest

first thing the salesman said was letss see what you have for dealer cost and work out how much profit i should make

the deal went through with no problems

i just started reading this thread today so forgive me if it has already been mentioned

butwhat was the deal with renaults putting the horn on the lefthand turnsignal stalk

it was a button on the end where the washer button would be on the wiperwasher stalk

could the frenchies not figure out the wiring through the steering wheel or what

ford tried that also back in 

my  ranger pickup had the horn at the end of the turnsignal stalk instead of in the center of the wheel where god intended it to be

 i drove two different cars then the other an  camry and never did get used to pushing the turnsignal stalk to blow the horn

the only time i got it right was when i was getting the annual staterequired safety inspection

from aaspocwruedu andrew a spencer subject re its a rush was re too fast organization case western reserve university cleveland oh usa lines  replyto aaspocwruedu andrew a spencer nntppostinghost slcinscwruedu in a previous article gwmsplsplloralcom gary w mahan says why should a good driver be terrified at mph

the only thing i fear going at  are drivers who switch to the left lane without using either rearviewmirror or flashers

doing  to  aint a rush for me but its fun and i get where i want to go much faster

 in defense of the drivers who are in the right lane

here in the states people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of mph

i dont think this is because they are stupid of course there are exceptions they are just programmed because of the mph limit

do you in the states when you look in the rearview always calculate future positions of cars based on a  speed differential

dont get me wrong i love to drive in the left lane fast but when i overtake cars who are on the right i slow down a tad bit

if i were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential i would be the stupid one

just to satiate my curiosity why would this make you the stupid one

it seems to me everybody should be aware enough of what is going on

you do not need to calculate the future position

you need to look at your mirrors a little more

if you glance around you will be able to tell how much faster than you the car is going

maybe not precisely but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to pass

i know what you are talking about about the other driver being startled because i myself have been startled by drivers cruising by at around mph when im doin 

the problem though as i saw it was not their fault for barreling around me but my fault for not paying the attention to my taskathand that i should have been

oddly enough since the nd timehappened x in around  mo

when id had my liscence for around  mo i havent been startledand ive been passed by cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car

another odd occurance is the fact that this only seems to happen on long tripsand if i drive along with them it doesnt happen at all  even on the long trips

 adrenaline will do that to youive had bad cop experiences with speeding so anything over the limit is adrenalizing for mescared ill get caught  maybe they should raise the limit so we can pay better attention just curious and my otwo drew

well there is a difference

i dont happen to have my sae manual handy but oil viscosity in general decreases with temperature

the sae numbers are based on a typical curve that oils used to all have running from say the viscosity of a roomtemperature weight at c down to say that of a roomtemperature weight at c for a typical weight oil

oils that are designed for operation in normal temperatures just have a weight specification

oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a w tacked on the end so in winter in a cold place youd stick w in your car in the winter and  in it in the summer to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year

modern multiviscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature

as a result their viscosity graphs cross over several curves

a multivis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures a normal operating temperature and a cold one though i cant remember the numbers

in any event the weights do indicate a significant difference

remember that your engine is temperatureregulated by the thermostat and radiator or air fins most of the time  unless you overheat it or something

any weight of oil is better than no oil or than very old carbonized oil

thin oil wont in general lubricate as well at temperature thicker oil will like a w will lubricate better at temperature but not as well during startup when most engine wear occurs

if youre planning on making long drives the w is probably fine esp

in the summer in your w car

but if youre making short drives stick to the w  dont drink soap

dilute dilute

i know that this isnt the group for it but since you brought it up does anyone have any idea why they havent bombed the waco cult

perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the batf shot first they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades not that anyone inside could have heard such identification after being near a concussion grenade and the announcement from the batf that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating  which was a search warrant by the way not an arrest warrant

in short perhaps because the batf is wildly out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a compound full of woman and children will not improve their position

there is a real chance that koresh will be able to prove selfdefense in court

that will leave  what

need you ask

liberty is not the freedom to do whatever we want it is the freedom to do whatever we are able

yes i have the same questions

what makes me upset is that r costs are skyrocketing and in fact cant be bought anymore in my area

also this is yet another way mechanics and dealers can ripoff customers

also i was reading that the new refrigerant is not compatible with the r system and that it would cost   upto a   to retrofit a car with the old r system

although it is important to consider the environment i think the sudden ban is a slap in the face for the consumer

why is it that the consumer should have to pay for the retrofit

the auto companies should have seen this coming

also why is it that the governments of the world were so quick in banning freon use and yet so slow in banning gasoline

in my opinion gasoline is just as hazardous as anything else

why cant they start proposing bans on this and switch to natural gas or electric

the technology is there

hopefully some chemist will come up with another alternative coolant that will be compatible with the old system

al h several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for r you dont hear about them because the mobile air conditioning society macs that is the people who stand to rake in that  to  per retrofit per automobile have mounted an organized campaign to squash those r substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether on very shaky technical grounds at best on outright lies at worst

ive done my clutch and miscellaneous little engine fixes

 the hardest part is usually getting the darned thing off the intake manifold

rebuilding a carb is fun if youre into things with lots of little parts

i used to rebuild them for all my friends cars in high school so it doesnt take a phd

buy a carb rebuilding kit from an auto supply store

buy a gallon of the best carb cleaning solvent you can find do they still make tyme

as a rule of thumb buy the one with the scariest warning labels

put it into a metal

bucket

make yourself a dipping can by punching holes in the bottom of a coffee can and attaching a wire handle to it

if the carb cleaner doesnt strip the paint right off the coffee can youre not using the right stuff

use the can to soak the little stuff and just hang the big parts from a coat hanger

wash them off with a garden hose wipe off excess water with paper towels and air dry

then remember where all the little parts go

follow the rebuild kits instructions concerning float height choke tension etc

bolt it back on the engine and admire the superclean carb on the filthy engine

heed this mans warnings

if you get carb cleaner this strong on your hands your hands will be eaten away

not pretty

 turbo in uk was good for mph

useful for blowing away vw beetles though i believe the beetle corners better

i can say without any doubt that i have never been blown away by any volvo ever

ive been blocked into a few car parks though by shithead volvo owners who only thought theyd be a few minutes

this does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car

not sure how long the small shitbox volvos last  too damn long

the worst car i ever drove was a hired 

in power handling and ride it was reminiscent of something from the s without the character

the  only ceased production a couple of years back

ive only been a passenger in the big volvos but that was enough

i ought to go for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts

oh well

i have to admit that the most disgusting feature of volvos is their marketing

it looks like volvo uses something like do you dare to risk your family in any car

attitude which is quite annoying in the long run

but now volvo has produced a new good car the volvo

hey nissan why arent you guys making any station wagons

you used to make a wagon on every platform sentra stanza maxima and now none at all

in fact they make some but they just dont sell them here in us

sunny california is a l wagon based on sentra

avenil is a l wdwd wagon it looks like infinity g but actually its independently designed to be a wagoni mean its not based on any sedans

nissan had better consider to sell them here

after buying my ser and really loving it i would like to buy another nissan product for my wife  but prefer a wagon ive owned minivans and dont prefer them

how about an altima wagon

or a sentra wagon would do

sounds nice

but i doubt they have a plan

coz avenil was introduced to replace any sedan based wagon

or heres an even better suggestion why dont you guys go ahead and buy the rest of fuji heavy industries subaru and put either an inline  or v into the legacy wd wagon

id buy the legacy in a minute if it had a nissan engine instead of the horizontal  that they seem sentimentally attached to

with all the camry accord taurus volvo and subaru wagons out there  its got to be a market segment that would be worthwhile

i can wait a year or two  but if you dont have something to compete by the  model i may have to go elsewhere

watch out for folks standing next to the road or on overpasses

they can cause serious harm to you and your car

just a cliffnotes version of my story follows pm last night i was travelling on the interstate here in knoxville i was taking an offramp exit to another interstate and my wife suddenly screamed and something large hit the side of my truck

we slowed down but after looking back to see the vandals standing there we drove on to the police station

she did get a good look at the guy and saw him cock his arm with something the size of a cinderblock but i never saw him

we are very lucky the truck sits up high on the road if it would have hit her window it would have killed her

the police are looking for the guy but in all likelyhood he is gone

i am a very good driver knock on wood but it was nighttime and i never saw the guy

the police said they thought the motive was to hit the car have us stop to check out the damage and then jump us and take the truck

i am interested to find out if there is any domestic car manufacturer especially gm and ford which produces bulletproof luxury sedans

color selection is limited though

the problem is that the guy at  penn

avenue is about to get it pres

clinton last time it was a lincoln this time a caddy

i am just wondering if this socalled bulletproof perhaps reinforced windows special materials for the bodyengineetc

luxury car  lincoln and cadillac models  is readily available to the public

not to my knowledge i know gm does conversion work for things like hot climates ie

the chevy caprices sold to the middle east but things like that are always done by third parties not the manufacturer

maybe you will need to buy a specific package that has beefedup everything perhaps the police cruiser package on the capricecrown vic and start from there

do we have to go through any special dealership to obtain these cars

i would really like to hear from anyone who has experience with the bulletproof cars

and i wuz drivin along in my armored seville sts and this punk pulls out of nowhere with an rpg rocket propelled grenade but the bulletproof windshield stopped him  dont think many people on the net have a need for bulletproof cars

check with local armored service companiessecuritybodyguard places

theyd know best

i think your average luxury car dealer will have a coronary if you told them ill take the blue caprice with options fz fuzzy dice pr power everything and ar armor

any information regarding the dealers and aftermarket shops that have bulletproof lincolns and cadillacs is greatly appreciated

you may email me at chsumtlmitedu or post the message in this newsgroup if you believe other netters might be interested as well

jimfcenterlinecom jim frost writes i wish i had the figures with me to back me up but i recall statistics showing that women tended to have more accidents than men but the damage was generally quite minor

men had fewer but far more expensive accidents

the rate of total vehicle destruction was significantly higher for men than women particularly in the younger male age groups

imho social considerations are probably the strongest influence here possibly more so than any difference between the sexes

social influences often affect the type of car thats bought and the situations the car is used in and the type of car and driving situations have a major effect on accident risk

thus if society expects you to buy a mustang and race it on the street youre more likely to do it and our society expects that of males more than females

i agree with some of your social influences such as driving conditions but lets get real here

guys dont drag race becuase there expected too we do it becuase its fun

and we find out whose car is faster

guys drive different than women becuase there men

when a driver is driving unusually i can usually figure out if it is a male or female driver without looking at the driver

social influences may give a person more reason to buy a vehicle that has a certain amount of character which he or she would like associated with

do you change your driving habits when no one is around

sheesh

i dont know what kind of women they have where you guys live but there are some ladies here who will blow your doors off

  i am the person who started out this subject

  to me the question really is not about dealer profit but the  amount of money for the type of car

ive settled with a  new  subaru wagon with the similar amount of money a saturn  dealer asked for a sw ok i know its a  model but i think  i got a better car though i have to adjust my initial idea of  why i am getting a new car

  today during a conversion with a friend i learned he rejected  a saturn for a ford tarurs as it only costed him a little bit more  than a sl

i may be wrong but a loaded tarus beats a saturn sl

i agree that a fullyloaded sl would come close in price to a lowerend ford taurus

a fullyloaded taurus on the other hand would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy sl

a fully loaded sl would run somewhere around  while a fully loaded taurus lx would be somewhere around the  range

a base taurus gl i believe might start around 

of course there is the taurus sho which can push  if you really try but this is a totally different car than your mainstream taurus sedan

your statement was not entirely faulty just a little inaccurate

  i cant see saturn is of better value and that is why i was puzzled  by its pricings

oh we did not spend much time getting our deals  being better informed has its advantages

this is not to say nobody wants the wagon anymore

  stuff about rhd desotos deleted well sweden and australia and lord knows wherever else used to drive on australians still do drive on the wrong side of the road

i believe sweden changed in 

the way i heard it was that they swapped all the traffic signs around one sunday the wrong side of the road so the export market might have been larger then than just the uk

 craig

i too was puzzled by this obvious untruth

what i think is going on is that nissan claims that the altima is the best selling new car namelplate in the us i think i have this near verbatim

lee iaccocas statistics dept

would have been proud of that sentence

 note that the corollaprism are also new designs but hey are not new nameplates

i guess nissan doesnt even sell as many altimas as toyota does corollas or there would be no nameplate qualifier

but waiiiiiit isnt nissan officially registering the car as far as government paperwork goes nissan stanza altima to avoid costly and lengthy paperwork

i read this on the net a while ago and someone actually may have said theres a little stanza logo on the altima somewhere

if i were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential i would be the stupid one

 just to satiate my curiosity why would this make you the stupid one

it seems to me everybody should be aware enough of what is going on

you do not need  i couldnt agree more

that is how it should work

people should also always see motorcycles too

 i constantly scan behind me i have one of those wink mirrors and two outside mirrors

i actually spend just as much time checking my six cops you know

 i still get caught off guard every now and then

  maybe i didnt word it right the first time

what i was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very high speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you you are stupid of course it depends on the circumstances

i have had some very scary instances when i assumed this and i dont think all of the fault was the other guy now if he was going  in a  thats a whole different story ok

i can agree to this because as we have both proved what is ideally supposed to happen isnt always

and even though im rearely the one doing the passing i dont see where it makes you stupid but i agree that if you think you are safe because the other guy is supposed to have been paying attention then yes you are just as dumb as the othermaybe dumber

from boylebbslsbnr ian boyle subject re what is  volvo  

organization bnr europe ltd lines  distribution world replyto boylebbslsbnr nntppostinghost bbslsbnrcouk  and all of these cars are driven fairly hard

none of them are at the head of  a line of cars going  mphthe first two spend a lot of their operating  life with the speedometer peggedand the only reason the  doesnt is it has  a  mph speedo  what i want to know ishave all you people who hate volvos been traumatized  by someone in a  turbo wagon blowing you away on the road or what

turbo in uk was good for mph

useful for blowing away vw beetles though i believe the beetle corners better

i can say without any doubt that i have never been blown away by any volvo ever

ive been blocked into a few car parks though by shithead volvo owners who only thought theyd be a few minutes

this does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car

not sure how long the small shitbox volvos last  too damn long

the worst car i ever drove was a hired 

in power handling and ride it was reminiscent of something from the s without the character

the  only ceased production a couple of years back

ive only been a passenger in the big volvos but that was enough

i ought to go for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts

if youre planning on making long drives the w is probably fine esp

in the summer in your w car

but if youre making short drives stick to the w several years ago gm was having trouble with the rings sticking on the

they would not honor warranty work if w was used if my memory serves me

in article qeeeosarmorycenterlinecom jimfcenterlinecom jim frost w rites  an audible alarm is just an annoyance  to either a professional or amateur

nobody listens to audible alarms anymore

the thieves know  this is why i think there ought to be a heavy fine on false alarms

im really honked off about the fact that due to all the cars with cruddy alarms crying wolf no one will pay any attention to my car if its alarm ever goes off for real

  depends on your area in the city nobody thinks about itbut at a mall or something near the suburbs people do at least glance over

remember an alarm is only a deterent not a prevention

if a thief sees two cars he likes one has an alarm and the other doesnt hes obviously going to skip the alarmed car and avoid the hassle

there is a way around every alarm but at least youve got something on your side

  apparently youre not a woman  my husband hates the auto door locks  features but forgets that besides families with children a woman  feels safer in a car that locks easily in addition to watching around   checking out if anyones near me when i get to my car  never park  in a secluded spot etc  have my keys ready to open the door so im  not fumbling in my purse looking for them    this has me thinking

is there a biological reason why women cant put  their keys in their pants pockets like men do

i have two pockets on the  back of each of my pants

i put my keys in one and wallent in another

 many of the pockets even have a botton on them so i can close them securely

 everything is that much simpler for me

why cant women do the same

 is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and  a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents

womens pants rarely have pockets and most when they do are too shallow to use

i is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when she goes from building to a car

it is protect herself from would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who as a definite place of safty ie a locked car

puting keys and walet looks ugly

it breaks the lines and makes you rear look wide as a cows

also to have the habits that work for any clothing situation the pruse functions no mater what you are wearing

even nude or a bikni a womens suit coat is lucky to have  pockets  on the outside none on the inside

i have mens coats that have as much as  pockets

this is definitally not fair

as one that wears both mens and womens clothes i can tell you womens clothes have few if any funtional pockets

when dressed as a man i put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and my keys in a coat outside pocket

it is much more covenent than the pants pockets and looks better

having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is paramout to a womans safty

men dont see this as a problem

a woman is aware of this every time she goes out

ie

image some red necks yelling at you we are going to fuck you

and the out weight you by  lbs and have  inches in hight on you

if you want to find out why a women does something live as one

in article buedu selickcsabuedu steven selick writes ive got an  plymouth colt that id like to do a frontend alignment on

is it possible to do without all of the fancy schmancy gadgets the pros have

how

steve nononono

if you do so you are putting the lives of others on the road at consider able risk

why do you think mechanics are ase certified

anyway you put it you need those fancy scmancy gadgets awww right you want all the home mechanics lined up against a wall and shot eh

bull pucky you chicken

read the service manual and get your head out of the sand

certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment rack that do the job as competently albeit not as swiftly if not more accurate due to the natural pride an ownermechanic places on his work

you can do an acceptable job of aligning a car using simple tools and some imaginative work that would never have the effect of endangering anyones life

the worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly well you could have the wheels aiming totally pigeon toed and not be able to steer the car raise your hands those that think their vision is so poor that they would screw up this badly

i bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wall with sand paper will kill millions of people

it aint magic

go take the certification course and look at the people that have never learned to add in their whole life that are taking the certification

btw i am disgusted at the colt and some of the other chrysler offerings because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them

my  chrysler laser similar to the daytona a reskinned colt needed a realignment every  months  bolt a good grade  x to each wheel using a carefully welded spacer jig

measure toe in adjust to manufacturer specs

camber a bit more difficult to adjust and measure 

i used a micrometer to measure the space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel hard to explain

this same tool could be used instead of the xs

i had made these tools up right after the last alignment done professionally so i had a reference that the original poster might not  ciao  mark

organization spectragraphics corporation distribution usa lines  i wrote is there a resource available to the consumer comparing all of the makes and models of automobiles trucks vans etc

 also ive found very little objective data comparing different vehicles for handling pickup braking expected maintenance etc

i recall years ago consumer reports annual buyers guide was much more informative in those aspects than it is now

thanks to a reply from someone i looked a little further and found what i was looking for

the april cr magazine has most of the above things

despite recent articles here the ratings looked pretty good for relative comparison purposes

unfortunately the crash test comparisons didnt include half of the cars im comparing

anybody know how  honda civic hatchbacks and toyota tercels fare in an accident

 boyd johnson noscspectracomjohnson san diego california  intermittent newsfeed at best and only to selected groups

my opinions certainly dont match those of my employer

this happened about a year ago on the washington dc beltway

snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass

four or five cars were hit

there were several serious injuries and sadly a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck in the head by one of the larger rocks

i dont recall if she made it but i think she was comatose for a month or so and doctors werent holding out hope that shed live

 what the hell is happening to this great country of ours

i can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but  pound rocks

has our society really stooped this low

yes

nobody is watching them

if they get caught there is no punishment at all

in the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping with a goodsized belt and then taken into some hospital to see first hand what kind of damage such accidents cause

of course this doesnt happen any more

that whipping would probably save the kids life by teaching him some respect for others

a person with that little respect would inevitably wind up dead early anyway

the problem is creeping gradualism

if you put a frog into hot water he just jumps out

but if you put him into cold water and then everso gradually heat it the frog will cook

this is what the entertainment industry and lack of religious moral and educational standards in our modern north american society have done to us over the years

now that we are about to be cooked we may have woken up too late

 erik velapold  society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams

the basic reason is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is no big deal

kids see hundreds on murderous acts on tv we can abort children on demand and kill the sick and old at will

so why be surprised when some kids drop  lbs rocks and kill people

they dont care because the message they hear is life is cheap

and the education system and the religious leaders arent doing much about it either

with both parents working in this society where is the stabilizing influence at home

latchkey children are everywhere

and these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to whatever violent hatepromoting music and videos they like because no one is home to stop it

this day and age when there is about  times more things to learn than when i went to school our answer to this increased knowledge is shorter school hours and more leisure time

i say keep the kids in school longer feed them good food and teach them something and when they get home have a parent there to interact and monitor them

there is a very old and now forgotten proverb a child left on his own will bring a parent to grief

daycare systems are not the answer

this is just shifting the parents own responsibilities off on someone else to whom its not a lifelong committment but rather just a job

ive found that it has to do with the way womens clothes are made

if you put keys in the front pocket of womens jeans or slacks you get a bulge that also tends to make it impossible to sit down because they stick you constantly

ditto in the back pocket

also try looking at the back pockets of womens jeans and compare them to the back pockets on mens jeans

they are usually if you buy jeans that you expect to last for any length of time about half the size

there flat out isnt room for a wallet or a bunch of keys

besides which where would men put all their crap if their wives didnt carry purses

 the same place single men do wallet in back pocket comb in other back pocket keys in front pocket knive in other from pocket pen in shirt pocket or front pants pocket

or do married men start carrying around a bunch of stuff to keep there women happy

the day was a sunday and everything was prepared in before

before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and after it was the white one that matters

the signs with arrows on was prepared with a left mode label that was torn off that night to reveal the new right mode arrow

hi all  brand new to the group so please no flames

honest opinions on jeep cherokee country not sport v ford explorer

my stepfather who ponders every major decision up to four months after making it is looking at one of the two

also please comment on the importance if any between wd and wd

we live in princeton nj and will barely ever take it off road

we learned with this last winter that we could really use something with a little more confidence in  inches of snow than an olds cutlass eightyeight

all replies appreciated hell be pondering this for a while

hes already decided on  cyl

over  so dont worry about that one thanks

steve i own a new ford explorer i really love it

i drove the jeep and besides the power i just didnt see spending the money for it

the jeep was great but i just love the explorer

in article qnlocsvelaacsoaklandedu mjepookiepasswayneedu michael j edelman writes the big disadvantage of automatics is the  hp they consume that never gets to the wheels

in this respect they are at a disadvantage to a manual

only when the torque converter is not locked up

there are autos out there with converter lock up in nd rd and th gears

dont forget that now that new  speed manual trannys are available the drive train is more optimally geared to get the most out of the engine

rare so are  speed autos but very real

bottom line is both manuals and automatics have vastly improved

i think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals

especially in shift intelligence

i say that a smart automatic is better than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right gear at the right time which to me is more important than torque converter losses

i prefer the stick for fun and the auto for traffic

who says you cant have your cake and eat it too

a well designed shifter will easily facilitate manual clutchless shifts

i am referring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate

the only department where you lose out is in the number of ratios available and of course the converter losses if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission it cant be half bad  eliot

from hamachiadobecom gordon hamachi subject re honda accord brake problem organization adobe systems incorporated lines  joni ciarletta writes  my honda accord just hit the magic  mile mark and now  all sorts of things are beginning to go bad

the latest problem  i am experiencing is with my brakes

they still stop the  car fine but once i am stopped completely my brake pedal  will sink another  or  inches all by itself

if feels really  strange and i am worried my brakes will quit working one of  these days

  i checked my brake fluid and the reservoir was full but the  fluid itself looked really dirty like dirty oil

i called  my mechanic and he told me i need a new brake master cylinder  which will cost me a whopping 

you are not alone

my  honda accord with  miles on it started showing the same behavior

i replaced the brake master cylinder myself

it took about an hour and cost about 

sure beats paying  to have someone else do it

if i wanted to rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one it would have cost only  to  for the rebuild kit

the honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to

two bolts attach it to the engine compartment

two brake lines enter the master cylinder

the tricky part was that the brake lines were stuck tight

my craftsmen open end wrench rounded off the bolt heads

i had to use vise grips to loosen those suckers

wow

best invention since sliced bread

after that it was very easy

bolt the new part in place add new brake fluid and bleed the brakes

this is quite easy even for a beginner

my local auto parts store had a repair manual for the honda accord it had detailed diagrams of the master brake cylinder and a stepbystep procedure for replacing it

 how do you take off the driver side door panel from the inside on an  honda prelude

the speaker went scratchy and i want to access its pins

 there is something going on here

it seems that once a month the vw group must have get a specific detailed question about hondas

i would like to ask that next month we get one about hyundai instead of honda

thank you

wrt performance converter lockup is purely irrelevant

the lockup only occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve mpg

mind you a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving mpg but the additional mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration vs locked converter clutch than its inherent losses take away

the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions i get much stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup which i can induce by briefly lifting off then quickly but not too quickly to trigger a kickdown applying throttle

above  rpms the convertor will never unlock it would kickdown first

who says theres no skill involved in driving an automatic

i think of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal

with my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my right foot while having both hands to steer

from eliotlanmolaengrwashingtonedu eliot subject re improvements in automatic transmissions keywords saturn subaru manual automatic articleid

 engrapr organization clearer than blir lines  nntppostinghost lanmolaengrwashingtonedu an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy

it switches to sport mode when the electronics figure it not when the driver sets the switch which is the proper way to do it imo

so what does sport mode entail

several things  revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy  delayed upshifts

ie

if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear

this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when theres another curve approaching  part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is depressed rather than the position of the pedal

modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode

this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red

my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough

also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at  in th gear of a  speed

how many  of people who drive manuals really know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation

im sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenarioratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do better

i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high gear low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high revs and small throttle opening

the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight

in article apropenconcom giandopenconcom deepak s gia nchandani writes  mubashir cheema   dont buy one that is the best way to avoid tickets  i used to have one and whenever a cop would pull me over see  the thing give me a ticket

one time my sister was driving  and had it in the glove compartment it was broken and she  got a ticket

in  i had received  tickets because of  it one for my sister so a total of five

  that was five years ago now i dont have one and have not  gotten a ticket

my driving habits have not changed  drastically

only two days ago i was going  mph on highway  with  mph limit cop saw me i break a little nothing  happened i was driving a minivan with my family in it

 otherwise i have cutlass supreme which i do  most of the  times on the highway

  so basically my opnion is not to get one if you do get pulled  over the cop will hear your excuse but if you have a radar  detecter he will not

again this has been my experienc   just get a remote model that is not visible to the cop

but be sure to get front and rear sensors  you can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop doesnt see it right awayvalentine is the best detector by far as stated by car and driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from

it also gives the amount of threats it is picking up so if you go through the same place everyday and it always goes off there you can glance at the number of threats the valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop

its about  and you can only get it factory directone problem

 my friend brought a subaru svx recently

i had drove it for couples times and i  think its a great car esp on snow

however when she took it to a local subaru  dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about  dollars

the dealer  told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to  disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour

 at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto  but found out the they are charging roughly the same price

so is there any  svx owner out there that has the same problem 

and if the oil change story is  true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me

by the way the car  looks great

 labour prices for car service are very expensive in toronto compared to other parts of ontario

ive still got  more years to pay on it

how does that get taken into account when i purchase my new car

does the dealership pay off my car and add on the amount they had to pay to the purchase price of the new car

someone please explain this to me

if you dont already know it you should call the bankcredit union finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the current payoff cost

if you are trading in your current car on the new car subtract the payoff amount from the tradein the dealer is giving you

if this turns out to be a negative number you need to reconsider the deal

subtract this difference from the price of the new car

this is the size of the loan you will need for the new car

the dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out of the money you give them when you pick up your new car

this time i happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there

the dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it

but i convinced them to fix it

this morning my  ford ranger was idling at  rpm

ok so i exaggerated a little but it was idling very fast

it has a  liter carburated engine in it and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal i dont think the linkage is stuck

what can i do to fix this problem

this has been a problem from time to time but has straightened itself out  until now

i dont have a tach but by gauging by the sound of the engine it is idling about twice as fast as it should be

this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up at a stop light

sometimes a bad choke pulloff diaphram will cause a car to fast idle

the pulloff which is vacuum actuated provides a necessary pull in noncold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam

locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle

if so locate the diaphram and test it

if you cant apply suction via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract then its bad and should be replaced

to date ive driven rabbits datsuns comets fords  a chevy

some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker  easier they where to shift

my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever

any help  in this is appreciated

thanks

 two shots at it  check the tires again  if you can see the wear bars youre down to problem area and some tires pass a penny test between the bars  thats no guide at all

your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning

you may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire  so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road

tires age

in particular soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles

harder compounds dont grip as well as soft ones

effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very often such as in competition but it hits all tires

you deserve to buy a nissan

this kind of behavior is what i was shocked by in my experience

for crying out loud how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers this way and still stay in business

again i dont expect sales people to bow scrape and grovel in my presence but i sure dont expect to be abused either

i was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to me and in other negotiating sessions i overheard in neighboring sales cubicles

evidently their success rate is high enough that they continue to do business this way

there must be a lot of people out there who are easy to intimidate

on the other hand im not sure about the one price no haggling approach that saturn and other are starting to use

i guess if their fixed price is fair its ok maybe the best approach is to do your homework before you go in

find out the invoice prices of the car add a reasonable profit for the dealer 

 offer them that price and stick to it

if they get abusive just leave

from wtmuhuraneoucomedu bill mayhew subject re electronic odometers was used bmw question 



organization northeastern ohio universities college of medicine lines  i consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer

the design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an eeprom

the idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the eeprom

the secondary purpose acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the eeprom being used

the microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the hall effect at a rate any higher than  mph so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable

this was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed  mph in operation

the case of course might not be the same for your  rx

the ecm modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated

since steering angle and velocity data etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers use of the car

i am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ecm

while it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars

i personally wouldnt mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion

  id like to add the beretta gtz as a car which will kick gsr butt  anyday and its a lot cheaper to boot   i will take this one with a definate grain of salt

performance data shows a   if this poster has some proofother than my friend blew one away last week    want proof

here is some data on acceleration and handling from motor trend apr 

  integra gsr beretta gtz   



 mile 



l acc gs 



slalom 



wrong why dont you look again at motor trends slalom times they are  right along with the integra and the car does that with small  inch tires that are all weather xgtv not to mention that the integra rides alot better than a beretta

your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine road  track and car driver have the gsr at 

to 

for road and track

also quarter mile times vary from 

to 

you cant tell exactly by the numbers

furthermore the integra will definately outrun the beretta on the high end

car  driver and road  track have the gsr doing  to  mph and it gets there fast

 so the beretta can out handle the integra and it can certainly keep up with it in acceleration

and the beretta probably has a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage  hptorque for the integra vs  for the beretta

you always believe those exact numbers why dont you drive a gsr and see for your self while the gsr has a low  torqye its high gearing over a  rpm make up for the difference still wouldnt call it a torque moster though

 the biggest advantage would have to be the price

the integra costs  as tested motor trend the gtz costs  as tested

the gtz also has standard nicities and airbag and antilock brakes

an airbag is not available on the integra and lower models do not have abs

considering you save almost  dollars for the beretta and the quad is a reliable engine it doesnt make sense to get the integra as a performance coupe which is what people have been trying to make it out to be

 quad  reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsthe acura has the engine wins the reliablity contest hands down

you can rev that car all day everyday and youll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else

i speak from expierence

im not saying the quad  is a bad engine but dont highlight reliability when you comparing it to a acura engine

and while the integra costs alot more it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better

and does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time

note this isnt a flame on the gtz or other gm quad  products

the berreta is a nice car and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention it has an airbag

but to start quoting figures from one source isnt too reliable

read other sources and drive both cars

while i havent driven a gtz i have driven gts and grand ams with quad  engines so they are similair

 change the oil filter too

 

check tires before going on the high way

and fill up the tank

 make that monthly or more often if you know one or more of your tires has a slow leak

if the tire has a leak you should fix it

 what others

thank you

  

check all fluids regularly every month check the oil every time you  fill up with gas

doesnt work too well if the engine is hot its more accurate to check the oil when the engine is cool ie

from gwmsplsplloralcom gary w mahan subject re its a rush was re too fast organization loral software productivity laboratory lines  why should a good driver be terrified at mph

the only thing i fear going at  are drivers who switch to the left lane without using either rearviewmirror or flashers

doing  to  aint a rush for me but its fun and i get where i want to go much faster

in defense of the drivers who are in the right lane

here in the states people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of mph

i dont think this is because they are stupid of course there are exceptions they are just programmed because of the mph limit

do you in the states when you look in the rearview always calculate future positions of cars based on a  speed differential

dont get me wrong i love to drive in the left lane fast but when i overtake cars who are on the right i slow down a tad bit

you also dont read that much about violence against teenagers such as george bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed iraqi yearolds who were trying to surrender with bulldozers

on the other hand i think it is true without singling out teenagers for blame that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be

those of us whod like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do with people of all ages

race car stuff deleted back to the f stuff for a second note that the auto tranny in f still shifts at the drivers command not some preselected schedule

the driver still controls the shifting not the transmission

 now there is no dispute that in production cars automatics are  inherently more lossy than manuals

that is in theory

my point all  along is that whatever mechanical advantages a manual has over an  automatic can very easily be lost by a driver who isnt skillful or one thing that gives an automatic an advantage at launch is the fact that it has a torque converter vs a clutch

i know this sounds strange but a torque converter multiplies the engine output when launching

it functions   as a sort of limited continuously variable transmission

typically you get a torque multiplication of  to  times depending on the stall speed

i have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile

such systems do exist but none are presently installed in production autos that i am aware of

these are commonly called viscous drive cvts or fluidic amplifiers

contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered result is no tq mult what the convertor does allow is for the engine to be closer to its torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage its driveline

chevy proved it many years ago with the  camaro ets and terminal  mile times were close enough tpo be identical for  speed and auto cars

note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can get away with fewer gears than a manual the slip in the convertor makes up for the fewer ratios and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed  sspeed autos soon to be out note that some manufacturers are using  speed manulas now

once past lauch however the converter begins coupling and the tq multiplication effect is reduced but by then you should be on the cam

the part cost  outside but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts

he suggested i wait till it malfunctions before i do anything

 any help would be greatly apprecisted  thanks i sold my  sprint last april with k on it

id driven it since the previous july putting k miles on it

the sensor light used to light up regularly starting about k miles after i bought it

my brother and i rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment so i suppose the sensor could have used replacement

although reverse lights on the sides are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the path of the car i dont think warnings were their original intents since they are colored white

i just ordered a saturn sl after considering a few imports

frankly the saturn  stuff deleted saturn also has a good extended warranty program  for  yeark miles fully refunded if you dont use it

that works out to an actual cost of  or so based on the  year treasury rates

using savings account rates its more like 

in the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work without counting against the refund

mike  in general extended warranties are a ripoff

this yrk is really only yrk because you get the yrk one free with the car

also is there perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty

also are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty

and if you use it at year  for some  buck job and pay a  deduct and then you have used it so no refund ever

again extended warranties are ripoff high profit items for the dealer

 most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators and ive never seen nor heard of a vandal opening one

i imagine that there would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have to crawl furthur under the car to open it

in article mwfbwwnjccwisdombubbleorg joncnjccwisdombubbleorg j on cochran writes   id like to add the beretta gtz as a car which will kick gsr butt  anyday and its a lot cheaper to boot comparing the gtz and gsr is apples to oranges somewhat like a mustang 

and a crx both have very different ways of doing things and ought to appeal to different buyers ie i dont think an acura owner would be seen dead in a chevy dealership or vice versa

stuff deleted are all weather xgtv not to mention that the integra rides alot better than no integra i have seen comes with allseason tires

the gtz does come with much bigger  wheels

along with the integra and the car does that with small  inch tires that your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine road  track and car driver have the gsr at 

to 

for road and track

the cd figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype supplied by acura

the mt figures are more plausible

also quarter mile times vary from 

to 



sounds reasonable probably faster than regular integras

 so the beretta can out handle the integra and it can certainly keep up with it in acceleration

and the beretta probably has a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage  hptorque for the integra vs  for the beretta

you always believe those exact numbers why dont you drive a gsr and see for your self while the gsr has a low  torqye its high gearing over a  the gsr gearing is horrible for day to day driving

it needs a  speed box more than any other modern car

essentially th in a regualr integra equals th in the gsr and the regular integras are very buzzy at speed

rpm make up for the difference still wouldnt call it a torque moster though

 considering you save almost  dollars for the beretta and the quad is a reliable engine it doesnt make sense to get the integra as a the only person i knew with a gtz had it bought back by gm as a lemon

it was a piecve of junk but very quick for fwd

quad  reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect the only gsr owner i know had the engine throw a rod with less than k miles a rare screw up by honda

both the gtz and gsr are flawed cars

the performance enthusiasts would take the gtz and the cr purchase would be the gsr

craig

  its great that all these other cars can outhandle outcorner and out  accelerate an integra

  but youve got to ask yourself one question do all these other cars have  a moonroof with a sliding sunshade

lines  i prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be

i believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive

automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy

more time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road

the manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something granted it isnt a large movement

plus driving should be fun

driving a manual is fun driving an automatic is a chore

in the case of shift speed automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick

if i was racing id want and automatic

for normal driving go with the manual

it really depends on whether you are talking model year or date of manufacture

liter models

in  they went to 

liter and there was only a single model the sc think of it as a cross between the s and the carerra models

note all the above are based on model year not date of manufacture

i stand corrected

this is all from memory mind you  as for the rev happy behavior the earlier cars are even more prone to this

the 

liter cars used low compression engines and suffered a bit in this regard

the early

reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up

they arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail lights

  craig perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights are for couldnt we agree that they serve the dual purpose of letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse and that they can also light up the area behind your car while youre backing up so you can see

backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars

those on my taurus wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car and theyre much brighter than those on my earlier cars from the s and s insofar as vettes having side backup lights look at a  or  model or perhaps a year or two earlier too and youll see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the cars hindquarters

 mihir shah ralph bean hprndrosehpcom

 well i guess i know for sure what i meant and it is this i dont know where you drive but around here freeways are often clogged solid with large packs of semis trucks and cars of all descriptions

when i close on one of these rolling clusterfs on the highway i have no desire to add my vehicle to this rolling accident looking for a place to happen

if there were any way to pass it i would be passing myself however i cant

as i posted before all it takes is a blown tire or some moron tramping on the brakes to turn this pack into a cloud of shredded metal flying glass and burning vehicles

i want to maintain enough free space between myself and this mess to at least have a minimal chance to avoid a mass crash

that means maintaining a clear space between me and it

however there is no end of shortdriving morons who are dying to pass so they can add themselves and their car to the bodycount

that wouldnt bother me so much except that after letting enough of these morons pass me and glue themselves to the pack ahead my interval is filled up

trying to back off further does not work because the road behind me has filled up trapping my car right into an ever increasing pack

now if there was any slight possibility that there was a lane open ahead id be glad to move over

but there usually is no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere

so i block the wouldbe passers

not only for my own good  but theirs as well even though they are often too stupid to realize it

 just an comment i dont like it when people decide whats good for me

if you think youre going to decide anything for me youd better be carrying a badge and a gun

who made you capable of determining if there is no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere

why do you find it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own business

if someone is minding their own business i will give them all the room they want and ill try to make things easy for them even letting them in in front of me if they ask politely with a directional

on the other hand if someone like you decides they want to block me and be a general asshole you can bet your ass that ill make life as miserable as possible for you as long as it doesnt affect anyone else whos minding their own business

they have a phrase to describe someone like you self appointed traffic police

just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong

as a rule of philosophy i dont feel particularly sorry when somebody gets offed by his own stupidity but it does worry me when some idiot is in a position to cash in my chips too

they arent really at the same point along the suv spectrum  not to mention price range

how about the explorer trooper blazer montero and if the budget allows the land cruiser

bear in mind that  of all suvs purchased never venture offroad

 carolinafanuiuc ckauxacsouiucedu wrote   i have been active in defending saturn lately on the net and would   like to state my full opinion on the subject rather than just reply to others   points

    the biggest problem some people seem to be having is that saturn   dealers make k on a car

i think most will agree with me that the car is   comparably priced with its competitors that is they arent overpriced   compared to most cars in their class

i dont understand the point of   arguing over whether the dealer makes the k or not

  i have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either

 the only thing that i can figure out is that people believe that if  they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket  expenses for the car

while this may be true in some cases i do not  believe that it is generally true

i bought a saturn sl in january of 

 at that time based on studying car prices i decided that there was  no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the saturn

sure maybe i  could have talked the price for some other car to the saturn price but  my outofpocket expenses wouldnt have been any different

whats important  to me is how much money i have left after i buy the car

reducing dealer profit  is not the same thing as saving money

show me how reducing dealer profit  saves me money and ill believe that its important

my experience has  been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money

  fred say you bought your saturn at k with a dealer profit of k

if the dealer profit is  then you would only be paying k for the same car

so isnt that saving money

moreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by  then their cars will be even better deals

say if the price of a saturn was already  below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be  below market average

it will  attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money

force the competitors to lower their prices to survive

now not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyers for other cars will pay less

isnt that saving money

subject aftermarket cruise controls specific questions from mikewcancbyuedu md

mike wieda organization byu nntppostinghost  lines  howdy im a little new to this newsgroup but i would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here

the subject aftermarket cruise controls the background i recently broke my ankle in a roadbicycling accident  places five screws yuk

 

in two weeks i will be returning to texas my home from my school byu in provo utah

as you can imagine trying to drive nearly  miles with a broken right ankle isnt just the epitome of a good time

my car does not have a cruise control so i would have to do all the pedalling ha ha with my messedup ankle

my question what is the general opinion of aftermarket cruise control units

i realize that a cheap cc cruise control from say pep boys isnt going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a thing

and i uderstand that i probably cant expect much in the way of accuracy looks and that sort of thing but anythings gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle

i have a  jeep cherokee  speed standard  l engine with ketteringsp

ignition yknow distributor cap rotor that setupnot electronic

maybe you couldve guessed it being an  but im just trying to give information as completly as i can

i found a cc unit for  bucks

it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servormotor

is this good or bad

if i did buy this cc which vacuum hose should i tap

it has two speed sensors one magnetic and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pickup or so i understand

i can use either one

which is best

the manual says i read it in the store today that the magneticaxle setup is more accurate but harder to install

is there really a big difference

it has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other ccs but does not have a sensor for the clutch pedal

so if i wasnt paying real close attention i might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up

which would wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off

im pretty coordinated so this doesnt bother me if it were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but im ok with it

the installation also calls for an attachment to a steadyon brake signal and a switchedon brake signal

i think i can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse

am i right

but im not sure where to get the steadyon brake signal or for that matter what exactly it is

any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it

i think i can figure the other things out

like how to hookup the negative side tachtype sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and all that miscellaneous business

but i need a little help with 

is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a device



is there any particularly good aftermarket cc



are professionally installed ccs signifacantly better and worth the cabbage



if the unit i saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just that it is at pep boy and its  is sufficient for my simple needs how do i get the thing installed properly specifically the questions above

my father and i built a veep volkswagen powered jeep cja when i was in high school so i consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and cars

so the installation doesnt scare me

i just want to be certain that i get the thing installed correctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my veep

 i appreciate your time in reading my post and i would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject

if you would like to share some of your wisdom please email as i dont get over this group very often but i check my mail all the time

again thanks for any help anyone may have

the same info turns out can be found in the iwii manual p  in the  version but i didnt really trust that

does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary

just wondering

theyd have to be callable from think pascal to  replace the one  and two  dimensional ffts routines in an already  existing program

i own an lciii and i recently heard an interesting rumor

  i heard that the lciii has a built in slot for a powerpc chip

  is this true

i heard that the slot is not the same as the pds   slot

is that true

    thanks   david mirsky   mirskygnuaimitedu   well i also have an lc iii

popping the top revealed   one socket for an additional vram simm   one socket for a pin ram simm   one socket for a flatpack fpu   a processordirect slot pds identical to the lclc ii but with  an additional set of connetions to one side for the full bit  data path that the lclc ii lacked   thats it

i guess a board with a powerpc chip could be made that would fit  in the pds but thats the only place

 so will it be possible to have a nubus or pds powerpc upgrade or will it require a logic board swap

it would be interesting for apple to come out with a nubus powerpc that allowed use of the cpus x like rocketshare

but i guess thats getting a bit fantastic

i was wondering since macweek reported that developers were seeded with powerpcs on a nubus card

also any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed

last i heard the estimates were around  times the speed of a quadra in native risc mode

i heard an apple employee mumble something about the arrival of powerpc machines at a much earlier date that q  but i doubt its true

finally is the powerpc developers cd minicourse available

i saw it advertised in the developers university calendar and id like to know if its at all interesting

i am thinking about buying an external monitor for my se and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me

i am mostly thinking about a  color monitor and an  bit card that can switch between  and something higher like 

i read an old report on a card from lapis that could do this but could not use the external monitor as the main screen with menubar which to me is a major draw back

has this perhaps been fixed

or can any other cards do this like the micron xceed 

also which monitor should i buy

at the moment i am leaning towards the sony  s or  what exactly is the difference between these

but are there any other good cheap monitors i should know about

doesnt the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions

please send me email and ill summarize

i would also greatly appreciate getting the email addresses of any mail order companys that sell monitors or cards

replyto petrackvnetibmcom disclaimer this posting may contain no views at all newssoftware usenet 

lines  i have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection between a mac duo  and a pc

i have used mackermit and versaterm on the mac side

i have used procomm kermit and softerm on os on the pc or ps side

i have used nonhardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables

and know my hands are shaking from the effort

nothing has allowed file transfers from the mac to the ps

in general i can type back and forth with no trouble but only if both sides are set to speeds over  baud

i cannot send files from the mac to the ps at all and file transfers from the duo to the ps are not possible

when i do a straight ascii send i can send from the ps to the duo flawlessly

i can send binhex files this way quite fast and i know that the transmission is error free

but straight ascii sent from the mac to the ps is full of errors

unless of course i do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing

well like  times faster than human typing

i would like to hear from anyone who has been able to transfer files from a duo  to a ps via modem or null modem

if you can do it please tell me your exact combination of hardware and software

obviously i am talking of a true serial port modem not the express modem

maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a duo  can check this out for me

right now i am of the opinion that it wont work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the duo and it wont work at low speeds because of some crazy reason i dont understand

could i hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a duo  fast

like via a modem or via a sysex dump

could anyone with a duo help me out

i am going absolutely insane

i wanna know if the problem is my duo or all duo s or all duos or just me

yes i have checked the cable  times

and not only can i type back and forth but zterm alerts the users if she uses hardware handshaking and cts is down

so i know that hardware handshaking is working

and also according to zterm port stats the buffer never overflows

please help me figure out whats going on scott petrack petrackhaifascvnetibmcom

my pli m syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id switch on the outside of the case

where do i connect this switch

can the computer just tell with internal drives

i noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard i didnt look closely but i seem to recall it laying over the ram thats soldered onto the motherboard

would that cause problems

one last question

is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover

the drives front panel is smaller than the space left in the case the drives panel is the same size as the spotsbm clones cases

should i just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place

makes you wonder why intel ever made a chip to begin with

wouldnt you like a powerbook alpha running about  mips

cool idea

sorry  wrong

it would be an extremely hot ideaat least with the current alphas

the available alphas run up to  mhz

but they produce quite a bit of heat

in fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat sinks

from btsrockconcertnet bruce t smith  personal account subject disappearing hard drive in lc

organization concertconnect  public access unix lines  the internal hd in my lc disappeared for a day last week and id like to hear any reasonable theories folks can suggest for what happened

it is an lc with mb of ram and an mb internal drive running system  with a few scsi devices in a so far as i know properly terminated chain

i had shut down the system for a day i was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year and upon restarting got a blinking question mark

i booted from a floppy and saw that my external hd seemed okay but there was no sign of the internal

i installed a system folder on the external and was indeed able to boot from it

i tried things like disk first aid and silverlining to inquire about the internal drive

they either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it

silverlining claimed it was a connor drive but it is a quantum  well id backed things up so i was able to work

but at some point i noticed that the internal had reappeared

now disk first aid says that alls well etc

things seem to be fine

but what happened

was this a warning that something the internal hd or something else is about to die

im definitely nervous

and if this is a signal that the internal hd is sick is it true that i can only put up to a mb drive inside an lc

some folks have claimed theres a limitation in the lc othern size or power while others and that includes lacie over the phone say anything that fits is okay

both architectures are nearing then end of their lifetimes

heres why people have hounded apple for a notebook with a  processor in it

apple cant deliver that right now because the  saps too much power radiates far too much heat and is too large for a notebook

how does one get around that without designing a new chipset

use existing powerbook technology to your best advantage

the duo dock gives apple a unique ability to give users that  power in a semiportable fashion

by plunking the  into the dock youve got quadra power at your desk

on the road that mhz  should be able to handle most of your needs

okay not the best solution but its an answer to a nowin situation

 so does this mean one will be able to use the powerbooks processor in parallel to the docks processor

to keep costs down and speed up most macs have only  or  bit display capability builtin but most of those can be expanded to display bit color

presently quickdraw is optimized for  dpi display quickdraw qx will change this

in addition quickdraw allows in macs with a nubus slot more then one monitor to be used in any combination from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures

vram video ram

standard for present nonpowerbook macs handling of builtin video from a bit color palette

vram provided runs a bit color x display expandable to bit color or a bit x display

sound output standard in all macs since the k stereo sound became standard with the se

ibm even though pcs have rom bios definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware nan zou the use of drivers bypassing bios video hareware inconsitancies see super vga below and nonstanderzation of clone bios have left resolution of video display hardware os and program interaction up to the os and video hardware in question faisal nameer jawdat

in addition ibm and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present matt healy nor a standardized screendrawing toolbox like macs qd

as a result the os must be very well written to detect some modes especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly at present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program os print driver and monitor card that editing bit pictures regardless of color mode os and monitor typecard combination as one can do on the mac is impossible with an ibm

for example one cannot edit a bit color picture done on a os  with a svga monitor on a  with vga bit color palette and dos 

and still have all the colors one started out with

later ibm machines will have integrated graphics accelerators faster processors and modular upgradeability and may have builtin sound cards cd rom and ethernet pc week

common on the initial ps implementation from ibm and some ps models

svga super vga this is not a standard in the way the others were but instead was a catch all category for a group of video cards

as such with each manufacturer using their own implementation scheme svga was chaos with people debating as to what is svga and what is not

in an effort to make svga more of a standard vesa was established and is used in the newer units but things are still a mess

video is either k  or m today resolution of x and x at  and  colors are common newer ones since  have the sierra hicolor ramdac giving bit  colors at x some of the very newer ones  can do  bits per pixel usually at x

speedwise too much variation some very slow western digital paradise based for example some very fast s c based for example some are soso like tseng et a very popular chipset

some limiting factors overcome by mhz vl bus  s linear address mapping were 

mhz isa bus at architecture where the cpu looks at the card through a k window etc

other nonsvga standards a ibms own standard interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions like linedraw polygon fill etc

in hardware

some clone implementations from ati are the fastest video available today though some clone models do not have interlacing

tms high end graphics coprocessors usually  some do bit speeds up vectororiented graphics like cad

xga extended graphics array newer and faster than a only available for mca busbased pss clones are coming out soon

emulates vga ega and cga dct

max resolution at xxb same as a also some  bpp modes

xga accelerates graphics functions up to  times faster than standard vga in windows and os including line draws bit and pixelblock transfers area fills masking and xy addressing

has an intelligent way to detect and co exist with other xga cards so multiple desktops like on the mac may not be far away

since this is an architecture its resolution and color depth isnt fixed ibm implements only bit  color while other companies can have bit color through ibm technical licenses

expansion both mac  ibm scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm

allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubus card expansion mac plus only some monitors and cdrom

main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and at the end

any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm

scsi  devices per scsi controller

bit asynchronous mbs ave and synchronous mbs max transfers

difference is due to scsi software drivers

fast scsi is a misname for bit scsi in scsi mode see scsi for details

scsi  devices per scsi controller in scsi mode

scsi is fully scsi compliant and bit scsi tends to be implemented as a very fast scsi since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that  and bit scsi do

transfer speeds are mbs with mbs burst bit mbs with mbs burst bit and mbs with mbs burst bitwide and fast

since bit scsi can use scsi software drivers and hardware at bit scsi speeds and as such is limited to  devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast scsi

bit fast scsi requires a scsi software driver and scsi electronics but can still use the scsi ports

wide bit and bit scsi require a different scsi port electronics and software driver from scsi which makes them more expensive than other scsi interfaces

mac scsi asynchronous scsi builtin standard since the plus

even though apple developed some specifications for scsi controlers the os scsi manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both scsi interfaces

as a result present scsi macs use bit scsi as a fast asynchronous scsi

presently quadras are the only macs with a scsi controller chip builtin digital review oct   v n p though they lack some other parts of the hardware like the wide scsi port interface

since other macs require a nubus card to use scsi older nubus macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus and cpu

rumorsome cyclone macs june will come with a wide  fast scsi port standard and have a rewritten os scsi manager

ibm scsi scsi is not too wide spread yet generally not bundled with systems except as addon eisa and vesa local bus adapters avalable

like the mac bit scsi is used as a very fast scsi by most controllers out there

unlike the mac ibm has no exact scsi controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for scsi

mac memory expansion with a few exceptions the mac has used nonparity pin bit simm memory expansion since the plus

while pin bit parity simms could be used in these macs only special iicis could make use of the parity feature by convension both simm types are called pin simms

the iifx used pin parity simms

the lc iii c and q all use a new pin simm that is accessable by bits at a time and is used in ibms

the mac does a complete memory check at startup by writingreading every memory location if something is seriously wrong with a simm the mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is

since macs made before feb   managed memory baced on data path simms had to be installed in pairs bit or in sets of  bit

the centris  and quadra  eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one simm at a time

if the simms are the same size are used then the memory is interleaved across the two simms resulting in a  performance boost on ram access macworld apr

this is like having two or more macs in the same box able to dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved each nubus card needs its own memory but most nubus cards of this type come with mb ram simms on the card standard

ibm memory expansion parity simms nonparity simms some newer models do a mac like simm memory check or a dozen or so different types of memory boards

hd interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of development mfm modified frequency modulation rll run length limited only used with smaller  mb hard drives

oses assumes full installation print drivers fonts multifinder etc

and multiple application use

mac k to mb of os and hardware commands have been put into rom

this allows apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the mac os quickdraw menu commands print mouse scsi  sound drivers etc in rom which require clone makers to use the rom chip or read rom on to disks which requires access to the proper mac since different macs have slightly different rom chips plus vs classic for example

with key hooks for the os support interface in rom programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk os has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and therefore can write smaller programs

this also allows apple greater control over hardwaresoftware standards and that the disk os can be smaller and with some of the tookbox command code in rom with lower ram requirements then a totally disk based os

the installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system fonts from the previous system inside the system file

this can eat up any ram benefits and cause other problems

apple itself recommends removing all fonts from the system file

aux 

unix needs mb ram mb suggested mb hard drive and a  or  equivalent to run

this bit preemptive multitasking os is large due to being unix and needing translators between it and the mac roms

price 

note sound output was supported in oses 

to  by many formats including the following snd wave asnd fssd qssn smsd soun dcd and dcfl

in  the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards snd and aiff which causes some playback problems for the old formats though most still play

ibm machiness have little gui code data and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with so most of the coding must be provided in the os

since hard disks were slow the disk os code is read into ram

in addition what little rom code there is also read into ram a process called shadow rom this results in faster implementation since ram is faster then proms or eproms

having most of the os code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a rom based system due to the patches needed

in addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is needed

side note the ftc charged that microsoft formed a os trust by not providing all feature documentation for its oses to developers outside ms and designing its windows and dos apps to fail under os undocumented windows and there is deliberate code in windows nt beta which causes the install to abort if os boot manager is present gregory hicks infoibmpc digest v 

due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the ftc judicial council for action against microsoft was a tie which resulted in no action

os number crunching mel park mac arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment sane or standard apple numerics environment

floating point numbers are  bits long when an fpu is present and  bits otherwise

exceptions such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent manner

 produces the internal representation for infinity inf

 produces zero

the above treatment of  occurs in an fpuequipped machine even when sane is bypassed and the fpu programmed directly

ibm floating point numbers are bits with a hardware fpu bits when emulated

the way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a program

on older dos complilers exceptions could cause program aborts  and  would abort to the dos prompt at the point where they occured

most present compilers handle this better

result there is little consistent handling of numbers between dos windows and os programs nor between programs for just one os

networking includes printing wysiwyg printing can be a problem with either mac of ibm machines especially if one sends truetype fonts to a older style postscript printer

mac hardware builtin localtalk network port and a builtin printer port

localtalk has moderate speeds 

kbs requires special connectors for each machine  and up and can be run off of either the printer port to include very old macs or the network port standard today

builtin ethernet is becoming common but many older macs require a pds or nubus card at about  for each machine

these cards provide three connectors and transceivers thick thin and baset for ethernet

the macintosh quadra family and some centris models includes ethernet interface on motherboard with transceivers available

tokenring has been a network option since 

software appletalk the suite of protocols standard with mac os which can use variety of media types

appleshare client software included with the os as well and can connect to file servers such as novell netware com open banyan vines dec pathworks apples appleshare servers system  file sharing machines and afp servers running on variety of unix hosts

the same is true of connecting to servers

printing bugs monaco truetype font is different then the screen bitmap font

quickdraw qx is suppossed to fix this and similar problems

ibm hardware localtalk not widely used ethernet and tokenring

software novell netware banyan vines decnet windowswork groups appletalk protocols and appleshare subset of appletalk

each of the msdos networking schemes are in general totally incompatible with the others

once you have chosen one you are pretty much lockedin to that product line from then on

windowswork groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this problem

novell netware is the biggest  percent of the corporate market

and in general is more powerful and offers better controlmanagementsecurity than appleshare but its also more complex to set up and manage

this will change due to the use of the mac finder and file management system by novell

pc week    infoworld dec  macweek  printing very os dependent dos if its a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port and dont worry about it tweeking may be needed with poorly written software

network printing is not controlled by the system but is mostly implemented by the actual program therefore performance varies from one software program to the next

windows x supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs in the print queue but it always lists printers as active even if they are not

this becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers on the same net because theres no way for software to reliably determine which printer is active right now

windows for workgroups is more maclike and intelligent about this

os maclike the os deals with printers with apps making calls to the os

printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above oses do not have wysiwyg printing

this is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the os involved

price issue this is very dynamic with mac providing more buildin features than ibm and ibm being more get only what you need then mac and price wars by both worlds

the ibm machines modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware standarization which in turn requires oses and programs to be very complex to handle all the variation in hardware

when one adds all the standard mac hardware features to an ibm builtin inputoutput sound support scsi pds builtin monitor support builtin networking standard mouse interface and nubus  in higher machines the mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent equipted ibm machine especially since some ibm monitors can be used with macs which cuts some more of the macs cost macuser aug

my solution was to get silverlining

none of  the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives  in fact the only loop that worked was the macintosh  software loop whatever that means

  i doubt this is a quadraspecific problem

i had to get  rid of my venerable bernoulli  last year with enough  cartridges purchased at  each to make the whole thing  worth more than my whole computer 

the tech support guys  at ocean microsystems suggested that some thirdparty drivers  might fix the problem  in my case the cartridges wouldnt  formatmountpartition for aux

all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my mac plus and my powerbook 

it was for this reason i assumed the problem had something to do with the quadra

even with the quadra they mostly worked ok

the problem occurred when i ejected a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes saying this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware even though there was no cartridge in the drive

if you have a tmpl for the correct resource i would be grateful to receive it

that way i could play around a bit and maybe get my duo to do something useful with its serial port

other than appletalk

btw i believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is  bytes that that means increasing the buffer will help if you are using hardware handshaking

i can cram text data pretty fast into my duo and can monitor that cts is being lowered but the buffer never gets beyond  out of  bytes

pds is better than nubus for most people in most applications

granted there are more nubus cards

but most applications that require a nubus card like fullmotion video capture shouldnt be done on an lclciilciii anyway

 mark nubus is a much more robust system for system for installing multiple cards without configuration problems

i know that when i was checking into expasion options for an si there were a number of pds video cards that would not work with certian dual slot cache adapters

from richrubellaunchpaduncedu rich rubel subject ps appletalk card question nntppostinghost lambadaoituncedu organization university of north carolina extended bulletin board service lines  i have a chance to buy a used ps appletalk card to create a network with my home machines

however the guy who has the card tells me theres a db or db cant remember now on the back of the card rather than the pin or pin minidin that i expect

this sounds more like a thicknet ethernet card

should there be a transciever on it like on the quadras

what would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of these cards keeping in mind that its microchannel architecture which means take your best guess and double it

  i would like to buy a  bit adc card for the mac ii with digitization  rate of at least  khz preferably  khz

i would prefer one with  good differential and integral linearity and dma would be a plus

other  than national instruments do you know of any other vendor who sells such  a card

  instrutech corp has a nice looking  bit ad and da board that can run  at the speeds you want

the itc 

doesnt have dma but it does have  a good sized fifo that can buffer your samples

instrutech can be reached  at   or  fax

 i dont know about the instrutech boards though i plan to check them out but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and sn ratio of many of the  bit boards out there

the ni boards are very clearly specified in terms of monotonicity sn ratio accuracy etc and the nba and nba have all the dyynamic range and freedom from distortion that youd expect from a good true  bit converter

this is not true for the spectral innovations boards for example

i had to get   rid of my venerable bernoulli  last year with enough stuff deleted   might fix the problem  in my case the cartridges wouldnt   formatmountpartition for aux

  all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my  mac plus and my powerbook 

it was for this reason i assumed  the problem had something to do with the quadra

the problem occurred when i ejected  a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes  saying this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware  even though there was no cartridge in the drive

  mark the problem mentioned last is a known quadra scsi problem it was heavily discussed last year and an apple employee pointed out that there was a one byte error in the scsi driver routine for the quadras at least the  and 

system 

should not have that problem for most people the solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor

in my case mass microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my quadra  all that occured early last year

from lumpkincorvusnasnasagov forrest e lumpkin iii subject help  scsi woes on mac iifx keywords scsi iifx organization nasa ames research center lines  i am having trouble with scsi on a mac iifx

the machine is  years old and i have been using the same hard drive internal maxtor lxts for two and a half years

the disk recently crashed

i reformatted silverlining  but during the reformat i received random write errors during testing

the error message reported was like sector  write error detected after testing good  sector not mapped out

this occurred randomly all over the hard disk which makes me suspect the diagnostics reference to sector  



on the third reformat and after reinstalling the scsi readwrite loops i was able to get through passes  and  with no errors

pass  for some reason reported a lot of errors but still mapped out no sectors

i decided to go ahead and try to resinstall system  and reload my data from a backup

this proceded normally however i now have suboptimal performance

symptoms include o frequent crashes o instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to correct

o instances of not finding the disk on the scsi chain on reboot

if i boot from norton utl

after this occurs it cannot find the disk either

the only thing that fixes this is recycling the power

it sometimes requires several attempts

questions  has anyone had this type of problem before

is the problem with the fx motherboard and its nonstandard scsi implementation or with my maxtor disk

is there some diagnostic software that would help me make this determination

is it a termination problem

i currently have external syquest and an external dataframe xp on the chain

the xp is at the end and has internal termination so i am not using the iifx terminator

i do have the scsi filter installed on the internal drive

i have run with this exact steup for   years with one previous disk crash requiring a reformat about a year ago

i also have symptoms if i disconnect the external devices so i dont see how scsi termination would now be an issue

of course who knows  help would be much appreciated

all hp printers except iiisi are rated very low compared to other noname bargainpriced printers

why is that so

on the pc hp printers are the standard amongst printer manufacturers

ps my personnal favorite budgetwise would be the iiip

the iiip has just been superseded by the m which is the one i am using at work

the quality of the print is execellent beating  dpi printers hands down

in australia the price of the m is about comparable with that of the iiiseries so hp are trying to get people to buy the new one

 its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a vertical position

if the drive is formatted in a horizontal position it can not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position

im not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or  months from now but why take that chance

if you want more detailed info on the problem please i think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive on its side

the point is this will only be sure to work on the new drives namely  ht lps drives that have a smaller platter and are also more stable

why should i take the chance

because ive been running a maxtor  ht  lps on both its side and flat for about a year and ive had no problems with it

from dcbwdlwdlloralcom david c blume subject cannot move data fast enough

summary disk  buffer  network card keywords nubus scsi disk throughput organization gokuraku videos lines  i want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around  megabytes  sec for very large data transfers

around  mb

i have a quadra 

i have a nubus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 

mbs

using blockmode transfers i have a highspeed disk array no asynchronous pb calls that can achieve 

mbs

lets say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card

it is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer then transfer all the data from the buffer to card



mbs then 

mbs result in an overall 

mbs

too slow

so i tried the following scheme for an nmegabyte transfer step  load the st mb from disk to buffer

step  asynch send st mb out card load the nd mb from disk to buffer

step  asynch send nd mb out card load the rd mb from disk to buffer



step n asynch send the n mb out card load the nth mb from disk to buffer

step n send the nth mb out card

even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously and the card does not use the mac cpu at all it is using the buffer tho each of the steps  through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another

so there is no improvement in the rate

why

is the mac ram dualport

so the nubus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time

is the problem that the two devices card and disk driver both have to use the same bus to mac ram

is there anything i can do

 seanmcdacdalca writes  in article wgwcpdlynetcomcom wgwnetcomcom william g wright writes   anyway i was hoping someone knowledgeable  about mac internals could set me straight is it simply  impossible for a mac se to print grayscale or could  to use the grayscale features i believe you need a mac equipped with colour quickdraw

i was told this somewhere or other but its   i think you will find that the mac se can print grayscale images loaded  with the proper software

however the mac se cannot display grayscale on the original poster w g wright posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizzbang laser printer from apple a select  i think which can print grayscale

he then said that he cannot print grayscale from his se computer and also that all the experts he has dealt with agree that it is not possible

this is the one major bugbear about doing a rd party se upgrade compared to apples se to se upgrade you will never be able to run color quickdraw

it is color quickdraw that controls color and grayscale

ses can print some colour this is because quickdraw  the original noncolour version has the right hooks for eight colours

some of you will remember the scsigraph solution to getting a colour screen for your se i think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something

there is no reason that apple couldnt release software patches for older computers there are lots of mac pluses classics and ses that have been upgraded to  and  processors which should be perfectly able to deal with color quickdraw  but they wont and rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the macs roms ie

nutek et al just one caveat i would have thought that if you were printing a postscript grayscale image onto a postscript grayscale printer that you would be able to do so whatever mac you were using

and i am pretty sure that the select  is not a postscript printer

a k dram chip is a  kilobit chip whereas a k simm is a  kilobyte memory module

the simm is a pcb with a  pin connector edge and on the simm are   kilobit dram chips making the total memory  kbytes

you are correct assuming that simms will not fit into a laserwriter

insert usual disclaimer here  remove the top lid of the machine

you will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower

follow the usual antistatic precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do this

unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac

remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up

the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply

you may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply

leave that alone

the plastic tab from the tower is all you need release

look at the rear of the tower assembly

you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive

disconnect all these from the motherboard

the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it

unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount  look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower

a phillips head screw is at the base

remove it taking care not to drop it into the case

a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here

remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower

this tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly

slide the entire tower assembly  cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case

congratulations you have now gained access to your machines simm slots

the six big slots are for vram

one usually must install all six to gain useful video modes

all simms ram or vram installed with their chips facing the front of the motherboard

the four smaller sockets in front are for ram simms

install simms in sets of four into these sockets

be sure you seat the simms squarely and firmly into a fully upright position

reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about  cm posterior of its intended position

lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case

once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place

reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables

dontt forget the floppy drive cable

in article ckzlskkbdartvaxdartmouthedu hadescoosdartmouthedu brian v hughes writes  mmillergarnetmsencom marvin miller writes my friend recently purchased a lc iii and he wants to know if there is such a demon called nubus adapter for his pds slot

  the lc family of macs can only  use pds cards

they are not able to use nubus

 ah but why

can some technicallyhip macslinger tell us what the difference is between pds and nubus

 is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into pds and ends in a nubus card cage

at least marvins friend has not been able to locate one and neither have i

what is the fundamental reason for this

           bill higgins fermi national accelerator laboratory    bitnet higginsfnalbitnet    internet higginsfnalfnalgov   spanhepnet higgins second wave makes nubus card cages that work on the pds slots of at least three macs the se iisi and centris 

they have not to my knowledge announced such a device for the lcii but they could make one technologically

the pds card that goes to the cage simply needs the nubus controller circuitry present on nubus macs

why though does anyone care about this

dgr has a threepds adapter for the lclcii

they will soon have one for the lciii

pds is better than nubus for most people in most applications

granted there are more nubus cards

but most applications that require a nubus card like fullmotion video capture shouldnt be done on an lclciilciii anyway

iros serge prudhomme  prudhomiroumontrealca writes  any info on the video processor am that sit on it any way to  program that  chip

what companie makes that chip

   apple was never able to provide any docs or tools to program that chip

i  value it as  the least value per  piece of computer hardware i ever bought due to the  complete  lack support tools

there was a refund for usbuyers of this card but we  europeans  were left out in the rain once again

i agree completely but there was only a refund for people who bought the gc with a quadra

i have seen an alpha version of an extension from apple called 

gc quicktime video which offloads quicktime compressiondecompression from the cpu to the am on the card

so it seems it can be done even though in a developer article it states that the gc cant be programmed  but they asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway steve margelis melbourne university

does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c regarding fpu

in all mac price lists ive seen every c as the message fpu optional

i know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all c have the fpu built in except the  configuration

why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list

perhaps the reason is simplemaybe the marketing people who put together the brochures and price lists werent clear on the fpu issue

afterall apples literature is not always  correct

a funny one i noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the macs with cd capability refer to the auto inkjet feature

this should have read auto inject feature as it does on some other correct brochures ive seen from apple

since it was correct on some older brochures i can only guess that someone edited the copy saw inject and thought it was a typo and changed it to the more familiar word inkjet

hmmm what would that be

a printer built into the cd player

a way of writing information to a cd

 

 nazariopopcisyaleedu edgardo nazario writes the info i am about to give is not a rumour its the truth

the new macintosh coming in the second quarter will have a cpu of their own

excuse me but have not all macs got a cpu

alain alain get your facts straight before you post something like this

the duo dock does not have a cpu of its own

it is a docking station with ports connecting various components including the portable powerbook with its own cpu

i guess these rumored new duo docks have a builtin cpu to perform functions of their own

interesting

if theyre not compatible with the current duo models i think youll be hearing a lot more screwed by apple complaints

 i am a freshman in college and cant decide whether to major in computer  engineering or computer science

any advice or suggestions will be  appreciated

  thanks  mike a professor of mine once said the difference between a computer engineer and a computer scientist is about  meaning the engineer makes  more than the cs

seriously though the main difference is that most cs people write programs that people will use ie

database graphics word processors etc while an engineer writes for machines or control systems ie

the computer in your car a flight control system computer controled devices etc

in other words cs writes software while cse writes firmware

these are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is

not necessarily a thridparty adapter apple does manufacture transceivers for thinwire and baset twisted pair cable media as well as an aui attachment unit interface transciever

they run at  each

if you use thinwire or baset youll probably also need terminators apples transceivers are selfterminated if i remember correctly but i have no idea about decs

the thirdparty media adapters are usually cheaper at least in toronto than apples

i bought the adapters from asante instead of apple

gurmanumbragsfcnasagov joseph b gurman writes  the decstation  models  and  come with thinwire only cant say for certain about the models  and  so your best bet thats not true

only the decstation  comes with a thinwire bnc coaxial ethernet connector

the   and  all have a single pin aui ethernet connector only

i distinctly remembered this because when got the  first and i thought all of them are going to be thinwire

i eventually had to go back and ordered destas decs oversized version of an auitobnc adapter that must be used with a transciever cable for the rest of the stations

my advise to the very original poster beverly

is  if all you want is to create a lan with two workstations and wont add machines to it ever go for thinwire regardless of the media type

going for utp unshielded twisted pair wiring requires a concentrator which means extra money and i believe these units come with at least  ports

as for thicknet its a nightmare and cabling is expensive

avoid it unless you have no choice eg

the two machines are two floors parts

on the mac side you will need  one thinwire media adapter from apple or thirdparty

macx make sure you get version 

  wont run on system   mactcp which comes with macx if you get macx v you should be getting mactcp v with it

dont use earlier versions on a centris

you may or may not need a ohm terminator depending on the thinwire media adapter

so just ask the sales if the adapter is selfterminated or not

configure mactcp to use ethernet

on the decstation side you will need  for a model  you will only need a tconnector

for models     you will need an auitobnc adapter

get one that can be plugged in directly to the aui port of the decstation

this way you save the cost of a transciever cable a pin aui male to a pin aui female cable

get a ohm terminator

your twomachine network will look like this t           decstation centris   or t            decstation centris     ohm terminator t  t connector   thinwire rg coaxial cable   auitobnc ie

dhkubbpcuucp dave kitabjian writes  im sure intel and motorola are competing neckandneck for crunchpower but for a given clock speed how do we rank the following from st to th                how about some numbers here

some kind of benchmark

if you want let me start it  dx   specint  specfp 

while youre at it where will the following fit into the list    pentium  powerpc  fastest then pentium with the first versions of the powerpc somewhere in the vicinity

numbers

pentium mhz   specint  specfp 

powerpc mhz   specint  specfp 

note this is the  alpha mhz   specint specfp  just for comparison and about clock speed does doubling the clock speed double the overall processor speed

and fill in the s below     mhz     mhz no

computer speed is only partly dependent of processorclock speed

memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and io speed

as processor clock rates go up the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed

if you have a mhz processor it can be reading another word from memory every ns

sure you can put all ns memory in your computer but it will cost  times as much as the slower ns simms

not in a clockdoubled system

there isnt a doubling in performance but it is quite significant

maybe about a  increase in performance

besides for  wait state performance youd need a cache anyway

i mean who uses a processor that runs at the speed of ns simms

note that this memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 

mhz

and roughly the  is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the 

numbers

the ni boards are very clearly  specified in terms of monotonicity sn ratio accuracy etc and the  nba and nba have all the dyynamic range and freedom from  distortion that youd expect from a good true  bit converter

this is  not true for the spectral innovations boards for example

to boorishly reply to myself i found i did have the instrutech information already

the specs to use the term loosely are as follows ad  bit converter with  bit accuracy to  khz  bit accuracy to  khz

no specs for sn monotonicity linearity

there are  multiplexed inputs sharing the single ad so that all inputs are not samples at the same time and in the above conversion specs the allchannel sample rate must be used

thus for two channels you only have  unknown quality bits at  khz per channel

this is poorer quality than the national instruments at the same sample rate

da  bit converter

no specs for sn monotonicity linearity

each of the  output channels has its own converter

the price for the external converter box the itc the nubus interface board the mac plus c driver software and igor xops is 

rather steep

could be that the disk spins faster so data transfers faster

i have only one report which seems to indicate  that a k cache card gives you only about a  speedup

its small enough that i will attach it

i have also measured some real programs with and without the  kb cache

the speedup varies a lot from app to app ranging from  to 

i think an average of  is about right

the subjective difference is not great but is sometimes noticable

a simple cache card certainly does not transform a iisi into something enormously better

i do not have an fpu

the conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between k and k caches

i bought mine from third wave for well under 

i have had absolutely no problems at all with it

if you get complete speedometer runs for a k cache id like to see them

lets check the conventional wisdom

the so called performance rating numbers by themselves are of no interest

the parts that can blow the adb power fuse and rf filter arent too expensive so if you have a someone around who can do componentlevel repair it may be worth the risk especially if youre around seattle cause you might get to pay me to fix it  on the other hand if your only repair option is the applestandard logic board swap major  you should probably play it safe

  scsi yes adb yes floppies yes

they can all cause trouble

otoh some of us get lucky ive unplugged and replugged scsi and adb quite often and never blown anything

i blew out the adb by shorting the cable though

   i wonder why nobody has ever tried to replace the oscilator only like on a mac iisi

as i understand the newer variable speed overdrive is only hardware and alittle init which is use to adjust the speed

my idear is to replace the cristal oscilator wit  h a socket and than i can change the oscilator very easy

this will be alot cheaper the the newer variable speed overdrive

i would gues only  to  are need to do the upgrade

  does someone on the net ever tried this variant of speeding up the quadra 

in the may issue of ct magazine was an article about upgrading  models of apple

they simply change crystals and add a fan

hammerhead centris  was able to work with  mhz cooler prefered and for  dm you get an  mhz which works with the appropriate crystal at full speed

extra cooling required centris  like quadra  with extra cooling mhz works on most machines and for real power enthusiasts they used a quadra  at  mhz wow

but for better description you should get this issue of ct a german pc magazine

this past summer i upgraded increased the memory in a powerbook and a ci

when i called to place the order for the pb ram i was told by the sales person that they would give me a  rebate if i would return the original ram which was also techworks ram

i followed the instructions for returning the old ram expecting to see a credit on my visa within a few weeks

well months went by and no credit

after many calls almost none of which were ever returned  arghhh i finally found someone who told me why we never received your old chips

i then explained i the procedure that i had followed to return them to which the person replied you mean you sent them us mail

which i had per the original sales persons instructions

i was told that they their loss of us mail shipments is not uncommon come on and that i should have sent the stuff via fedex etc

i reasoned that i had done exactly what i had been told to but they would not budge the people i spoke with were absolutely no help

i sent letters copies of the original receipts attempted to trace the package through the us mail made many more phone calls to techworks all to no avail i wouldnt giveup because i was so disgusted

salessupport people supervisors there was nothing i could do to pursuade them to make it right

i finally in total disgust wrote a letter to my credit card company asking them to investigate the problem

three weeks later the credit miraculously appeared on my statement

i have not in recent memory been so disgusted with the service that i received from a company

in all fairness they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off but i went to such great lengths to prove to them that this really happened

a professor of mine once said the difference between a computer engineer and a computer scientist is about  meaning the engineer makes  more than ps

the  is not just a joke scott  for the most part this is a bunch of bunk

ive got a computer engineering degree yet ive spent the last  years writing software that people actually use

moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect i received  job offers upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were year lower

my advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them

 emt well here is my 

worth

advice from a grad student

i agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me

the important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and learn as much as possible about it

in my five years of education in this field though brief compare to alot of people i had to think about this kind of question a lot

did i make the right decision in going into electrical engineering as opposed to computer engineering or cs

the more i go thru school the more i believe that this kind of question is irrelevant

i have come to believe that choosing cs because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something

everything is interwoven and inseparable

cs ce and ee are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other

my advice is dont limit yourself but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to learn

that of course depends on the curriculum at your persective school

i would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible

beside i dont know why the school would make a student choose a major before herhis sophamore year

hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case you suffer a little more and go to grad school

about the money

dont look at the averages if you are good you are going to earn more money than anyone else

if you are a superstar programmer you will earn millions

like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers

also you can sample the cdaudio using the sound control panel by clicking on the options button next to the microphone icon

how do you click on the options button

ive never seen it undimmed

 the latest word on this is you have to disconnect the microphone cable on the motherboard

then the button is supposed to undim

for zterm i initially did the following atz atd atw then i set my init string to atz

thats it

rsmithpearltuftsedu rod smith writes i cant help you with firstclass or telefinder but ive been using zterm and a zyxel for close to two weeks now

heres what i did  once in zterm set hardware handshaking on and the bps rate to 

youve probably already done this

then i typed  atd atw  the first line sets the modem to ignore the dtr line necessary for hardware handshaking with most though not all mac hardware handshaking cables

the second stores this setting in nonvolatile memory in the modem so its the default when the modem starts

in the modem preferences dialog i have the modem initialization string set to atzm which just insures that the stored setting is used useful if starting zterm after using something like the fax software or macwoof which change the settings in other ways

alternatively you could leave the factory default the way it is and just set the zterm initialization string to atdm which would accomplish the same thing if the modem is always on before you start zterm and if other programs dont modify the settings

or atzdm would work even if other programs modify the modems settings

i do it the way i do because i sometimes forget to turn on the modem before launching zterm and this way im assured of having the correct dtr handling when the modems powered up

after comparing the above strings with my at commands reference guide i came up with atzlnxdsm this is entered in the initialize box on the modem preferences in zterm

quick summary of each commmand z  reset modem to user profile 

l  speaker volume at  fairly quiet n  ring volume at  fairly quiet x  display connect info according to setting  see manual d  assume dtr computer is always on s  dial speed at  as fast as zyxel can handle in firstclass i used this same string with the addition of s right before the s command in the setup box

this disables the autoanswer function of the modem for firstclass

i based my modem setting on the supra fax and just changed the above mentioned string

in telefinder i based my setting on the zoom v  hh setting

i changed the modem initialization string to the same one i used for firstclass and everything seems to work fine

sorry it took so long to get this summary out

if someone wants to forward this to the infomacreports directory at sumexaim it might save other newbie zyxel users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings and also save the net some redundant messages

as i said i know a multisession cdrom is necessary if you do more photos but what if it is just a writable cdrom drive and do a second session do you need one for that too

if you write a second time to a cd you need to have multisession capability to read the second session

whether it is photos or just data or whatever

here is a simplified way of looking at it the first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks

the second session has a newer directory structure but the first directory still exists because you cannot change only add

so if you put that in a normal drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data

multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc older systems look only for the directory not taking multiple directories into account

although nicad c batteries should be completely   discharged about once a month leadacid batteries  shouldnt ever be   completely discharged well maybe once in a while is okay

   this is a very common misconception dealing with nicad batteries

it is  a good idea to completely discharge a nicad cell periodically

it is  not a good idea to completely discharge a nicad battery

the difference  being that a cell is only one cell nicad puts out 

volts like a  rechargeable aaa aa c or d a battery is defined as more than one  cell  volt or 

for nicad equivalent

due to differences in the  individual cells of a battery complete discharge can actually harm  a nicad battery more than help it overcome the memory effect

the  most common problem is that over time an individual cell can develop  internal shorts which will weaken other cells that are connected to  it thus reducing the lifespan of your battery pack

ku ku kin hung au hello mr

au i have to disagree regarding your assessment of macintosh in hong kong

the mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market as in the us a local magazine next magazine similar to newsweek here uses the mac extensively

i have seen sir speedy and other franchises in hong kong equipped with macbased systems

true the discount is not as steep as here because customers in hong kong cannot buy from gray market nor are mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like apple does here with the performa lin e at this point the sale of mac is handled by one exclusive distributor

on the other hand you can always get a pc clone or in the earlier days illegal clones of the apple iie

your perception of the mac not being too popular in hong kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell pc clones with probably illegal copies of bios than to pay for a mac

similarly you cannot say lotus  surely is not well accepted in hong kong because the sale is so low

may be it is because of all those places in kowloon where illegal copies of lotus  can be bought for  and  for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals

there is no danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging adb devices with the power on

the problem is that the pins in the adb connector are close to each other and if you happen to bend the cable a little while inserting it you short the adb port

if you take it to an apple repair centre that means a new motherboard though a component replace is physically possible same goes for serial ports localtalk as well cheers  h   jon wtte hnadakthse mac hacker deluxe  this article printed on  recycled electrons

 im going to buy a daystar  with  mhz for the se

since there  were so many mails about problems with this board my questions  does the board work with 

and aux 



does anybody know problems  with any kind of software 

  well i havent seen any reports of problems with the turbo   but to my knowledge daystar has not released a version of the  board that works with anything but the iisi and iici and they  have not finished tweakingtesting for use with aux

this may  not happen until the aux  upgrade is released my guess so  id recommend waiting or buying the  mhz  board and upgrade  later when aux compatibility is assured

turbo  interface  cards for the ii iix se iicx etc will probably be available  sooner but if aux compatibility is a requirement it is probably  best to be patient and let someone else be the pioneer

 an added advantate of waiting for the daystar for the se is that just as with the  power cache the  accelerator will plug into the cpu socket leaving the pds slot free for a video card or ethernet card

with daystars upgrade path its a no lose situation

not quite

mhz pentium   specint  specfp 

 mhz mc   specint  specfp 

but the interesting comparision is how fast clockcycle chips you can get  an alpha is way slow at  mhz but blazes at  mhz

  as far as the dx goes   specint  specfp 

but the  is or will soon be available in  mhz version making it comparable to a dx intel chips have traditionally been faster than their motorola equivalents although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance is something that is highly debatable

i think you have that one turned around they have faster clock cycles but less power behind each cycle

not to mention that the intel instruction stream is byteoriented longest intel instruction is  bytes what an odd number  which makes it hard to do any intelligent memory subsystem

definitely needed the heatsink

the cpu was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until i glued on a  cent radio shack sink

i made a call for reports of failures last week

no reports have arrived here

locally in seattle there is a reported cpu damage due to the user slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board  not exactly a problem due to the cpu running too fast

i think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system configurations including pds and nubus cards which were used

id be happy to coordinate and report results guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu

addressing modes

commands that do fills should be slightly faster since the new instructions fetch  bytes at a time versus one

even the  can fetch two bytes at a time

the new instruction in the  is move which fetches  bytes at a time instead of  which the  has that means  bit pixels instead of one

in article cnqcllpnewscsouiucedu rvenkateuxcsouiucedu ravikuma venkateswar writes  stuff deleted  besides for  wait state performance youd need a cache anyway

i mean who uses a processor that runs at the speed of ns simms

note that this memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 

mhz

 more stuff deleted how do you calculate that figure

id assume even in personal computers the board designers would use bank switching to optimistically quadruple the access speed or am i missing something here

the previous article referred to the fact that you could only use ns simms in a mhz machine but that you could use ns simms in slower machines

i just pointed out that if you could only use ns simms in a mhz machine you cant use ns simms in anything faster than a 

mhz machine

bank switching and caches were not considered in either example although both would help memory access

hsk  ravikumar venkateswar rvenkateuiucedu a pun is a no blessed form of whit

 another thing why a scsi interface 

because scsi works well with removable media and works well with large capacity devices

the floppy interface you suggest handles the former but it doesnt have any hooks for dealing with the latter youd have to kludge it

plus its extremely low performance

and scsi has gobs of room for expansion compared with a floppy i can just see it lets stick a  a  a tape drive and a mo drive all on the floppy interface

the possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous

whether this is your problem or not i dont know

i have had sporadic scsi problems with my iifx since i bought it

first thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system

if you continue to get errors it is probably the drive

if it formats fine then i would try to format it on your system with no externals

if this fails then the scsi controller on your iifx needs repairreplacement

   the lc family of macs can only   use pds cards

they are not able to use nubus

  ah but why

can some technicallyhip macslinger tell us what the  difference is between pds and nubus

  is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into pds and ends in a  nubus card cage

at least marvins friend has not been able to  locate one and neither have i

what is the fundamental reason for  this

 i think that there do exist nubus expansion cages im sure ive seen them advertised occassionally but i think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a lc and iivx so unless you need lots of nubus slots its not worth the bother

 of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive  nubus technology isnt a special apple proprietry thing i have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from texas instruments

so there is no problem building an expansion box

apple uses the ieee nubus standard for their  bit backplane bus

ijust got a new datadesk e keyboard to go with my new centris  and have a problem doing desktop rebuilds

i hold down the command and option keys and restart but nothing happens

the dip switches are set the right way and the command and option keys seem to work on anything else

im running 

btw

anyone know what the problem is

terry terry hi

i recently bought an lciii and a datadesk e i cant remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it however it did give me a strange problem

when i held down shift during startup to disable all extensions nothing happened

i tried it with another keyboard using the same adb connector cable and it worked with the other keyboard

the shift key on the datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise

i checked the dipswitches and they are fine

try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works

i am annoyed with datadesk

i sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspectionrepairreplacement

the technician on the phone said they have a  day turn around time meaning you should receive the inspectedrepaired keyboard in that time

well they have had the keyboard for over  weeks and i still have gotten very little info from them about it

its annoying because it cost me  to send them the keyboard they do not refund the money and their costumer service lines are toll calls

tell me if you have a similar experience

from melshearmaccomwuucp subject adapter cable for vga monitors lines  does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to apples specs that forces the external output on lcs and the powerbooks  and duo  into a true vga style output signal

the nec adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the macs output into vga mode

do i have to make one of these or does someone already have one madeup

the following is the apple spec for the lc cpu vga cable adapter

im assuming that the powerbooksduos will work with the same adapter

 macintosh lc to vga the macintosh lc can supply a  x  vga timed signal for use with vga monitors by using an adapter cable

the standard macintosh lc supports vga to  colors and with the optional k vram simm the vga monitor is supported to  colors

note the macintosh lc supplies signals capable of driving ttl level inputs

however some low impedance input vga monitors do not work with the macintosh lc

to connect a macintosh lc to a vga monitor you need to make an adapter cable from the macintosh lc video connector to the vga monitor

following is the pinout description for the adapter cable macintosh lc vga video connector pin signal name      red ground   red video signal   green video signal   green ground   blue video signal   blue ground   hsync   vsync   hsync ground  nc sense  sense tied together vga monitors are identified by shorting pin  to pin  on the macintosh lc video connector

the macintosh lc grounds pin  on its video connector which results in pulling down pin  and gives the correct monitor id for a vga monitor

 pionapr organization rutgers univ new brunswick nj lines  well i just got my centris  yesterday

it took just over two weeks from placing the order

the dealer rutgers computer store appologized because apple made a substitution on my order

i ordered the one without ethernet but they substituted one with ethernet

he wanted to know if that would be alright with me

they must be backlogged on centri wout ethernet so theyre just shipping them with

anyway im very happy with the  with a few exceptions

being nosy i decided to open it up before powering it on for the first time

the scsi cable to the hard drive was only partially connected must have come loose in shipping

no big deal but i would have been pissed if i tried to boot it and it wouldnt come up

the hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine

ive heard apple will exchange it if you complain so i might try to get it swapped

i am also dissappionted by the lack of soft poweronoff

this wasnt mentioned in any of the literature i saw

also the location of the resetinterupt buttons is awful

having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient

oh and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on powerup

ive seen this mentioned by others so it must be afeature

anyway above all its fast

 im in the market for a postscript compatible laser writer

my needs  are pretty modest so  dpi  pages a minute would be just fine

 my budget is also pretty modest so inexpensive would also be good

 it will be working from a single mac but networkability would  probably be a good investment for the future

 with that in mind    anyone have comments about the suitabilityqualityvalue of a gcc  blp elite printer

i just recently purchased the gcc blp elite and i really like it

my needs are much the same as what you describe

in addition i wanted to get one that i could access via appletalk so that eliminated the new line of inexpensive printers from apple

the print quality is good to excellent based on what font youre using and what paper you use

im still experimenting with different papers but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work fine

printing envelopes transpariencies letter head or other single feed jobs is very easy

there is an adjustable automatic centering guide on top of the sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly and doesnt feed a sheet from the sheet feeder as some do

i have no affiliation with gcc just a satisfied customer

 hi there  does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c regarding fpu

in all mac price lists ive seen every c has the message fpu optional

i know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all c have the fpu built in except the  configuration

why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list

im planning to buy the c cd pretty soon but im now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not

why say optional if its built in

please anybody help me understand this game

 regards  thian

 if you get the centris  with cd configuration you are getting a mac with a rc processor that has builtin math coprocessor support

my understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the centris   without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu

apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonfpu system to become an fpu system

and it is unclear whether the  processor on the nonfpu system a lc can be replaced with a rc supplied by another vendor

apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris  which only comes with a nonfpu lc processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu  the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again according to apples memo

hope that helps

hard disk drive to iicx keywords mac iicx internal hard disk drive scsi replyto rogntorbidtunitno torbjrn rognes organization div

of cs  telematics norwegian institute of technology lines  i havent seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac

we would like to try it and i wonder if someone had some good advice

we have a mac iicx with the original internal quantum mb hard disk and an unusable floppy drive

we also have a new spare connor mb disk which we would like to use

the idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk but there seems to be some problems the internal scsi cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive

if i made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each  for motherboard  for each of the  disks would it work

is the iicx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk

what about terminators

i suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard but leave them installed in the other disk

the scsi id jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets id 

the old one should have id 

it is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive as we have an external floppy that we can use if it wont boot of the hard disk

thank you

 in article aprvaxoxfordacuk roesvaxoxfordacuk  wrote     i am working a data acquisition and analysis program to collect data   from insect sensory organs

    stuff deleted     another alternative is the use of the sound input port

 can you really make due with the nonexistent dynamic range of an bit  converter of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity and perhaps  accoupled as well

it clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many cases it will do fine

the critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency maximum about  action potentials per seconds and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape

so the resolution of about 

 you get with an  bit convertor is more then sufficient

ac coupling does not have to be a problem either since in many cases you are not interested in the dc level

my pre amplifier is ac coupled also

the critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass

if the cutoff point is to high the action potentials will be slightly distorted

but even that normally does not matter since it is the occurrence of the spike that is important

however i do want to know what exactly i can expect before i start battling with the toolbox to get it going

as yet i have no clue were to start looking for the technical specifications

from fehgumiamiirmiamiedu subject disappointed by la cie organization univ of miami ir lines  approximately four months ago i purchased a quantum lps hd from la cie for 

after two months the drive started having problems

first there were intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then silverlining 

wouldnt even recognize the drive

so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one

well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems

often when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark

sometimes if i then insert the silverlining 

program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives

at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd

ive called la cie again and theyve given me another rma

their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesnt see the drive theres a definite hardware problem

given that this is the second bad drive in four months i asked la cie to send me a new one but they said no

also within three weeks after i purchased my original drive la cie dropped the price on it by over 

i can accept that a drive or two may be bad

and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs

and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations

nevertheless taken together the convergence of these factsevents have left a bad taste in my mouth

i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will sendi think the data is still in good shape and ill have to again reinstall everything from floppiesthey said it would cost me  for data recovery

it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a day warranty should be new

i feel a little helpless about all this

i dont mean to necessarily flame la cietheir support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful

but cmon

sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way

i sent a letter to la cies customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price

i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product

they didnt even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other

whats the moral of this story

im not sure

but i do know i wont buy any other products from la cie in the future

bill krauthammer fehgumiamiirmiamiedu ps please dont email or post about how good your la cie product and service has been

im not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that

all im saying is that ive had a disappointing experience with them and ill be taking my business elsewhere in the future

why would apple release a duo dock with a processor of its own

heres why people have hounded apple for a notebook with a  processor in it

apple cant deliver that right now because the  saps too much power radiates far too much heat and is too large for a notebook

how does one get around that without designing a new chipset

use existing powerbook technology to your best advantage

the duo dock gives apple a unique ability to give users that  power in a semiportable fashion

by plunking the  into the dock youve got quadra power at your desk

on the road that mhz  should be able to handle most of your needs

okay not the best solution but its an answer to a nowin situation

 so does this mean one will be able to use the powerbooks processor in parallel to the docks processor

okay were getting really hypothetical now

it would also be great for another reason  when not docked it could serve as an ara server to the large internal hd your corporate email etc

in a pinch you would also have two machines instead of 

if they could couple that thought with rocketshare and let you use both the  on the pb and the  on the dock it would be a mighty powerful dock

  all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my  mac plus and my powerbook 

it was for this reason i assumed  the problem had something to do with the quadra

even with the  quadra they mostly worked ok

the problem occurred when i ejected  a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes  saying this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware  even though there was no cartridge in the drive

  mark i have been using the pli sony 

mo drive and now a sharp color scanner using standard scsi cables and standard  terminator on my q

no problems

if you were using a iifx that might be another story

make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end

some boxes have internal terminators some can be switched out and others are socketted

these count

if the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling they have to be disabled ie switched out or pulled out of their sockets

if you have  boxes with internal terminations the terminations in one box has to be disabled etc

i am sure that this has been covered by the experts

my experience with scsi boxes that connect to the mac indicates that they must have some software package for the mac to talk to them

my pli mo drive and sharp scanner has one for each

good luck

is there a quality difference

officially no

from experience yours now included yes

quantums seem to be the most problemfree brand on the mac

second about hard drive position

ive put the lciii on its side and the new  hd has had no problems at all

ive even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems

as far as im concerned i dont believe hd position is important for drives up to  meg in any computer

i can tolerate about  ppm but anything slower than that and im not going to consider the price savings worth it

id be curious to hear peoples experience with it tho

i also infinitely prefer laser over ink i used to use hp deskjets in my last job and wasnt impressed with the quality

im a laser bigot and the first to admit it

 ill be using the printer to layout pages of a book im writing

the page will include multiple fonts ps graphics scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures not sure yet

the quality doesnt need to be spectacular but it needs to be clear and readable

true

personal laserwriter ls and ntr

i have access to the apple employee discount i work for one of apples spinoffs so i can get these reasonably cheaply

ive heard bad things about the ls comments

im leaning towards the personal ntr cause it has a nice small footprint

i heard mumbles once about a postscript upgrade



used hp laserjets

all of the vendors i have called say that the internal video will not work on a true vga monitor but will work on a ibm compatible multisync like the sonys or the nec monitors

i thought the vga capability of lciii was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive vga monitors

am i confused or are these vendors just not up to speed

has anyone used an lciii with a non multisync vga monitor and if so where did you get your adapter please be specific w vendor and cat 

i would prefer to get a apple monitor for these lciiis its unseemly to see the finder inside an ibm bezel but the more money we save on monitors the more lciiis we can afford and the more pss we can get rid of

 its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  vertical position

if the drive is formatted in a horizontal position it can  not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position

 im not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or  months from now but  why take that chance

if you want more detailed info on the problem please  mail me at sunnytdnabchsuhedu 

 sunny i asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my  on its side

i received a response from someone at seagate sorry i trashed the message stating that most newer drives seagates at the least can very well compensate for gravity

this means that a horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data integrity problems

the only way that newer drives cannot work is if you have varying forces shaking bouncing etc so dont place the drive on its side on a rocking chair 

what constitutes a newer drive i dont know try calling your drive manufacturer

i have a quantum lps internal and since i got it a month ago i am guessing its newer

hi what alternatives to the express modem do duo owners have if they want to go at least  baud

every place in town says they are back ordered and part of the reason i want a laptop mac is so i can use it as a remote terminal from wherever i am but i really would hate to have to wait  months to get a modem in or have to settle with  baud

youre not going to like this but if memory serves me postings ive read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are no repeat no internal modems for the duo besides the express modem at any speed

something having to do with the modem using the main cpu for some of its tasks and apple not releasing details on the architecture or something

im vague on the details but the gist was that there are going to be no thirdparty internal duo modems

contentlength  lines  i have an se with a  meg hd which dates back to april 

when i originally purchased it i experienced the failure to boot problem

this was fixed soon after by a rom upgrade on the hard drive

lately a similar problem has been occuring

when the computer is powered on the hd light flashes a few times and then i am given the no disk to boot from icon

however upon turing the computer off and on again the drive always boots up just fine

furthermore if instead of turning the power on and off i press the reboot button the same problem occurs

but as i said turning the power off and on always works

this problem is different from the  boot problem in that before it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot

does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how it can be fixed

im wondering if its getting old and requires more time to come up to speed now

is there a pram or scsi setting that allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before trying to access the hd

 i cannot speak for dale

but i am quite sure that the macintosh uses the full bit or bit data path to its full advantage

that is it is running as fast with two or four pin simms as it would with one pin simm

now it may be that longword accesses assuming a bit data path here get the first byte from the first simm the second byte from the second and so on

this would mean that each longword of memory is actually split among four simms one for each byte

on the other hand it could be that the simms are interleaved by word or longword not just by byte or they could be successive in memory and the memory controller deals with the eightbit data path that each one has

i suspect though that they are interleaved to some extent so that  bits can be read or written at once

this would indicate a bytelevel interleave

 i am not confusing this with the new machines longword interleave with two pin simms of the same sort although that seems to be the same sort of idea

there you get an essential bit data path ro excuse me to ram instead of just a bit one

yes the cpu cant handle it but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something up

 so dale am i right

pin simms are interleaved by bytes allowing the full data bus

or as is common with usenet and me in particular am i as clueless as everyone else

what conclusion can be drawn from this

im trying to figure out what kind of memory configuration for the lc iii bit datapath would be fastest

any ideas

 i am looking for any information about the sigma designs  double up board

all i can figure out is that it is a  hardware compression board that works with autodoubler but  i am not sure about this

also how much would one cost

ive had the board for over a year and it does work with diskdoubler but not with autodoubler due to a licensing problem with stac technologies the owners of the boards compression technology

im writing this from memory ive lost the reference

please correct me if im wrong

using the board ive had problems with file icons being lost but its hard to say whether its the boards fault or something else however if i decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board the icon usually reappears

because of the above mentioned licensing problem the freeware expansion utility dd expand will not decompress a boardcompressed file unless you have the board installed

since stac has its own product now it seems unlikely that the holes in autodoublerdiskdoubler related to the board will be fixed

which is sad and makes me very reluctant to buy stacs product since theyre being so stinky

but hey thats competition

the internal scsi cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto which i added an extra connector about midway

the final hd was internally terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final hd had its terminator resistor packs removed

from walsteynfysruunl fred walsteijn subject builtin video problems on mac iisi 

organization physics department university of utrecht the netherlands lines  dear macfriends ive seen the following problem om three mac iisi machines all with  mb ram installed  or  ns simms

if the contents of a window are being calculated and updated a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated on the screen

the lines translate to the top of the screen and have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings they are a few millimeters apart

i admit that they are vague but they can still be distinguished clearly especially if the environment ie

the rest of the room is a bit dark

applications which produce this effect are  the previewer of directtex 

ie

dvireader 

kaleidagraph fpu the machines use their builtin video and drive the old apple hires monochrome screen two monitorscable sets tried

the effect is independent of the settings in the following control panels memory adressing mode disk cache and monitors nr of greyscolors

have you ever seen this effect too 

is there a solution

from guykuocarsonuwashingtonedu guy kuo subject re iisi clock upgrades organization university of washington lines  nntppostinghost carsonuwashingtonedu i have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the  mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillators outputs through a double throw switch to allow different speeds

there was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the si uses timing loops anything like a quadra for accessing its floppy drive dynamic switching will wreak havoc

a quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive

can someone please help me understand the current situation regarding simms

sure

i can give is a shot i have a iisi which i will probably keep for another  years

i would like to add more memory ie go from  mb to  mb

i know that i will need  x mb ns or faster simms

which simms  pin or  pin

you need to get the pin simms

would the simms i get today be usable in  years with a newer more powerful system

if you mean in a newer more powerful mac system then the answer is no

apple has stated that all new macs will use the pin simms and no longer use the pin simms

from tpdyakcom tom dickens subject re iisi clock upgrades organization boeing computer services lines  i too have been watching the iisi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few weeks

the plan i have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch

this way i can get the speed when i want but i can also run at slower stock speeds it i experience any compatability problems with any applications

i dont expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running but if i can switch without any lockup problems then i could switch to mhz when needed and put it back to idle  mhz when not needeed

this would further reduce the wearandtear on the cpu even with a heat sink

of course i would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board

i havent started probing around inside my si yet

does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators

thanks

i have a question regarding quadras vram

i have tried to find info on this but i could not get precise answers

on one hand we have a quadra  with a  monitor which is capable of bit color

how much vram does it have

to display millions of colors on a  monitor you need mb of vram in the q

on the other hand we have a quadra  with a  monitor which is capable of bit color only so it must have  ko of vram

correct

this is the amount of onboard vram that the q comes with

i would like to take vram simms for the  and put them in the  so that both machines have bit color capability

is it possible and if yes how many vram simms should i take from the 

yes this is possible

technically you only need to take out  of the vram simms but leaving in the other two will not get you anything because the  cannot really do anything with mb of vram

it only knows mb and mb

from the documentation i have the quadra  must get  mo vram to have bit color is that correct

yes this is correct

you get to mb by putting  k vram simms into the vram simm slots on the qs motherboard

bonus question where do vram simms hide

from the  documentation they seem to be behind the power supply

do i really have to take off the power supply to access the vram simms

yup

you have to take off the power supply

its only a couple of screws so you should be ok just make sure that everything is disconnected from it and watch out for static discharges

from durtralpuxisuedu ralph durtschi subject re iisi clock upgrade organization idaho state university pocatello lines  hi i have been getting a lot of requests for this information so i thought i would post it for those interested parties

sorry for length

to increase the maciisi speed to mhz or mhz the clock must be changed from mhz to mhz or mhz respectively

this is done by going to a staticfree work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on



open up the si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case



remove the hard disk by disconnecting the power and scsi cables spreading the tabs and lifting the drive out



remove the flopy drive



remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting the supply straight up and out



remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back bottom side of the fan and lifting straight up and out



remove the mother board by spreading the tabs on the left and right side of the board and sliding the board forward then lifting the board out

all connectors on the back of the board must be removed first 

desolder the mhz clock the one closest to the memory modules

this is not easy even for a skilled solderer



get an ic socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers



put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder them in

insert a mhz or mhz clock

put large power transistor heat sinks on the processor chip and the other large chip just to the right of the processor and figure some way to hold the heat syncs in place

i made a simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole in the board between the two chips

mount the screw using insulated washers

screw a cross member down over the heat syncs to hold them in place

dont use too much pressure



put it all back together and goforit

  i want a doublespin cdrom drive by may     looking into nec and apple doublespins only   what is the best

  nec toshiba and sony apple nearly deliver the same speed

 as apples prices are very low compared to there ram simms  you should buy what is inexpencive

but think of driver revisions

 it is easier to get driver kits from apple than from every other  manufacturer   christian bauer   bauerinformatikuniulmde    i thought nec and toshiba cdrom mechanism have an average access time of less than  ms

while the sonyapple cdrom drive has an access time of  ms for the doublespin models

  chung yang  i have the a cdtechnology drive with the toshiba mechanism and it is supposedly the fast and best now

it has an access of ms and a data transfer rate kbsec

it is multisession photocd compatible

it is available from educorp for  the cdtechnology one and comes with two mail in coupons for two free cds

im not sure if the cds are good since ive only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cds shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland

the cdtechnology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive which supposedly gives it a longer life and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust

a toshiba brand drive is also available but i think the cdtechnology is better since you get the same mechanism and at a slightly lower price with two free cds

the apple i drive sony mechanism is around a ms access time i think and a data transfer rate of kbsec

i know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here

it is not widely available except through the apple catalog which is bad at a price of only 

it is also multisession photo cd compatible

i think the external model comes with  free cds some of which are pretty good

the nec drive has been out the longest

it has an access time of ms and a data transfer rate of kbsec

it is available from many vendors around  dollars including educorp

it wasnt multisesssion photocd compatible before but i hear that the current version that is shipping is

owners of the older drives can get an upgrade

it does not come with any free cds unless you buy it in a bundle

of the three cdrom drives above i think the best choices would be the apple drive and the cdtechnologytoshiba drive

the apple drive for its compatibility with apple products and the cdtechnologytoshiba for its speed and performance

btw the models of the drives are apple applecd  or applecd i internal cdtechnology cdt the toshiba brand name model im not sure but it is also something like with  nec cdr im very happy with my drive

and have had no compatibility problems whatsoever

if i am wrong about any of the above do correct me but i am pretty sure of myself even when i think im not

also some of you out there might notice that i have the same last name as the president of cdtechnology which happens to be in southern california my hometown

however i am not a relative nor do i know the guy

zyxel has the biggest cult following and can be had for under  but i ignored it because i need something with mac software which will work without any tweaking

the att dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability

they are backordered at the moment probably because of the special  price in effect until may

its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems

warning att ads say that the modem comes with a mac kit cables  all and has lifetime warranty

this applies only when you order directly from paradyne

i called elektek one of the distributors and they wanted to charge me  for cable and gave only  year warranty usr sportster for the mac is also highly but not as highly recommended its only  from clubmac and if you are willing to roll your own cable and dont care about the faxstf software you can get the generic model from pc outlets for

so far no responsed that  ive noticed

please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade  paths cost efficiency proscons etc

  complete q are best obtained from your dealer or some recent  copy of macworld or macuser

 ethertalk card onboard  audio inout   mb ram on motherboard   simm slots   nubus slots

 more flexible buildin video than the ci

uses vram

  in comparison a iici with an accelerator wont give you  audio or ethernet or the same video options

 with a  accelerator cpu performance can be comparable but i  think it ends up costing more

  greg dudek actually an accelerator such as the daystar  mhz  is cheaper than upgrading to a q  mhz

the accelerator costs about  whereas the upgrade costs  just quoted from my dealer

however the q upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to  with  bit depth and up to  at  bit depth with additional vram

it also has a scsi port capable of a much faster throughput than the ci which makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive

if the improved video and scsi features are important to you youre better off getting the q upgrade otherwise save some money and get an accelerator

model  with  mb hd k vram no cards monitor apple  when the computer is set for  colors and certain operations are done particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open windows

these lines accummulate as the operation is continued

if a window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away the line disappear from that area of the screen

this problem is not observed if the monitor is configured for  colors or a  inch apple monitor with  colors is used

i suspect a bad video ram chip but cannot be certain

the problem has been apparent since day  but has gotten worse

we were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this and if so how to fix it

please also respond to azelenetbigmacmskccorg

thank you for your help

were all set to buy one of these for the office to use for scanning in color photographs and for optical character recognition

weve played with the original grayscale onescanner and were very pleased

is the color model comparable in quality

 also what brand of ocr software would you recommend

were leaning toward caere omnipage

any better ideas

thanks

i work in a campus bookstore and we had the opportunity to demo the color one scanner

i found it to be very impressive as well as affordable with the educational discount of course

from hurhfnalfnalgov patrick hurh subject cache card and optimum memory settings

organization fnal lines  distribution world nntppostinghost phurhfnalgov heres a question that may be simple enough to answer but has stumped myself and a few others what does an external ram cache card do for you if you already have a large cache set through control panel in your simms

ex i have a mac iici with  meg ram an external video card so i dont rob my simms and the default apple cache card i believe this is k

say i have my cache set at  meg what good does a measly k do me on the cache card

could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the simms

or does it still speed things up by providing a secondary staging area for data normally passed directly into the simm ram cache

im confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself

yet daystar fastcache has numbers which show around a  performance boost on some operations

are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most simm accesses

please help im trying to find the optimum memory settings for the iici system described in the ex above

what are the advantages of buying a global village teleport gold over other cheaper brands like supra zoom etc



i heard that both supra and zoom use the same software

why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems of supra

what kind of incompatibility is it



if i decided to buy the teleport gold is there any possibility to add a voice option in the near future



has anyone heard of a possible voice option that supra will offer this coming summer



a person did mention a new att modem

is it getting good reviews from various mac magazines



if i want the best fastest most economically sound and possible voice option what fax modem should i buy

  about hard drive companies the original  meg drive that was bad bad  sector or something was an ibm

the new one is a quantum

is there a quality difference

 apparently

   second about hard drive position

ive put the lciii on its side and  the new  hd has had no problems at all

ive even switched back and  forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems

as far  as im concerned i dont believe hd position is important for drives up  to  meg in any computer

dont know about cdrom though

   just like everything else in life the right lane ends in half a mile

  ravi konchigeri

 mongooselelandstanfordedu ravi its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a vertical position

if the drive is formatted in a horizontal position it can not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position

im not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or  months from now but why take that chance

if you want more detailed info on the problem please mail me at sunnytdnabchsuhedu

i am going to be getting a c soon but i dont want apple to come out with the cyclones and the tempest in a month and have the price drop on the system i want

i have negotiated a good deal with a supplier for a c  and i would like to jump on it but again i dont want the price drop to smuther me

btw the deal i have is a c  with mouse for  does anyone know of a better deal

i dont know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the price of the c is going to drop this year

this weeks macweek reports that apple is probably planning a drop in august

my guess is that it may come sooner if apple decides to change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer

your price looks pretty good at about  more then i payed for mine last month

i would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer like the cyclone but the resale value of my iici would have not been squat by then

thus financing forced me to purchase now

im happy with the machine and wont feel betrayed at all when apple cuts the price to less then  next week heh

bottome line if the c does what you want buy it

if you wait until the cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the powerpcs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them

you may save some money but youve lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer

face it apples prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux

at least they arent going to try raising them again grin

we have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the system and lets crash the mac then

okay we dont use the card quite like one should because we simulate errors in the 

before every instruction some specified registers are masked eg

to simulate a stuckaterror in certain bits

normally the crash instance of arose notices a crash sets a flag and stops working

by reading the mentioned flag the mac can notice a card crash

that works fine for almost all crashes but as said sometimes the card doesnt set the flag and disappears from the system

the documentation of arose does not tell us anything about its behavior when crashing and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing the assembler code and thats both frustrating and lengthy

so can anyone help

 first this is not an april  joke

  a dealer in my town told me that the powerbook dont sell as they use to sell

 the guy told me that apple is having the same problem it has when the desktop  mac was too expensive  the powerbook are too expensive in comparison to what  you can get on the dos side

what do you think of this

do you feel the same  thing about it

just curious

sounds about right

if there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to aggresively cut prices

once the demand fall off a bit then is the time to start getting aggressive with pricing

waiting too long can really hurt your business though  the powerbooks have sold very well up to now if they are slowing down apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions the only reason i own a powerbook is that i could spring for a  pb the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me

id bet theyll be coming out with more power versions too

i also returned pb memory last summer for credit and the sales person warned me not to use us mail

i did although i did insure the shipment and apparently techworks got it

theres nothing but the original system software on the machine

the battery has plenty of life  i think this must be a power manager problem but i dont know what to do about it

also the speaker occasionally makes a highpitched hiss

the noise is irregular but seems to favor sleep and restart commands

ive had my duo  for a few weeks now and suffer from both of the above problems

i reinstalled my system software twice in an effort to combat the problems  thinking they were system software problems

initially reinstalling the system seemed to help but not anymore

occasionally when i try to wake up the duo i get a solid screen of horizontal lines on the screen  it freezes

i also get the highpitched hiss occasionally  but only at startup

ive called the apple hotline  sosappl three times already and finally they agreed something is astray after my duos screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by itselft and put itself to sleep

this problem only occured twice

apple sent me a box to ship my duo to be looked at in new york but the problem now is intermittent and i cant afford to be without my duo at this time

buy it

 if you have no friends buy a  mb optical and stop i bought a bernoulli pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of diffrent storage solutions optical drives are slow very slow compared to  to ms access of bernoulli

since i needed additinol online storage rather than just a backup or archiev e disk i choosed bernoulli drive

i use adobe preimere and quicktime movies alot

you ran out of storage real fast

i ordered the coprocessor option but im really not sure that we needed it

has apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the  chip in the centris

not quite the point to be considdered here

fact ifwhen apple release system  or what ever is current at the time of release then you will see shortly afterwards apple no longer producing hardwarelook at next with their nextstep to see what happens

who is going to pay apples prices when they can get the same thing cheaper else where

heck we can get a sun workstation cheaper than a quadra and infact we have a number of times

 it all comes down to    if apple released this before windows 

was released id be behind them   they missed the boat

so why is apple continued development

will it   support the p to its fullest capabilities

run faster than windows

it   must do something significantly better than windows and os to warrent   being released

no the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less profit in hardware so the next step no pun intendedwell sort of is to make the money in software look at microsoft if you think it cant happen after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to one hardware platform

as you also said windows is a nightmare for programmers so will the temptation to sell system  to a couple of million dos users be too much for apple

million copies   is serious money

in article wgwcpdlynetcomcom wgwnetcomcom william g wright writes   anyway i was hoping someone knowledgeable  about mac internals could set me straight is it simply  impossible for a mac se to print grayscale or could  someone armed with enough info and a little pro  gramming experience cook something up that would  supplement the roms capabilities

to use the grayscale features i believe you need a mac equipped with colour quickdraw

i was told this somewhere or other but its not mentioned in apple facts guide for apple sellers in the press release or in the technical specs

sean i think you will find that the mac se can print grayscale images loaded with the proper software

however the mac se cannot display grayscale on its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the rom

so while you might be able to print grayscale youd have a hard time seeing the grayscale image you want to print

from pinogammowberkeleyedu jose l pino subject re wrong ram in duo

organization u c berkeley lines  distribution world nntppostinghost gammowberkeleyedu here is the macweek article describing the duo ram situation

wo permission

i hope that is ok jose bad ram brings some duos down

random access memory boards for apple macintosh powerbook duos macweek v n feb  

copyright coastal associates publishing lp  by raines cohen austin texas  some thirdparty memoryexpansion cards for powerbook duos depart from apple specs in ways that could cause crashes data loss and other problems

technology works inc a ram and network vendor based here last week issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in duo ram products from some competing vendors which it declined to identify

other vendors and an apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist

 selfrefresh

the duos require a kind of dynamic ram called selfrefreshing which can recharge itself while the system sleeps

but technology works said some vendors have sold duo cards with nonselfrefreshing dram which can cause the system to lose data or fail to wake from sleep

most leading memory manufacturers include the letter v in the part number stamped on their selfrefreshing chips nonselfrefreshing chips instead have an l according to techworks

the chip label however may not tell the whole story

newer technology of wichita kan said it uses nonselfrefreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed while the duo sleeps

 speed

some ramcard vendors have put nanosecond dram on duo cards rather than the nanosecond type the  requires technology works said

however some chips labeled as  or nanosecond are certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed

kingston technology corp of fountain valley calif said it offers duo ram cards with nanosecond chips but only for the duo  which is compatible with the slower chips

 space

technology works charged and apple officials confirmed that some thirdparty cards are too large to fit properly forcing the corner of the duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally when in a duo dock

lifetime memory products inc of huntington beach calif said it originally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all customers free upgrades to cards that fit

 i recently purchased a centris  and a mirror technologies  inch  mono monitor

im wondering if it is ok to set the monitor on top  of the cpu

the monitor weighs  lbs

  ive called apple

the person i spoke with was not sure but was  going to find out and call me back in a couple of days

that was  over a week ago   if anybody knows please respond via email as i dont always have time  to read this group

thanks

  david berk  dberkuiucedu yea thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup i was prepared for lots of details even shipping time  got my c cd in  weeks

i guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written specs and documentation

the case load spec is an example  the setup section says apple  and  monitors can go on top but  and other big ones cant

why couldnt they publish a maximum load

now if i can figure out if theres any hope using the partition button on the hard disk setup utility do i dare just try it and see what happens then maybe i can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more securly

the getting more information section of the manual suggested trying other avenues before calling apple but didnt mention the net

whether the drive is hooked up to the computer or not the lps makes a disk seek noise every  seconds

this is consistent and will continue as lomg as the drive is powered up

even if i disconnect the drive from the computer this drive activity continues at  second intervals

 someone tried to tell me the drive was doing a thermal recalibration

 not knowing beans about the internal physical workings of the lastest disk drive technology

i guess i might believe anything

 whats the scoop on this standalone drive activity every  sec

i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general

some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes

basically the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance since when the media heats up or cools down some track drift is inevitable and the drive has to monitor it

this becomes especially critical at very high recording densities and so was used primarily on very largecapacity mechanisms but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drives longterm reliability and mtbf ratings

i first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing say audio or video to hard disk

some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are not to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes

hope this helps

 afterall apples literature is not always  correct

a funny one i  noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the macs with cd  capability refer to the auto inkjet feature

this should have read auto  inject feature as it does on some other correct brochures ive seen from  apple

since it was correct on some older brochures i can only guess  that someone edited the copy saw inject and thought it was a typo and  changed it to the more familiar word inkjet

  hmmm what would that be

in article pyramidpyramidcom andrempyrtechmispyramidcom andre molyneux writes  in article qksuqtthalgnuaimitedu mirskyhalgnuaimitedu  david joshua mirsky writes   hi

i own an lciii and i recently heard an interesting rumor

  i heard that the lciii has a built in slot for a powerpc chip

  is this true

i heard that the slot is not the same as the pds   slot

is that true

    thanks   david mirsky   mirskygnuaimitedu   well i also have an lc iii

popping the top revealed   one socket for an additional vram simm   one socket for a pin ram simm   one socket for a flatpack fpu   a processordirect slot pds identical to the lclc ii but with  an additional set of connetions to one side for the full bit  data path that the lclc ii lacked   thats it

i guess a board with a powerpc chip could be made that would fit  in the pds but thats the only place

 so will it be possible to have a nubus or pds powerpc upgrade or will it require a logic board swap

it would be interesting for apple to come out with a nubus powerpc that allowed use of the cpus x like rocketshare

but i guess thats getting a bit fantastic

 i was wondering since macweek reported that developers were seeded with powerpcs on a nubus card

 also any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed

last i heard the estimates were around  times the speed of a quadra in native risc mode

i heard an apple employee mumble something about the arrival of powerpc machines at a much earlier date that q  but i doubt its true

 finally is the powerpc developers cd minicourse available

i saw it advertised in the developers university calendar and id like to know if its at all interesting

 sean  seanmcdacdalca radius speculated publicly that they could provide a powerpcbased rocket for existing macs

it would have the plus of rocketshare and the minus of nubus accelerators  no true boot off the accelerator nubus bottleneck to video and other io

apple it seems will not compete with third parties here  except perhaps for notyetavailable macs like cyclone where a powerpc slot might be advertised

look for daystar and such to make powerpc accelerators

one potential problem with any accelerator though is that it will need a rom companion and apple has licensed only radius with rocketshare to use any of its proprietary code

apple is between the lines trying to let us know that powerpc macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of risc and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing  macs

perhaps then well see groundbreaking prices in maclogic board upgrades much the same way weve seen much cheaper highperformance cpus this year

first generation powerpcs s will also hopefully have socketed cpus so that theyll be chip upgradeable to s a year later

this should be possible in much the same way that s can be pulled for clock doublers

if there is too much technical baggage which i doubt since the external busses are the same sizewidth to do this perhaps we can have cpu daughterboard a la powerbook as standard to facilitate better cpu upgrades

this is an area where apple has fallen far behing the intelbased world

perhaps catchup is in order

by the way last weeks pc week had an excellent story on powerpc pentium mips r dec alpha the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future

worth reading for technojunkies

also the latest pc has a cover story on pentium

read it and all the other stories about how intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now

once anyone is this secure they are due to fall

intels market position will never again be as dominant as it is today especially if amd gets the go ahead to sell its s this week as it appears it might

the competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle

apple users should be excited that powerpc while not guaranteed dominance is a guaranteed winner even if its one of several

if any brave souls out there have done this before please email your experience directly to me

i would greatly appreciate it especially since apples original keyboard is not 





ergonomically correct

btw i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj jack and the adb since it has both but no such luck the connections are soldered inside of little boxes

 i had asked everyone about problems installing a  meg  simm and an  meg simm in my centris  but the folks at the  local apple store called the folks in cupertino and found that  you cant have simms of different speeds in one machine even  if they are both fast enough  ie  my  ns  meg and ns   meg simms were incompatibable just thought people might  want to know theres absolutely no reason why differences in the dram access time alone would cause an incompatibility

there would have to be another difference between the simms for there to be a problem

ive often used memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever

as long as its as fast or faster than the minimum requirement you should be fine

just out of curiosity did you actually try this and see a problem or were you told it wouldnt work and so never tried it

also out of curiosity do you know exactly who in cupertino you dealer talked to as id like to find out what theyre basing this recommendation on

on a related note what does the monitor connector connect to

erik

i believe it goes or will go  powerpc pentium        i think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general

the processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose

comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things

i mean how can you say a  is faster than a  without giving is operational conditions

can you say the same when you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions

knowing that  does not have transidental functions building in to its fpu and  does can you say that  is still faster

anyway i hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor

or how fast a processor is based on its name because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up

but if we restrict our arguements to for example pure processor architectural issues

or how one processor will work well and another will not based on its design then we can get somewhere with our discussions

chung yang in a resent article in one of the macmags i think a mhz  accelerator was  slightly slower than a mhz  accel

but this is using a system designed  for the 

so it stands to reason that a system designed for an  ie  quadra would do better

so overall id figure     

or so

 along the same lines the new powerpc stuff is supposed to run the system  at the level of a fast quadra but system  or whatever will allow  times the  speed of a  in the powerpc based systems

and wait for the

i dont know if there is a software that can test simms thoroughly or i could just rely on the ram test performed by my computer during the start up

when i installed a dead simm into an lc or an lc ii there would be a strange music and no display on the screen

why

i need your help

thanks in advance yihtyng ytwumagnusacsohiostateedu there is a shareware ramchecker that i think is called ramcheck

it is available at most ftp sites such as umich and sumex

 could someone post a definitive answer about the vram configuration  for the  q and presumably the c and c as well

there seems to be a  lot of  confusion about this issue

id like to know   

what kind of simms are the vram simms ie

pin etc

theres only one physical size for vram simms unlike dram simms which come in many many sizes and pinouts although they do come with differing amounts of vram on them

the ones you need are kb simms are organized as k x  and have two k x  vram chips on them

this is the only size which the quadra and centris machines can use

 

how many vram simm slots are there

two

 

what rules if any must be followed in filling the slots eg in  pairs sizes must match etc

both simm slots must be filled putting a simm in only one slot does nothing for you

 

how fast must they be

ns for the q and c  ns for the c  

is there any other relevant information

there are certain vram chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible with the quadra and centris video hardware

make sure that the source you get them from guarantees compatiblity

in general if it works in a q it will work in a q

 please dont reply unless you have the correct information

many  thanks in  advance for helping to eliminate some noise from this group

jim trascapoulos  jtrascapnyxduedu  what size id do you wear

 a while ago i posted a note asking for specs on the quadra  and opinions on the q upgrade of a iici vs an accelerator card

so far no responsed that ive noticed

please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade paths cost efficiency proscons etc

thanks

complete q are best obtained from your dealer or some recent copy of macworld or macuser

my foggy memory suggests that the most relevant comparison factors visavis a iici are as follows  mhz   mhz data path dont recall this for sure but its slower than q  style machines for sure

ethertalk card onboard audio inout  mb ram on motherboard  simm slots  nubus slots

more flexible buildin video than the ci

uses vram

in comparison a iici with an accelerator wont give you audio or ethernet or the same video options

with a  accelerator cpu performance can be comparable but i think it ends up costing more

sometimes this doesnt even work for a long time

if you get teh iivx c upgrade does it include a new sticker to cover the iivx identifier with a centris  indetifier

i cant say for sure with the iivx  c upgrade but i wondered the same thing when i ordered my lc  lc iii upgrade

turns out the upgrade is actually an entire cpu minus any disk drives

you pull the floppy and hard drives out of the old one stick them in the new one and youve got an lc iii

the iivx  c may be the same thing

it might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that apple only sells macs prepackaged with the drives

of course the price is quite a bit higher without the tradein brian cherkaueeerochesteredu

 i want to go from k to m vram on my quadra 

how many k simms  do i  need to buy

is the current k soldered on the board or do i need to take  out the current vram before i add more

you need to add two k vram simms k vram simms will not work in any of the quadra or centris machines

there is already k of vram soldered to the logic board

you add the two k simms to this to give you a total of  mb

you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational prices

i would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices

i went for a retailer actually mail order cda computers because its price was better thant the campus computer store

i found out why later on when i tried to get a repair done at an apple registered repair center  the cpu was a resale

the serial number had been removed and replaced with a nonstandard number probably from cda computers

consequently the apple repair man could not do any warrenty repairs

so i ended up with just a day warrenty from cda over the apple month warrenty

boy was i pied

moral of the story caveat emptor

however if you go with a reliable trustworthy mail order firm if they exist  maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences you will probably get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order out of state does not require sales tax yet

though for how much longer remains to be seen

the addition in sales tax on a cpu purchase will probably wipe out an educational discount

again caveat emptor some mail order companies do include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state so check

i am looking for one of those color lcd screens you place on an overhead projector and control the presentation with a mac

can you recommend me a particular brand

what price are we talking about

for a good display you must get an active matrix panel and a very bright overhead projector designed to be used with an lcd panel ie

stage must not get too hot

i tried out a proxima ovation unit and liked it but i needed a brighter projector i used it with a m 

it is also too expensive for what you get imho

prices of active matrix panels are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year something to do with tarrifs being lifted i think

in canadian dollars the proxima ovation models ranged in price from about  to  and a good overhead projector about  to 

for that kind of money you can get a brighter image from a three beam projector but sacrifice portability

oh yes proper room lighting is extremely important especially if you want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that light wash out your display at the front of the room

from steedbellmacrocosmomahugorg steed bell subject  networking  how to get  ma replyto steedbellmacrocosmomahugorg organization the macrocosm bbs lawrence ks lines  peter im sure someone out there has a bettereasier way to do what you want to do but ill tell you how we do it where i work

we have about  macs networked together using appletalk and phonenet connectors

to chat we use a program called broadcast

with it we can send brief messages to all or selected machines within the network

hope that helps steed

my advisor has decided to get a mac for the lab now that we are funded again

 the consensus in the lab was that all we really needed was an lciii but he decided he wanted a centris 

the lack of an fpu on that machine and the price struck me as making it worth less than an lciii so i have suggested we get a iivx instead

it seems heavily expandable and for  what do people with iivxs think of them

they seem like good machines to me and i like the nubus slots in case we ultimately decide we want to do work with video on it

the iivxlciii performance at a centris  price

the only reason to get an iivx is if you really need the fullsize nubus slots

keep in mind that the  supports all apple monitors and has optional ethernet

this lessens but doesnt eliminate the need for nubus cards

and unless youre running fpuintensive software the  will blow the doors off the lciii and the iivx

the lciii on the other hand is sufficient for most people and has a great price

if you havent guessed i find halving the bus clock the iivx mhz up vs mhz bus a throughly bad thing and i hope apple never does it again

joe finete  jfinetecatsucscedu 

there is no reason that apple couldnt release software patches for older computers there are lots of mac pluses classics and ses that have been upgraded to  and  processors which should be perfectly able to deal with color quickdraw  but they wont and rd parties are having a difficult there is one reason market size

the market size for color quickdraw for accellerated plusses and ses which dont go beyond  mb anyway is just too small the extra cost would belike  and with that money you can buy a color classic instead

but the following games only play out of the left channel lemmings out of this world awesome game btw glider

all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates  he cant run ootw because he doesnt have color

were both running system 

does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class quadra lc powerbook  or greater centris se etc stereo machine

i used to have a mac ii and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in stereo on that machine not just on the left channel

i could be mistaken though

if there were a problem with the quad s and pb s i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo

if there isnt a problem with our machines i wonder why the  games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers like spectre etc

do

quadra s and powerbook s have the same roms to my knowledge so maybe this is a rom problem

 the pb has been used running zterm and kermit using both internal and external modems so i dont think its the powerbook per se

 when i send a  to the hp it responds with aa  a test of the serial ports

it works on the se but not on the pb

 i thought that the se is connected to earth ground and so is the hp

so i connected from the chassis of the hp to the pw audio ground connector still ng

 any thoughts

battery powered devices like the powerbook are sometimes more sensitive to serial port weirdness

i had trouble with connecting my mac plus to an hp lx handheld

everything else worked okay on that port but not the hp

it runs on two penlite batteries

it turned out that the plus by accident or by design flaw

was putting a  volt bias on the serial port that was doing weird things to the hp which has only v dc

the hp worked fine when connected to the printer port

does your pb screen get dim or anything when connected to the device

have you tried using the printer port

shure it is temperature dependent but this does not clean all your problems

based on some exp

i must say that the connections between the power supply and the monitor and main board are usable to this failure ram simms can be badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the last phase lower voltage

so you can do following if you are used to such technical terms

clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray  readjust the  volt level of your powersupply  use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowin through the floppy

a fixed piece of paper can prevent this if you dont know how to do it beg a friendly technician

the trackbal on my pb no longer moves in the horizontal direction

when i called the nearest authorized apple service person i was told that it probably needed replacing and that would cost me over 

ouch

 can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem

one strange symptom of the problem is that when i take the ball out of the socket and shine a light into the hole i can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the wheel with my finger it works fine that way but wont work if i turn off the light

any suggestions or comments

 ben roy just a poor college studentinternetbraamericanedu  ben since youre obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works the only thing short of repairing it that i can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers

since they arent fixed in position on their stainless steel pins you might try sliding them into a slightly different position

on my powerbook  i can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball

in fact one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its edge contacts the ball not the center cylindrical area

ive done this with my pb and it does seem to improve the feel but needs to be adjusted from time to time

i just popped open one of our offices pbs and while there isnt as much latitude for movement one could still adjust the roller slightly

if your pb is the same it might help

i would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller

if you can take it out clean it with a mild soapy solution or isopropyl alcohol

also be sure the ball is greasefree

if you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin

if all this still doesnt solve it then maybe a new one is in order

 it could be an electrical connection in which case replacement would be necessary

but my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem not an electrical malfunction

from  subject re quadra scsi problems

organization apple computer inc lines   attention mac quadra owners many storage industry experts have  concluded that mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating  from the standard scsi specification

this results in silent corruption  of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices

 although i will not name the devices since it is not their fault an  example would be a sony 

inch mo without the special maccompatible  firmware installed

one solution sometimes is to disable blind writes  to the best of my knowledge there arent any problems with quadras and blind transfers

trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the tibs or didnt test their driver with the device in question

well designed tibs poll or loop at every point where delays of sec occur

this usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can hiccup in the middle of blocks

if this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going

in anycase the scsi manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync

actual data loss would only occur if the driver didnt pay attention to the errors coming back

lowell    lowell reiter i need a vacation

now

 tufts university   internet account lreiterjadetuftsedu   i have the same problem and was about to post this hello duo owners and apple technical people  i have a new duo  which appears to have a problem waking up from sleep when running on battery power

when woken usually for the second time after sleeping the wake fails and the screen appears with a corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be recovered with controlcommandpoweron or the reset key at the back of the machine

the problem occurs even when the system is stock standard no extensions no virtual memory a fully charged new battery system 

etc

i have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to ac

ive checked that the battery is properly seated it appears to be fine

whats going on here 

anyone else had this problem 

is it software or hardware 

if you have a duo  and a bit of time try repeatedly sleeping and waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same behaviour and let apple know too 

many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me

bruce  bruce tulloch sydney australia  brucetextrouccsuozau complex problems have straight forward easy to understand wrong answers

this is an aside to brian hughess please lets lose the cute phony names everybody posting about adding memory to a quadra 

what phony names

my name is clearly visible in the headers and i sing the post with my account name

if you have a problem with that then you will have to get over it

ive used this account name for over  years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last  generally recognize hades as my account name

i have no intention of changing the way i post

i installed a couple of mb simms in my quadra and was somewhat dismayed by the general complexity of the operation compared to for example the wonderfully designed lc iii

it irritates me when apple refuses to tell how to do it in the users manual so you have to guess at how to disassemble the devise in question its the same for adding memory to laserwriter pros

it isnt apples responsibility to tell its customers how to fool around with its hardware

that is what apple service techs get paid to do

i personally like the design of the q and applaud apple for coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of those drive bays

i like it a lot better than the  design except for those people who need drive arrays

i do however agree with you about the lw pro design

the operation isnt very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were offered but apple leaves you working blind

again itss not apples place to make it easy for noncertified service people to fool around with apple hardware even if they did buy it

of course you are free to do what you want to your mac just dont get upset when your apple service rep tells you that your warranty is no longer valid

after the memory was installed i was distraught that the top of the simms came into contact with the plastic case frame

mine actually contacted the framework with quite a lot of pressure  enough so that the assembly of the board back to the proper position was rather difficult and required some force

i could have filed a little excess material off the top of the simm boards but chose to let it stand as is

i have not had problems with ram yet so i will consider the problem annoying but not catastrophic

this sounds like the kind of problem i had when i installed mb simms into an lc back before lowprofile mb simms were readily available

the standard mb simms would contact the top of the case and make it a bit difficult to close the lc but it did close and work just fine

one of the nice things about logicboards is that they are generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure

yes  what cpu is in the mac portable

a low power version of the  running at 

mhz

does the mac portable run system 

yes although it does use up a lot of memory

is memory still availabe for the portable

there are several vendors that still make ram for the portable

there are two options some vendors sell memory that plugs into the ram slot inside the portable

others sell memory that plugs into the processor direct slot

either way the most memory you can address is either  or  megabytes depending on whether the portable is backlit or not

king memory and peripherials in irvine california is the cheapest place i know of for portable memory

i still see several ads in macuser that are selling  mb modules for 

wide variety in pricing here

what is the internal hd

its a conner cp  mb hd with an average access time of about  ms  is the screen better that the pb 

heavens yes

the pb  is a backlit passive matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move your head a few degrees left or right

the portable has a backlit or nonbacklit active matrix screen which i think is a joy to read

other things to consider  where to get the portable and how much to pay for it

a good supplier has been selectterm in mass

they were willing to sell a mb nonbacklit portable with an internal  bps modem for about 

or a  mb backlit portable with an internal  bps modem for about

in article ciznkyvcsdalca hayesugcsdalca kevin b hayes writes you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational prices

 i would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices

i went for a retailer actually mail order cda computers because its price was better thant the campus computer store

i found out why later on when i tried to get a repair done at an apple registered repair center  the cpu was a resale

the serial number had been removed and replaced with a nonstandard number probably from cda computers

consequently the apple repair man could not do any warrenty repairs

so i ended up with just a day warrenty from cda over the apple month warrenty

boy was i pied

moral of the story caveat emptor

apple does not authorise sales through mail order

as a result mail order companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market

this market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have more machines than they can sell

they come into this state of affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better wholsale price from apple

in either case they often obscure the serial nunber to protect their identity

as a result the warranty is void

you may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping

i should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer cost

as a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs and trimming margins

unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well

the lowest prices i have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest prices available from authorised local dealers

they are even further away from educational prices

dear netters  my sister has an apple  color display hooked up to an lc

 problem there is an annoying horizontal ghostlike stripe that precesses vertically about once per second

it is about  cm high

she is in grave danger of going insane because of it

 any ideas of what it might be and how i might cure it for her

 joe betts bettsnetcomcom  ps if i pick up the display i thought it might be rfi from the lc it seems to get worse

 this can be caused by two one of two things

the first and easiest to fix is interference from something around the monitor such as another monitor or other electrical device

try moving the system to another location to fix that problem

second because of the scan rate of the monitor it tends to synchronize with room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing

try turning off all lights in the rooms around the system and see if that helps

if not try moving the system somewhere else

a third solution would be to get a  apple color display  it should not have the same problem the  color is more suceptible to

you can try calling apples new support number in the us at sosapple

this number is for anyone who has questions regarding macintosh setup and compatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on monday april

as the author of dpi on the fry i can tell you that there is no way for a graphics card to know what resolution its connected monitor will actually support

thats why we have these silly cables

the cable just identifies that monitor as supporting a given resolution

 therefore the software will support any multisync monitor

ive heard that radius has a similar program for the quadra

is this software available either commercially or public domain

i believe apple has a patent on the region features of quickdraw

a mac clone would have to implement regions

this is why apples comment was that they believe it is not possible to make a mac clone without infringing on their patents

they may have other patents like this

apple has patented their implementation of regions which presumably includes the internal data structure which has never been officially documented by apple

apple cannot patent the concept of a region

im guessing that either nutek reverseengineered apples internal data structure for regions i dunno if this would hold up in court or they came up with their own data structure

if its the latter then they wont be able to draw pict files containing regions

besides pict files there arent many places where regions are stored on disk

quicktime movies perhaps

as long as the region isnt being stored on disk and transferred from a mac to a nutek clone or vice versa it doesnt matter if nutek uses a completely different internal data structure

i remember reading that apple also has a patent on their adb hardware and that the nutek clones would therefore be lacking an adb port

what other patents does apple have on the mac

ive noticed an interesting phenomenon on my centris 

if i unplug the keyboard and mouse and plug them in again without turning the power off the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed

i check the mouse control panel and theres no change in its setting thereits still on full speed the way i like it

restarting the machine restores the normal mouse speed

 by the way it happens with both the newerstyle mouse that came with the centris and the olderstyle mouse from my iifx at work

thus i dont think it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouseits definitely a quirk of the adb interface either hardware or software in the centris itself

i have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my lciii

perhaps it is a quirk of the new machines

enter game developers

the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games

the sound driver is pretty ok since its fast

sound manager used by the book is useless

disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation

its too slow

the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager

unfortunately system  supports it poorly making programs crash occasionally

the more of the story is to developers dont cheat

really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but im going say it anyway

stop cheating on sound

really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware

the grace period is about to end

the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it

well i want my code to work on old systems too

i dont know about sys  but at least on  there are bugs in the sound manager that causes channels to hang with no error message

this happends when i keep a channel open for long periods  necessary for performance  and play many sounds stopping sounds halfway

callbacks seems not to be reliable

then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel qhead i think it was and the only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an undocumented flag and modify it

am i happy with this

nope

i consider writing to soundbase simply to get rid of the bugs

  mmillergarnetmsencom marvin miller writes  my friend recently purchased a lc iii and he wants to know if there is  such a demon called nubus adapter for his pds slot

  the lc family of macs can only   use pds cards

they are not able to use nubus

 ah but why

can some technicallyhip macslinger tell us what the  difference is between pds and nubus

 is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into pds and ends in a  nubus card cage

at least marvins friend has not been able to  locate one and neither have i

what is the fundamental reason for  this

i think that there do exist nubus expansion cages im sure ive seen them advertised occassionally but i think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a lc and iivx so unless you need lots of nubus slots its not worth the bother

of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive nubus technology isnt a special apple proprietry thing i have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from texas instruments

so there is no problem building an expansion box

the difference between nubus and pds is that nubus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer

pds processor direct slot is just that here are all the connections to the processor

you can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be but theres no cooperation

you may be able to get double pds slot adaptors but you try plugging  video cards in and just watch them conflict

of course the extra electronics in a nubus slot makes it appreciably more expensive so guess why apple doesnt put it in its cheaper machines

so yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice

their should be no difference in the drive itself between ibmpc and mac

the two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself but with the correct software each can read the others and maybe the cable depends on your scsi board on ibmpc

association mac bbs grand blanc mi lines  eu apple does not authorise sales through mail order

as a result mail eu order companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market

eu eu this market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who eu have more machines than they can sell

they come into this state of eu affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a eu better wholsale price from apple

in either case they often obscure eu the serial nunber to protect their identity

as a result the warranty eu is void

i have ordered several macs from different mail order companies with absolutely zero problem

you have to dig around to find the true gray market dealers that sell macs with authentic serial numbers untouched

there are valueadded dealers nothing to do with vat no flame please that are very legitimate

cda unfortunately is one of those that replace the serial number with their own to prevent apple from tracing which authorized dealer sold that machine to cda

organization university of washington school of law class of  lines  nntppostinghost steinuwashingtonedu keywords quadra scsi aps  attention mac quadra owners many storage industry experts have  concluded that mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating  from the standard scsi specification

this results in silent corruption  of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices

 although i will not name the devices since it is not their fault an  example would be a sony 

inch mo without the special maccompatible  firmware installed

one solution sometimes is to disable blind writes this doesnt sound right to me

dont quadras use the c

if so the mac has nothing to do with the scsi timing

thats all handled by the chip

about the only the timing could be wrong is if apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 

that however should only really hurt synchronous transfer which is not used by the mac scsi manager

furthermore disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a quadra

on macs that used the  which is a much lower level scsi chip the mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred

blind mode affected how the mac handled that handshake

on the  the handshake is entirely handled by the chip

from ejbehrrscmpilstuedu eric behr subject asante ensc hangs scsi devices replyto behrmathilstuedu eric behr organization central illinois surfing club lines  i just hooked up my mac iisi to a relatively old  year

asante ensc adapter

the baset connection works like a charm

i installed the newest drivers from asantes ftp server

the problem begins when i attach one more device to the scsi chain  specifically a mb drive

i power up the drive then the mac

the mac tests memory etc

just before the happy mac face normally shows up the power light on the ensc goes out and the boot process stops

so i can use the network or the external drive but not both at once

this makes the asante box pretty much unusable

it doesnt look like a purely electrical scsi problem because if i turn on the drive just a second or so too late so that it doesnt get noticed during the initial scsi polling the mac boots normally and the adapter works even though the hard disk is powered on and connected

the mac has never once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now and ive had it for over a year

here is what i tried changing the scsi ids of the ensc and the disk  several permutations changing the order of devices ie

the ensc at the head or tail of the chain overterminating with an external terminator both devices have internal ones underterminating ie

removing internal resistors from the hard disk trying another ensc box trying another identical drive trying several different scsi cables

has anybody seen this

more importantly does anyone have a solution

thanks a lot

 there isnt any copyright equivalent of the res ipsa doctrine  but theres something kind of similar

to show infringement one  element you need to show is that the defendant copied from your work

 if youre lucky youll have direct evidence of copying  the smoking  gun

normally you do this through circumstantial evidence by showing  evidence of access from which one might reasonably infer copying

 this evidence of access is considered along with the similarities  between the two works in deciding whether you copied

however if  the similarities are so strong as to be striking an inference of  copying may be drawn even without any evidence that the defendant had  access to your copyrighted work

  in that case the burden will be on the defendant to rebut the inference  of copying

for example evidence that hed been on a desert island for  the last ten years and had no contact with civilization

 i have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection  between a mac duo  and a pc

i have used mackermit and versaterm on  the mac side

i have used procomm kermit and softerm on os on  the pc or ps side

i have used nonhardware handshaking and hardware  ahdshaking cables

and know my hands are shaking from the effort

nothing  has allowed file transfers from the mac to the ps

  could i hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information  out the serial port of a duo  fast

like via a modem or via a  sysex dump

  could anyone with a duo help me out

i am going absolutely insane

 i wanna know if the problem is my duo or all duo s or all duos  or just me

 hmmm

sounds vaguely similar to a problem i had a long time ago when i was trying to use kermit

i was building a serial connection between my duo  and my next

i think the problem was in the handshaking

basically you need to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides

a safe place to start is by selecting no handshaking on either end

one problem is that the zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it wrong and only a reset will clear it

i dont know the specifics

but this could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system

it could very well be that you are doing things righteventually but one wrong move like trying a bad handshaking protocol can screw up any further correct actions until the next machine reset

i have wedged my mac and also my next that way

now i can send files back and forth between the duo and the next without any problem and at pretty high speeds too

i dont know what kind of chip the pc uses but i think the zilog  is pretty standard

hope this helps avery

chesscatsucscedu brian vantuyl chess writes  i just got a duo  and im having some difficulties

if the machine is plugged in to the wall adapter put to sleep unplugged from the wall and woken up it crashes  of the time

theres nothing but the original system software on the machine

the battery has plenty of life  i think this must be a power manager problem but i dont know what to do about it

also the speaker occasionally makes a highpitched hiss

the noise is irregular but seems to favor sleep and restart commands

ive had my duo  for a few weeks now and suffer from both of the above problems

i reinstalled my system software twice in an effort to combat the problems  thinking they were system software problems

initially reinstalling the system seemed to help but not anymore

occasionally when i try to wake up the duo i get a solid screen of horizontal lines on the screen  it freezes

i also get the highpitched hiss occasionally  but only at startup

ive called the apple hotline  sosappl three times already and finally they agreed something is astray after my duos screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by itselft and put itself to sleep

this problem only occured twice

apple sent me a box to ship my duo to be looked at in new york but the problem now is intermittent and i cant afford to be without my duo at this time

anyone out there with these same problems

 brian cherkas   bcherkasnetcomcom  i aolbrianc  compuserve netcom  online communication services san jose ca yes quite a number of people it seems from discussions ive had me included

i bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems

apple australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes  faulty applications faulty third party hardware modems memory etc system software pram corruption and power manager corruption and the duo hardware itself

none of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe no applications were running the system software was reinstalled i have no additional hardware

i have found that clearing pram appears to help for a while at least hold down command option p and r on startup

unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that pram is being corrupted by something system software bug 

i dont have any nonissue inits in my system

apparently the power manager can be reset by holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up  apples advice  but since the duo does not have an interrupt button im not sure what they mean in this case

this may also help if someone can decipher apples advice for me

beyond this apple suggest that  you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this duo

since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line  and quite recently too  since it only seems to be recent duo  purchasers who have this problem

my point is that out the box the  has more video capability for the same size monitors

ive noticed an interesting phenomenon on my centris 

if i unplug the keyboard and mouse and plug them in again without turning the power off the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed

i check the mouse control panel and theres no change in its setting thereits still on full speed the way i like it

restarting the machine restores the normal mouse speed

 by the way it happens with both the newerstyle mouse that came with the centris and the olderstyle mouse from my iifx at work

thus i dont think it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouseits definitely a quirk of the adb interface either hardware or software in the centris itself

i have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my lciii

perhaps it is a quirk of the new machines

you probably want to hardwire the scsi id with shorting jumpers

you could cut a hole in the back of the machine to route the id switch but why go through the hassle

you probably wont be needing to frequently change the id of your internal drive

would that cause problems

but its no problem the device is designed to fit just fine with the overhang

it shouldnt reach back beyond the romramvram simms though

 one last question

is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover

the drives front panel is smaller than the space left in the case the drives panel is the same size as the spotsbm clones cases

should i just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place

you can specialorder parts to mount the device from your local apple dealer

the relevant parts are  blank bezel faceplate  cdrom carrier ie generic 

device mounting bracket note apples unfortunate choice of name for the slidein bracket to mount a 

device

the service techs i talked to said oh sure we stock those

of course they were thinking of the cd caddies to hold a cd disk when you stick it in the drive

as far as i can tell apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already cut out for a standard 

device

why not

they advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 

bay why not provide the faceplate

they do sell a cutout for their cdrom drive of course but thats of no use

im going to hack up the extra bezel i ordered to make a cutout for my tape drive which is a standard

the one in the back of the machine doesnt work either  the only way i can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes  then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately  sometimes this doesnt even work for a long time tj this problem is most likely the same that all cx users are experiencing

thanks to one very adventurous usenet reader sorry i cant remember the guys name

somebody please post ithe deserves the credit for saving us all  it is easily fixed if it is the same problem best i can figure it is due to time heat and repeated warmupcool downs in the power supplyie bad solder joints in the power supply circuit card

go get a desolder tool from radio shack a low wattage iron and some good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit card with the ac plugs facing away from youor get someone to do it for you

monitor problems nec d  iivi nntppostinghost lkhphutfi replyto jartsuvipunenhutfi organization helsinki university of technology finland lines  hello all

for few past days ive been fighting to get my nec multisync d predecessor of fg to work properly with the internal video of mac iivi

with a vgaadapter as described in dale adams posting about quadra video it works only some minor interferences occur small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible  clear

but because the scanrates  stuff of d are well enough for emulating apple  rgb i first made an adapter then got one fron the local distributor of nec

with both adapters i can get a picure which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then

but with radical changes on screen opening palettes large windows etc

there are major interferences in sync

the picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally

even when it is clear there are some spiky interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pulldowns etc

with the selfmade adapter almost identical to the vga one only sense pins differ it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu with the adapter from nec everything is well most of the time but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost

but not nearly as often as with the selfmade one

i know with self made adapters there can always be interference but with the one provided by nec wheres the source of this interference

ill give you the pinouts of the whole mess and i hope that you can at least someone please try  figure out what could be the best pin assignment for nec d i am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged especially syncs and groundings

from what we have heard air doesnt do  the trick

  software solutions would be good too but my impression is that  there arent going to be any

  our immediate interest is to be able to get to the next and telnet  out again

the slip connection doesnt allow us to assign ip numbers  to machines so everyone shares that  numberoh well  what you need is a hardware router such as etherroutetcp made by compatable systems 

this will allow you to connect your localtalk network  macs to your ethernet network next and ethernet mac

it will route tcpip protocol between the two networks

software routers are also available for less money but im not sure if they work with tcpip

sorry if this is a faq

i dont normally read compsysmachardware

i am purchasing a couple of centris s i configured the systems as follows  eight  mb ram  ethernet   mb vram  math coprocessor option my purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent me the apple summary documentation to prove it

i ordered the coprocessor option but im really not sure that we needed it

i thought the  chip had a math coprocessor built into it

has apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the  chip in the centris 

i am concerned that i may have set up a hardware bottleneck

apple has really confused people with this whole thing

i think well be answering this question for about the next year or so

there is no option to get an fpu on a c what you have is a choice of cpus there is the lc that does not have an integrated fpu like the full  and is only present in the base  model of the c appleusa

and there is the full  which you get when you order anything other than the base  configuration

therefore since you have ordered one of the mb versions with onboard ethernet models you will not be getting the lc

but even if you wanted to have the lc you wouldnt be able to order a c with mb ram onboard ethernet and an lc

its not an option

also a note to people out there that have  cs and cs thinking that there is an optional fpu the  class chip cannot recognize an external fpu so there is no socket on the motherboard for a fpu chip and you cannot go out and purchase an fpu on a pds card or something like that

the only way to get an fpu in these machines is to replace the lc with a full 

and if you have a c you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the lc with the full  but if you have a  c you do need to have a heat sink

is it possible to install a nd    mb hd in a mac ii with a    mb qunatum hd

can i us a  pin cable with  connectors for the internal motherboard scsiconnector and the  scsihd connectors

the first hd isnt terminated the second will be

whats about the power supply

where can i connect a   ampconnector to supply my   hd

it is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any macintosh if you can find the space to put it

i have a iisi that came with a quantum  meg drive

when i ran into space problems i slapped in another  meg quantum that i had sitting on a shelf

here is what i did

first off i was concerned about space

since both drives are quantum quarter height drives i finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other

fine they fit snugly

i have not had a problem with heat yet and these drives have been running together for over two months

the next problem was connecting the drive

if you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as i did then half of your troubles are over

just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors

if you dont have a spare cable you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about 

i would suggest properly solderingheatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections

next you need a ribbon cable connection

again i had a spare hard disk ribbon cable and i wanted to be careful in case this didnt word so what i did was purchase a crimp on  pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable

the part cost  again and is easily attached with any good wood vice

the theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesnt work my original cable is not damaged and i can go back to the original setup

having done all that i couldnt be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so i plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day

in a mac ii everything should work the same

be careful with the ids of the drive and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact

i did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if i am splitting the scsi chain that the signal should be terminated at all the ends

let me know if you have any more questions

but think of driver revisions

 it is easier to get driver kits from apple than from every other  manufacturer   christian bauer   bauerinformatikuniulmde    i thought nec and toshiba cdrom mechanism have an average access time of less than  ms

while the sonyapple cdrom drive has an access time of  ms for the doublespin models

  chung yang  the toshiba has a ms access time the nec has a ms access time right around the sonyapple

access time is of course somewhat important but not as vital in the case of cds as data transfer rate

all the drives are doublespeed drives with maximum data transfer rates of ksecond

any is a good choice

apples is very cheap when included with new macs and i agree with christians comment about drivers

plus apples is bootable on the centris and quadra 

a very nice feature if you need to install system software

after all it does sound unfair to me for someone that has  oops i meant fair not unfair

hi

i think i have a problem with the stereo sound output on my quadra  but i am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his powerbook 

any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated

 when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system the following types of sounds mono as far as i can tell all play fine through both speakers  system beeps already provided ones such as indigo and ones i record  armor alley spectre spaceward ho

  but the following games only play out of the left channel  lemmings out of this world awesome game btw glider 

oids   but still stereo system beeps do play in stereo through both speakers

the one im specifically referrring to is apocolyptic beginning which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex

  all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates  he cant run ootw because he doesnt have color

 were both running system 

   does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class quadra lc powerbook  or greater centris se etc stereo machine

 i used to have a mac ii and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in stereo on that machine not just on the left channel

i could be mistaken though

if there were a problem with the quad s and pb s i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo

if there isnt a problem with our machines i wonder why the  games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers like spectre etc

do

 quadra s and powerbook s have the same roms to my knowledge so maybe this is a rom problem

if so though why wouldnt system 

patch over this problem

    thanks for any help you can provide

in article aprkthse jon wtte djwahemulnadakthse writes mac sound hardware is diverse some macs play in stereo and mix the output the se for instance while others play in stereo but only has the left channel for the speaker while some are truly mono like the lc  developers know that stuff played in the left channel is guaranteed to be heard while the right channel isnt

some send data to both some only send data to the left channel the first is preferrable of course okay i guess its time for a quick explanation of mac sound

the original documentation for the sound hardware im documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware

basically you jam values into all the even bytes from soundbase to soundbasex

this was because of how the mac  and some later machines generated sound was by scanning this block and daing every even byte the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines

when the mac ii and apple sound chip was invented it was designed to generate stereo sound

it was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented

so storing bytes at the even values at soundbase meant i want to play a mono sound and so it was emulated

but apple had since retracted the documentation on soundbase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation

so apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound

enter game developers

the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games

furthermore people who port from the ibm dont want to learn more apis

so it has become popular for game writers to write to soundbase to make sound since it is very easy

since the mac ii apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware and the only things they have in common are that writing to soundbase works

on some hardware mac ii iix iicx iici at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound through both speakers

on some macs quadra  at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound on the left channel only

both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons

if developers use the sound manager and i think the sound driver mono sounds will typically come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware

it is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only but no one does

if developers write to sound base their games will only come out the left on some games

the other problem the original mac ii only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker while the se mixes both isnt really related

it is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines

it only affects true stereo sounds

sounds which are actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what machine you have

now to more directly address the question the games you list lemmings out of this world awesome game btw glider 

oids and also hellcats super tetris oxyd and many more these are just what ive tested cheat and write to soundbase and so are only left channel on quadras

other games you list armor alley spectre spaceward ho

and also pga tour golf civilization and more these are again only from personal experience use the sound manager and work fine on all machines

the more of the story is to developers dont cheat

really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but im going say it anyway

stop cheating on sound

really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware

the grace period is about to end

the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it

in conclusion to doug it isnt a hardware problem at least not a bug

to jon it isnt a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels

if they do it the right way it is taken care of automatically

if you cheat there is not way to make it work on all hardware

have fun

disclaimer number  i dont work on sound here at apple im just pretty well informed

so dont write me with sound questions

disclaimer number  if it says up above that i wrote anything like the grace period is about to end then it is a bug in your news feed since i am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that

you know what i mean

it is a ether scsi interface

apparently it can be plugged into a scsi port and from there to an ethernet

that way you save a slot

nifty

well i assume you people know more about it so judging by the  price tag new ill ask say 

anybody interested

 attention mac quadra owners many storage industry experts have  concluded that mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating  from the standard scsi specification

this results in silent corruption  of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices

 although i will not name the devices since it is not their fault an  example would be a sony 

inch mo without the special maccompatible  firmware installed

one solution sometimes is to disable blind writes this doesnt sound right to me

dont quadras use the c

if so the mac has nothing to do with the scsi timing

thats all handled by the chip

about the only the timing could be wrong is if apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 

that however should only really hurt synchronous transfer which is not used by the mac scsi manager

furthermore disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a quadra

on macs that used the  which is a much lower level scsi chip the mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred

blind mode affected how the mac handled that handshake

on the  the handshake is entirely handled by the chip

the docs say that its a scsi manager bug if this changes things at all  jim jagielski  and hes gonna stiff me

what i would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for their quality and performance

my preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both k and k floppies but handling k floppies is not a necessity

so far i only know a bit about the iomega floptical and the infinity floptical drives

are there any commentsrecommendations for either of these

are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where can they be purchased ie

which mail order places etc

thanks in advance

buntstudenttcumnedu monthian buntan writes   does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c regarding fpu

in all mac price lists ive seen every c has the message fpu optional

i know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all c have the fpu built in except the  configuration

why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list

i think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves

since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesnt have an fpu it does seem to be an option even though it really isnt

im planning to buy the c cd pretty soon but im now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not

well then allow me to end your confusion

the c only come with an lc in the base  configuration

if you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an fpu

why say optional if its built in

good question

i have been wondering that since feb th

if you get the centris  with cd configuration you are getting a mac with a rc processor that has builtin math coprocessor support

my understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the centris   without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu

this is possible but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it

what apple has done is given the buyer a choice between configurations and not an option

apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonfpu system to become an fpu system

and it is unclear whether the  processor on the nonfpu system a lc can be replaced with a rc supplied by another vendor

this is not unclear at all

in fact apple has included in the roms of those machines with lcs code to recognize the presence of the full s fpu and use it

thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips

you pop the lc out and pop in a full 

apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris  which only comes with a nonfpu lc processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu  the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again according to apples memo

they did

i think i would doublecheck this

it has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the centris hardware designers that the lc and the full  are pin compatible and that the c can be upgraded to a full

from ksloanucsvaxucsumassedu duncan m chesley subject dont repair that sticky mouse buttoncall apple

organization university of massachusetts  amherst lines  distribution world nntppostinghost deimosucsumassedu xnewsreader vms news 

xposted to compsysmachardware and miscconsumers  youve heard about apples great new customer support program

well think again

sometimes the only real support out there is what apple computer users can give to each other

for another example read on in the march th issue of macweek ric ford described a twoyear effort by liam breck to document and bring to apples attention a problem with certain defective mice

at random the switches on these mice stick in the down position until clicked a second time apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved

most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in malaysia and have an fcc id of bcga

youll recognize this sticky button symptom immediately if you have such a mouse the problem is intermittent but its not subtle

liam breck recently gave up trying to document this problem and instead suggested that people contact apples customer assistance center directly macweek  p 

when i called apple on march rd and described my defective mouse i was eventually given a case number fy and told apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty

after waiting for three weeks i called back today wondering where my new mouse was

this time i was told that apple had decided the serial number on my mouse mbfc is not within the undisclosed range apple is willing to replace and there is nothing i can do about it

nothing that is unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth apples while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice

please if you have one of these mice i need your help

dont assume you know what causes the problem there are lots of theories and start hacking around inside your hundreddollar mouse

instead let apple do it

please take five minutes to call apple right now at united states  canada  uk and europe  australia  japan and pacific  if the number isnt tollfree call collect

describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse

even if they refuse insist that they register the details of your case including your mouses serial number

be firm

network managers and usergroup leaders especially please query your user bases

everyone ask your friends and colleagues

please dont send mail to me or post yet another stickybutton report call apple directly

if enough victims take the trouble to report this wellknown problem apple will eventually be forced to respond

if apple continues to find it easy to stonewall on this issue dont expect them to offer support when the next potentially more serious mac defect is uncovered

yup

thats why im kinda curious most scsi problems ive encountered are due to cabling

i am working on a project for my marketing class and id like to ask your help

the assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it

technical issues are not terribly important at this point

well my groups plan is to market a full page monitor for laptop computers

it would be a thirdparty product to be installed by authorized repair centers like newer technologys palettebook screen

the idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen remember technical issues aside

in fact by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration you could have regular or full height

the screen would probably be monochrome

the motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people

business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document

because of the target users and applications color screens arent really a neccessity

we could hopefully keep the cost between  and 

now please dont write this off as completely ridiculous

i really need some constructive feedback

so if you would please reply to me via email and let me know 

if you would consider buying a full page laptop screen 

how much you would be willing to pay for it 

any helpful commentaries on the idea also if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it doubtful but who knows please send me some

thanks in advance

from shagbergvmcmpilstuedu subject updated keyboard question for the plus organization illinois state university lines  i have an old mac plus

a couple of years ago i bought a shiney new lc

it came with apples new keyboard with abd ports

i replaced it with a macproplus extended keyboard which i thoroughly enjoy thank you very much

well i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but theres a little problem

the plus uses an rj jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards dont

i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer theyre such nice people but they couldnt tell me the order of the wires

there are four wires in the adb cables black white red tan

i know ones a ground one gets the serial signal one supplies  volts and i forgot what the fourth one does

anyway if you hook them up wrong youll fry a board and i really dont want to do that

if any brave souls out there have done this before please email your experience directly to me

i would greatly appreciate it especially since apples original keyboard is not 





ergonomically correct

btw i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj jack and the adb since it has both but no such luck the connections are soldered inside of little boxes

oh well 





one more thing in case you are thinking that the abd ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus youre right

however you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the macproplus keyboard via its own rj jack

in other words this little engineering feat i wish to do is possible

its merely a matter of finding out the correct order

omt when i get this to work i definitely will post the solution so others can too

thanx for the input

tis the blink of an eye tis the draught of a breath   from the blossoms of health to the paleness of death   from the gilded saloon to the briar in the shroud   o why should the spirit of mortal be proud

i remember someone mention about a meg syquest

has anyone else heard anything about this

id be interested in the cost per megabyte and the approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the bernoulli 

i think you must be talking about the syquest  code named mesa i believe

it is a 

winchester technology drive pretty much like the other syquest drives in terms of how it works

according to the latest macleak the drive has a 

ms access time 

mbs sustained throughput these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless

the drive was originally released for the pc and just recently was released for the mac world dont ask me what the differences are and through they are currently in limited supply according to a syquest rep they are in the process of ramping up for mass production

i have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in macleak including pli massmicro clubmac and macwarehouses poweruser

the pli and massmicro units are priced at just around  the lesser name brands are going for around  for an external drive

cartridges which hold  mb sell for about  each

at these prices the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the mb drives

cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and bernoulli drives but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper and more reliable

personally im excited by the new drive and look forward to getting my hands on one

is it possible to install a nd    mb hd in a mac ii with a    mb qunatum hd

can i us a  pin cable with  connectors for the internal motherboard scsiconnector and the  scsihd connectors

the first hd isnt terminated the second will be

whats about the power supply

where can i connect a   ampconnector to supply my   hd

it is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any macintosh if you can find the space to put it

i have a iisi that came with a quantum  meg drive

when i ran into space problems i slapped in another  meg quantum that i had sitting on a shelf

here is what i did

first off i was concerned about space

since both drives are quantum quarter height drives i finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other

fine they fit snugly

i have not had a problem with heat yet and these drives have been running together for over two months

the next problem was connecting the drive

if you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as i did then half of your troubles are over

just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors

if you dont have a spare cable you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about 

i would suggest properly solderingheatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections

next you need a ribbon cable connection

again i had a spare hard disk ribbon cable and i wanted to be careful in case this didnt word so what i did was purchase a crimp on  pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable

the part cost  again and is easily attached with any good wood vice

the theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesnt work my original cable is not damaged and i can go back to the original setup

having done all that i couldnt be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so i plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day

in a mac ii everything should work the same

be careful with the ids of the drive and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact

i did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if i am splitting the scsi chain that the signal should be terminated at all the ends

let me know if you have any more questions

 sandviknewtonapplecom kent sandvik writes   in article qlcvauxaecnbguedu gsuuxaecnbguedu eric   molas wrote    christianity is an infectious cult

the reasons it flourishes are    because  it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life    a safety blanked to hide behind

oh wowall i have to do is    follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness

    i agree that in many cases primitive emotional feelings based on   haha you wont laugh in hell mentalities makes certain religions   very attractive for certain personalities

  i agree with both of u but i would like to make a small point

xtianity   other dogmatic religions not only attract people without hope etc but  also attract average people as well

i believe that xtainity thru  its escapist doctrines  absolutist attitudes provides great psychological  shelter from daytoday frustrations unhappiness  fear of uncertainty   unknown etc

 this is a good point but i think average people do not take up christianity so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their social life or to get more involved with american culture if they are kids of immigrants for example

since it is the overwhelming major religion in the western world in some form or other it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives but not somethong too new or too out of the ordinary

seems a little weak but as long as it doesnt hurt anybody  the buddha had something to say about the attractiveness of religions   when driven by fear man worships sacred mountains sacred stones  and sacred trees

  however the buddha also said   if somebody finds peace in any religion let him be

  these are good quotes and i agree with both of them but lets make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like let him be as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace

or something like that

of course i suppose if someone were really at peace there would be no need for inflicting evangelism  personally i feel that since religion have such a poweful  psychological effect we should let theists be

but the problem is that  religions cause enormous harm to nonbelievers and to humanity as a whole  holy wars inquisitions interreligious hatred impedence of science   intellectual progress usthem attitudes etc etc

need i say more

 i really dont know what we can do about them

any comments

 well it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives

their popularity seems to come and go

i remember when i first entered high school i was an atheist always had been and so were about  of my friends

at this time  of those  have converted always to christianity they were all also immigrants from taiwan or sons of immigrants hence my earlier gross generalization

christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before since ive been noticing

maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning

who knows

i for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them so long as we have some set of abstract rightsagreements on how we should treat each other i have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions

for all the wellput arguments on this usenet it never does any good

argumentation does not really seem to apply to christians or even some atheists it must simply be a step the person takes naturally almost instinctively best regards   adam john cooper verily often have i laughed at the weaklings   who thought themselves good simply because   acoopermacalstredu they had no claws

    the unenlightened one     buddhism has the characteristics of what would be  tan chade meng  expected in a cosmic religion for the future it  singapore  transcends a personal god avoids dogmas and theology  cmtanissnussg  it covers both the natural  spiritual and it is   based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience   of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful   unity  einstein     

your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable posts

the first i captured was by ken arromdee on  feb  on the subject re atheist too

that was article  here your question was article  which is an average of about  articles a day for the last three years

as others have noted the current posting rate is such that my kill file is depressing large

among the posting i saved in the early days were articles from the following notables hey it might to interesting to read some of these posts

especially from ones who still regularly posts on altatheism

in article aprprincetonedu qpliuphoenixprincetonedu qpliu writes  so while faith itself is a gift obedience is what makes faith possible

what makes obeying different from believing

 i am still wondering how it is that i am to be obedient when i have no idea to whom i am to be obedient

it is all written in thewhollybabbletheusersguidetoinvisible pinkunicorns

to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns you must read the babble and obey what is written in it

to obey what is written in the babble you must believe that doing so is the way to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns

to believe that obeying what is written in the babble leads to believing in invisible pink unicorns you must essentially believe in invisible pink unicorns

this bit of circular reasoning begs the question what makes obeying different from believing

no everything wouldnt be ok but it would be a start

now wait if the religious organizations were no longer taxexempt what other beef could you have

they would then have as much right to lobby as would any other group

you asked would everything be okay

i answered no

everything encompasses more than just the taxexempt status of religious organizations

well if everything wouldnt be okay then tell us what it is that wouldnt be okay

that is if religions were no longer taxexempt then what would be wrong with their lobbying or otherwise attempting to influence politics

geoffarnoldeastsuncom  what if they made the whole thing up

 the great lie by four guys two thousand years ago over wine  the tear garden

i was looking for a rigorous definition because otherwise we would be spending the rest of our lives arguing what a christian really believes

i dont think we need to argue about this

ksdo you think that the motto points out that this country is proud ksof its freedom of religion and that this is something that ksdistinguishes us from many other countries

mwno

kswell your opinion is not shared by most people i gather

perhaps not but that is because those seeking to make government recognize christianity as the dominant religion in this country do not think they are infringing on the rights of others who do not share their beliefs

yes but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their beliefs

and actually i think that the government already does recognize that christianity is the dominant religion in this country

i mean it is

dont you realizerecognize this

this isnt to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of christianity just that most people do

like ive said before i personally dont think the motto is a major concern

if you agree with me then what are we discussing

kssince most people dont seem to associate christmas with jesus much ksanymore i dont see what the problem is

can you prove your assertion that most people in the us dont associate christmas with jesus anymore

no but i hear quite a bit about christmas and little if anything about jesus

wouldnt this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really associated to a high degree with him

or are you saying that the association with jesus is on a personal level and that everyone thinks about it but just never talks about it

that is can you prove that most people do associate christmas most importantly with jesus

anyways the point again is that there are people who do associate christmas with jesus

it doesnt matter if these people are a majority or not

i think the numbers do matter

it takes a majority or at least a majority of those in power to discriminate

doesnt it

an atheist is one who lacks belief in gods yes

if so then   its entirely plausible that an atheist could dig lenin or lennon to   such an extent that it might be considered worship and still be   an atheist

anything else seems to be newspeak

   ask yourself the following question

would you regard an ardent  nazi as a republican simply because germany no longer had a kaiser

  no because thats based on false dichotomy

there are more options  than you present me

and that of course is the point

you cant simply divide the world into atheists and nonatheists on the basis of godbelief

if all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity and have nothing to say about behaviour then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion

but once you start talking about behaviour then someones suscept ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you are  i assume  worried about

and in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and easily led on the other

i would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led

whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point

deletion  in other words if there were gods they would hardly make sense and  it is possible to explain the phenomenon of religion without gods

  the concept is useless and i dont have to introduce new assumptions  in order to show that

 yes i fully agree with that but is it i dont believe gods exist or i believe no gods exist

as mandtbackafinaboabofi mats andtbacka pointed out it all hinges on what you take the word believe to mean

 for me it is a i believe no gods exist and a i dont believe gods exist

in other words i think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless

in ontology one can fairly conclude that when a exist is meaningless a does not exist

under the pragmatic definition of truth a exists is meaningless makes a exist even logically false

a problem with such statements is that one cant disprove a subjective god by definition and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense

the trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all

believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others

deletion  should the faq be clarified to try to pin down this notion of belief

can it

 honestly i dont see the problem

subject re contradictions   then what would it have to do with in the universe

you theists  cannot understand that inside the universe and outside the universe  are two different places

put god outside the universe and you  subtract from it the ability to interact with the inside of the  universe put it inside the universe and you impose the rules of  physics on it

 

god is outside the universe



things outside the universe do not have the ability to interact  with the inside of the universe



therefore god cannot interact inside the universe

  has no basis whatsoever

you seem to have positive knowledge about this

is a corrallary of 

the negation of  would contridict 

  although we do not have a complete model of the physical rules  governing the inside of the universe we expect that there are no  contradictory events likely to destroy the fabric of modern physics

 on the other hand your notion of an omnipotent omniscient and  infinitely benevolent god is not subject to physical laws you  attempt to explain this away by describing it as being outside of  them beyond measurement

to me beyond measurement means it can  have no measurable effect on reality so it cannot interact ergo  your god is irrelevant

 

god is beyond measure



beyond measurement means it can have no measurable effect on  reality



therefore god cannot have a measurable effect on reality

  has no basis whatsoever

  you missed the conspiracy by  step

joseph knew who knocked her up

 he couldnt let it be known that somebody else got ol mary prego

that  wouldnt do well for his popularity in the local circles

so what  happened is that she was feeling guilty he was feeling embarrassed and  they decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise  been the downfall for both

clever indeed

come to think of it 





i  have gained a new respect for the couple

maybe joseph and mary should  receive all of the praise being paid to jesus

lucky for them that the baby didnt have any obvious deformities

i could just see it now mary gets pregnant out of wedlock so to save face she and joseph say that it was god that got her pregnant and then the baby turns out to be deformed or even worse stillborn

if you state that  one of the books in your room is blue i certainly do not need as much  evidence to believe than if you were to claim that there is a two headed  leapard in your bed

 and i dont mean a male lover in a leotard 

 keith  if the issue is what is truth then the consequences of whatever proposition argued is irrelevent

if the issue is what are the consequences if such and such is true then truth is irrelevent

which is it to be

i disagree every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence and support before one can believe it

there are a miriad of factors for each individual

as we are all different we quite obviously require different levels of evidence

as one pointed out ones history is important

while in fussr one may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans

one would need more evidence than if one lived in the united states

the only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the us is if the individual always wear business suits etc

the degree of the effect upon the world and the strength of the claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary

when determining the level of evidence one needs it is most certainly relevent what the consequences of the proposition are

if the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent please explain why one would not accept the electromagnetic force of attraction between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance apart

remember if the consequences of the law are not relevent then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof

if one of the consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of affairs or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law they are irrelevent when theorizing about the truth of the law

given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent including the consequence of selfcontradiction or contradiction with the state of affiars how are we ever able to judge what is true or not let alone find the truth

by the way what is truth

please define before inserting it in the conversation

please explain what truth or truth is

 wow youre quicker to point out heresy than the church in the middle ages

seriously though even the sheiks at alazhar dont claim that the shiites are heretics

most of the accusations and fabrications about shiites come out of saudi arabia from the wahabis

for that matter you should read the original works of the sunni imams imams of the four madhabs

the teacher of at least two of them was imam jafar sadiq the sixth imam of the shiites

although there is plenty of false propaganda floating around about the shiites esp

since the revolution there are also many good works by shiites which present the views and teachings of their school

why make assumptions and allegations like people in this group have done about islam in general about shiites

roger and i have clearly stated our support of the bsa position on the issue specifically that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of the scout oath specifically the promise to live morally straight

 there is really nothing else to discuss

apparently not

in response to his claim that it terrifies gay people not to be able to indoctrinate children to our lifestyle or words to that effect i sent roger a very calm carefullywritten detailed letter explaining simply why the bsa policy does indeed terrify me

i did not use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an answer

thus far i have not received an answer

i can conclude only that roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not worth defending

trying to cloud the issue with comparisons to blacks or other minorities is also meaningless because its like comparing apples to oranges ie people cant control their race but they can control their behavior

in fact thats exactly the point people can control their behavior

because of that fact there is no need for a blanket ban on homosexuals

what else is there to possibly discuss on recscouting on this issue

kcochrannyxcsduedu keith justified and ancient cochran writes keithccocaltechedu keith allan schneider writes kcochrannyxcsduedu keith justified and ancient cochran writes  no if youre going to claim something then it is up to you to prove it

think cold fusion

 well ive provided examples to show that the trend was general and you or others have provided some counterexamples mostly ones surrounding mating practices etc

i dont think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality

and again the mating practices need to be reexamined

so what youre saying is that your mind is made up and youll just explain away any differences at being statistically insignificant

try to find immoral nonmatingrelated activities

so youre excluding matingrelatedactivities from your natural morality

 no but mating practices are a special case

ill have to think about it some more

so youll just explain away any inconsistancies in your theory as being a special case

yes i think that the natural system can be objectively deduced with the goal of species propogation in mind

but i am not equating the two as you so think

that is an objective system isnt necessarily the natural one

are you or are you not the man who wrote a natural moral system is the objective moral system that most animals  follow

 indeed

but while the natural system is objective all objective systems are not the natural one

so the terms can not be equated

the natural system is a subset of the objective ones

you just equated them

reread your own words

now since homosexuality has been observed in most animals including birds and dolphins are you going to claim that most animals have the capacity of being immoral

 i dont claim that homosexuality is immoral

it isnt harmful although it isnt helpful either to the mating process

and when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom dont you mean bisexuality

a study release in  found that  of female seagulls are lesbians

well im saying that these goals are not inherent

that is why they must be postulates because there is not really a way to determine them otherwise although it could be argued that they arise from the natural goalbut they are somewhat removed

postulate to assume posit

 thats right

the goals themselves arent inherent

 i can create a theory with a postulate that the sun revolves around the earth that the moon is actually made of green cheese and the stars are the portions of angels that intrudes into threedimensional reality

 you could but such would contradict observations

now apply this last sentence of your to your theory

notice how your are contridicting observations

i can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that given the length of one side of a triangle the length of a second side of the triangle and the degree of angle connecting them i can determine the length of the third side

 but a postulate is something that is generally or always found to be true

i dont think your postulate would be valid

you dont know much math do you

the ability to use sas to determine the length of the third side of the triangle is fundemental to geometry

guess which one people are going to be more receptive to

in order to assume something about your system you have to be able to show that your postulates work

 yes and i think the goals of survival and happiness do work

you think they dont

or are they not good goals

goals  postulates

again if one of the goals of this objectivenatural morality system you are proposing is survival of the species then homosexuality is immoral

how bout some supreme court justices

one thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news program on a local stationthe promo said something like who are these cults and why do they prey on the young

ahem

ever hear of baptism at birth

if that isnt preying on the young i dont know what is

i used to be ack barf a catholic and was even confirmedshortly thereafter i decided it was a load of bs

my mom who really insisted that i continue to go to church felt it was her duty 

to bring me up as a believer

that was one of the more presumptuous things ive heard in my life

i suggested we go talk to the priest and she agreed

the priest was amazingly cool about ithe basically said that if i didnt believe it there was no good in forcing it on me

actually i guess he wasnt amazingly cool about ithis response is what youd hope for indeed expect from a human being

i spose i just didnt expect it

i find it absurd that religion exists yet i can also see its usefulness to people

facing up to the fact that youre just going to be worm food in a few decades and that there isnt some cosmic purpose to humanity and the universe can be pretty difficult for some people

having a readilyavailable predigested solution to this is pretty attractive if youre either a gullible enough b willing to suspend your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind or c have had the stuff rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember

chris  chris leger sophomore carnegie mellon computer engineering rememberif you dont like what somebody is saying you can always ignore them

 in cases of prostitution both the man and the prostitute would be punished in public quite severely

deletion  no gregg you cannot say a is lenient and a punishes severely in public

unless of course it is one of the exceptions implied by almost all matters

 that depends on the statistics and who is punished in public

if some power for example nothing islamic about it allows men to rape women five times before blowing the rapists head off in public then id call that leniency wouldnt you

 you have given that example

it is not lenient

end of argument

and chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either

it rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system without checking if they suit the description

and wasnt the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman according to islamic law

while i dont approve of it i think both the prostitute and the customer have the right to do what they do

in other words punishing them is a violation of their rights

and to punish them severely in public is just another pointer to the hysteria connected with sexuality in so many religions

 believe what you like

 no i even believe what i dont like

can you give better answers than that

have you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims

in this case i dont see why i should accept the complex ridden views of an oriental goatherd

 ah yes i forget that the west is historically so much without sexual neurosis   oriental goatherd really intellectual

 a fact if memory serves

and most will see the connection between the primitive machism in the orient and in islam

if people agree on having sex it is fine

and i would assume that a god would have a clue of what the detrimental effects of supressing it are

 huh

ever heard of aids

of course youll probably go on to say that god must be evil because he allows the disease to exist bla bla

 as usually you miss the point

aids is neither spread only through sex nor necessarily spread by having sex

futher the point is a very important point the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of aids

it is even stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex

the consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of aids

please note that the idea that everybody would end up with aids when sex is not controlled is completely counterfactual

and since you have brought up the point is your god evil or not

benedikt

my turn i went back and reread your post

all you did is attack atheism and say that agnosticism wasnt as funny as atheism

nowhere does that imply that you are agnostic or weak atheist

as most people who post such inflammatory remarks are theists it was a reasonable assumption

sorry youre right

i did not clearly state it

rule  condescending to the population at large ie theists will not win many people to your faith anytime soon

it only ruins your credibility

how am i being condescending to the population at large

i am stating something that happened to be true for a long time i couldnt believe that people actually believed in this god idea

it was an alien concept to me

i am not trying to win people to my faith as you put it

i have no faith

religion was a non issue when i had the attitude above because it never even occurred to me to believe

atheist by default i guess you could say

the most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude

once one has accepted the assumption that there is no gods and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumptions contradict your assumption then i would say theres a lack of consistency here

now i know youll get on me about faith

if the positive belief that god does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational people have problems with that logic

but you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist

sorry for the flamage

the line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed to imply that

sorry been reading too much on the clipper project lately and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some

 what is the clipper project btw

rule  dont mix apples with oranges

how can you say that the extermination by the mongols was worse than stalin

khan conquered people unsympathetic to his cause

that was atrocious

but stalin killed millions of his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist state

how can anyone be worse than that

many rulers have done similar things in the past only stalin did it when there was plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him

the evidence is that some of the early european rulers ruled with an iron fist much like stalins

you threw in numbers and i am sick of hearing about stalin as an example because the example doesnt apply

you managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack all forms of atheism

it might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons

people will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammersickle

the stalin example is important not only because its still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas even after all that he had wrought

the evidence i am referring to is more a lack of evidence than negative evidence

say i claim there are no pink crows

i have never seen a pink crow but that doesnt mean it couldnt exist

but this person here claims that there are pink crows even though he admits he hasnt been able to capture one or get a photo or find one with me etc

in a sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crows

that is what i am saying when i look at the evidence

i look at the suppossed evidence for a deity show how it is flawed and doesnt show what theists want it to show and go on

first all the pink crowsunicornselves arguments in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy

why

one of the big reasons is that many many people want something beyond this life

you can pretend that they dont want this but i for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes

and there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a god

can love as a truth be proven logically

themselves namely a god or gods

so in principle its hard to see how theists are necessarily arrogant

makes no sense to me

they seem arrogant to make such a claim to me

but my previous refutation still stands and i believe there may be another one on the net

john the baptist boasted of jesus to many people

i find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all

many christians i know also boast in this way but i still do not necessarily see it as arrogance

of course i do know arrogant christians doctors and teachers as well

technically you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant jesus for instance

are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism

if you are talking about weak atheism which i believe in then i refuse such a claim

atheism is a lack of belief

i used good ol occams razor to make the final rejection of a deity in that as i see things even if i present the hypothesises in an equal fasion i find the theist argument not plausible

i speak against strong atheism

i also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective

i believe i answered that

i apologize for the as you stated incorrect assumption on your theism but i saw nothing to indicate that you were an agnostic only that you were just another newbie christian on the net trying to get some cheap shots in

no apology necessary

in article buedu jaegerbuphybuedu gregg jaeger writes judaism for one

maddi has confirmed this for one

and again i reiterate that one can easily leave the religion at any time simply by making a public declaration

if one is too lazy to do that then the religion cannot be held responsible

there are many islamic countries where publically renouncing islam can be quite dangerous

these countries might not according to you necessarily be practicing true islam but the danger still remains one cannot blame failure to publically renounce islam on laziness as opposed to a desire to stay alive and well

of course if youre planning to pull a rushdie then declaring ones leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to ones other plans

in rushdies case the one under discussion one can

it is tragic that in some islamic countries this is so

there are however islamic countries whose constitutions contains statements that islamic law is to be incorporated eg

kuwait where one can freely make such statements without fear

not to mention that it has already been pointed out that rushdie has said in his books that hes not a muslim and there have surely been enough readers of his books to provide the appropriate number of witnesses

this story has become tiresome

the conditions are clear

if you care to make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made public statements about leaving islam prior to his writing of tsv

if he did make such statements then he should have made that clear rather than trying to rejoin islam or go on talking about his personal feelings

khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve islamic leaders the twelve imams who are free of error or sin

this makes him a heretic

in the quran muhammad is chastised for error directly by god the quran says that muhammad is the greatest example of proper islamic behavior thus no muslim is free from error

as usual there seems to be almost as many islamic viewpoints as there are muslims

perhaps it seems so to you but this is hardly the case

there is widespread agreement about matters of islam

there certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly islamic in and of themselves but this is so for any large group of people under the same name

it all comes back to the koran being so imprecise in its wording

the quran is not particularly imprecise in wording though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words

however as an entire text the quran makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them

 in article qiljkjfidoasdsgicom liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes   i hope an islamic bank is something other than bcci which  ripped off so many small depositors among the muslim  community in the uk and elsewhere

  jon

  grow up childish propagandist

gregg im really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice things arent quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim them to be upsets you but exactly who is being childish here is open to question

bbci was an example of an islamically owned and operated bank  what will someone bet me they werent real islamic owners and operators

and yet it actually turned out to be a longrunning and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often quite naive depositors

and why did these naive depositors put their life savings into bcci rather than the nasty interestmotivated western bank down the street

could it be that they believed an islamically owned and operated bank couldnt possibly cheat them

so please dont try to con us into thinking that it will all work out right next time

from mangoecsumdedu charley wingate subject re gospel dating lines  so then you require the same amount of evidence to believe that i a own a pair of bluejeans and b have superhuman powers

well i could use the argument that some here use about nature and claim that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human superhuman powers are beyond what a human has and since you are a human any powers you have are not beyond those of a human

hence you cannot have superhuman powers

sound good to you

anyway to the evidence question it depends on the context

in this group since you are posting from a american college site im willing to take it as given that you have a pair of blue jeans

and assuming there is some coherency in your position i will take it as a given that you do not have superhuman powers

arguments are evidence in themselves in some respects

when you say the existence of  sic  jesus i assume that you mean just the man without any special powers etc

yep

many will agree that it is very possible that a man called jesus did in fact live

in fact i am willing to agree that there was some man named jesus

i have no reason to believe that there wasnt ever a man

good

however most of the claims are extradinary eg virgin birth  virgin in the sense of not having any sexual intercourse  resurection son of god etc

those claims require extra evidence

extra evidence

why dont we start with evidence at all

i cannot see any evidence for the v b which the cynics in this group would ever accept

as for the second it is the foundation of the religion

anyone who claims to have seen the risen jesus back in the  day period is a believer and therefore is discounted by those in this group since these are all ancients anyway one again to choose to dismiss the whole thing

the third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it means so again i dont see how evidence is possible

i thus interpret the extraordinary claims claim as a statement that the speaker will not accept any evidence on the matter

c wingate  the peace of god it is no peace  but strife closed in the sod

mangoecsumdedu  yet brothers pray for but one thing tovemangoe  the marvlous peace of god

i somewhat agree with u

however what it comes to theist religion its a different matter

thats because religion is like a drug once u use it its very difficult to get out of it

thats because in order to experience a religion u necessarily have to have blind faith and once u have the blind faith its very diffcult for you to reason yourself back to atheism again

therefore its unreasonable to ask people to try religion in order to judge it

its like asking people to try dying to find out what death is like

well now we cant judge death until we are dead right

so why should we judge religion without having experienced it

people have said that religion is bad by any account and that it is in no way useful etc but i dont totally agree with this

of course we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it

so basically we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual or even for a general population

we can say that it is not best for us personally at least you can choose not to use religionmight be hard to try to find out its benefits as you state above

keith

let me see if i understand what you are saying

in order to talk knowledgeably about religion atheists must first have been so immersed in a religion that only the rare individual could have left

no you dont understand

i said that i dont think people can discuss the subjective merits of religion objectively

this should be obvious

people here have said that everyone would be better off without religion but this almost certainly isnt true

but really are you threatened by the motto or by the people that use it

the motto is a tool

lets try to take away the tool

but guns and axes are tools both of which have been used for murder

should both be taken away

that is to say i dont think motto misuse warrants its removal

at least not in this case

in article buedu jaegerbuphybuedu gregg jaeger writes a brutal system filtered through leniency is not lenient

huh

how do you rate public floggings or floggings at all

chopping off the hands heads or other body parts

what about stoning

i dont have a problem with floggings particularly when the offenders have been given a chance to change their behavior before floggings are given

i do have a problem with maiming in general by whatever means

in my opinion noone who has not maimed another should be maimed

in the case of rape the victim is maimed physically and emotionally so i wouldnt have a problem with maiming rapists

obviously i wouldnt have a problem with maiming murderers either

may i ask if you had the same opinion before you became a muslim

sure

yes i did

you see i dont think that rape and murder should be dealt with lightly

you being so interested in leniency for leniencys sake apparently think that people should simply be told the did a bad thing

and what about the simple chance of misjudgements

misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible

i suspect that its pretty unlikely that given my requirement of repeated offenses that misjudgments are very likely

orient is not a place having a single character

your ignorance exposes itself nicely here

read carefully i have not said all the orient shows primitive machism

well then why not use more specific words than orient

probably because in your mind there is no need to its all the same

because it contains sufficient information

while more detail is possible it is not necessary

and europe shows civilized bullshit

this is bullshit

time to put out or shut up

youve substantiated nothing and are blabbering on like islamists who talk about the west as the great satan

youre both guilty of stupidities

i just love to compare such lines to the common plea of your fellow believers not to call each others names

in this case to substantiate it the quran allows that one beats ones wife into submission

really

care to give chapter and verse

we could discuss it

primitive machism refers to that

i have misspelt that before my fault

again not all of the orient follows the quran

so youll have to do better than that

sorry you havent put out enough

islam expresses extramarital sex

extramarital sex is a subset of sex

it is suppressedin islam

that marial sexis allowed or encouraged in islam as it is in many branches of christianity too misses the point

read the part about the urge for sex again

religions that run around telling people how to have sex are not my piece of cake for two reasons suppressing a strong urge needs strong measures and it is not their business anyway

believe what you wish

i thought you were trying to make an argument

all i am reading are opinions

it is an argument

that you doubt the validity of the premises does not change it

if you want to criticize it do so

time for you to put up or shut up

this is an argument for why you dont like religions that suppress sex

a such its an irrelevant argument

if youd like to generalize it to an objective statement then fine

my response is then you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion one of your arguments

the urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it

if the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner

gregg

subject re americans and evolution in article culbvdarksideosrheuoknoredu bilokcforumosrheedu bill conner writes    why do you spend so much time posting here if your atheism is so  incidental if the question of god is trivial

fess up it matters to  you a great deal

 ask yourself two questions

  

how important is mithras in your life today

  

how important would mithras become if there was a  well funded group of fanatics trying to get the  schools system to teach your children that mithras  was the one true god

 jon

right on jon

who cares who or whose as long as it works for the individual

but dont try to impose those beliefs on us or our children

i would add the wellfunded group tries also to purge science to deny children access to great wonders and skills

and how about the kids born to creationists

what a burden with which to begin adult life

it must be a cruel awakening for those who finally see the light provided it is possible to escape from the depths of this type of ignorance

from robert knowles ppsilinkcom subject re islam and scientific predictions was inreplyto clfvhrranrlnavymil nntppostinghost  organization kupajava east of krakatoa xmailer psilinkdos 

lines  date fri  apr   gmt from umar khan khanitditdnrlnavymil   his conclusion was that while he was impressed that what little the holy quran had to say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the holy quran did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in the traditions

how would a man of th century arabia have known what not to include in the holy quran assuming he had authored it

 well it looks like the folks in socreligionislam have loosened up a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the bankinginterest topic

a few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned

these may be hard to find but i think i may take a stab at it out of curiosity

i know the one film i saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes i have seen which were used to show science in the koran which i posted here were also pretty vague

i suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have

at least one poster on the islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the koran to decide what is good science

i wonder if islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the christians creation science on any topic

it would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the koran to see if anyone used the koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded

it is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then interpret passages to match those findings

people do similar things with the sayings of nostradamus all the time

anyway it is a rather unique claim of islam and may be worth checking

deletion few people can imagine dying for capitalism a few more can imagine dying for democracy but a lot more will die for their lord and savior jesus christ who died on the cross for their sins

motivation pure and simple

 got any cites for this nonsense

how many people will die for mom

patriotism

freedom

money

their kids

fast cars and swimming pools

a night with kim basinger or mel gibson

and which of these things are evil

 read a history book fred

and tell me why so many religions command to commit genocide when it has got nothing to do with religion

or why so many religions say that not living up to the standards of the religion is worse than dieing

coincidence i assume

or ist part of the absolute morality you describe so often

theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes

irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism

benedikt

 first i want to start right out and say that im a christian

it thats okay its what all the rest of them who come on here say  makes sense to be one

have any of you read tony campollos book liar  lunatic or the real thing

i might be a little off on the title but he  writes the book

anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity  in the process he became a christian himself

this isnt the guy who was a lawyer was he

could you give more info on this guy never mind im sure there will be plenty of responses to this post and it will appear there  the arguements he uses i am summing up

the book is about whether  jesus was god or not

i know many of you dont believe but listen to a  different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what  others have to say

this is true

make sure it is true for all cases

 the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a why not both

  modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was

 some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows

who would  die for a lie

wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar

why not die for a lie

if you were poverty stricken and alunatic sounds perfecetly reasoable to me

as to whether the societal dregs he had for followers would be able to tell if he was a liar or not not necessarily

even if he died for what he believed in this still makes him completely selfish

like us all

so whats the difference

people  gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing  someone who was or had been healed

call me a fool but i believe he did  heal people

there is no historical proof of this see earlier threads

besides he or at least his name have been the cause of enough deaths to make up for whatever healing he gave

 niether was he a lunatic

would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy

sieg heil

very doubtful in fact rediculous

for example  anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see  this right away

 who is david koresh

i am curious

therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the  real thing

how does this follow

your definition of lunatic and disproof thereof seem rather uhhh

shaky  some other things to note

he fulfilled loads of prophecies in  the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone

this in his betrayal  and crucifixion

i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i  write i will use it

good idea

 i dont think most people understand what a christian is

it  is certainly not what i see a lot in churches

naturally those or not true christians right

  rather i think it  should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for gods  sake

he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  same

hey we cant do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives  over to him

thats tuff and most people dont want to do it to be a  real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at

but  just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes  time

we dont rush it in one day christianity is your whole life

 it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in  a while

we box everything into time units

such as work at this  time sports tv social life

god is above these boxes and should be  carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ourselves

someone else handle this i dont know if its worth it sigh   adam john cooper verily often have i laughed at the weaklings   who thought themselves good simply because   acoopermacalstredu they had no claws

 what about the twelve imams who he considered incapable of error  or sin

khomeini supports this view of the twelve imans

this is  heresy for the very reasons i gave above

i would be happy to discuss the issue of the  imams with you although my preference would be to move the discussion to another newsgroup

i feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate

i think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view as ive articulated it above which may not be the true view of khomeini is from the basic principles of islam

so that the nonmuslim readers of this group will see how far from the simple basics of islam such views are on the face of them

and if they are not in contradiction with the basics of islam how subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in islam while they are explicitly proscribed by the quran

the topic is deeply embedded in the world view of islam and the esoteric teachings of the prophet sa heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally if at all concerned with the metaphysical substance of mans being and nature

in my opinion considering any human being as having a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being is a heretical notion and one proscribed by islam

from your posts you seem fairly well versed in sunni thought

you should seek to know shiite thought through knowledgeable shiite authors as well  at least that much respect is due before the charge of heresy is levelled

absolutely

i would be interested in discussing this privately and i am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of errorfree and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the quran

however prima facie such attemptsa are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery explicitly proscribed by the quran

as salaam alaikum alaikum wassalam gregg

stuff deleted  what we should be demanding is for khomeini and his ilk to publicly  come clean and to show their proof that islamic law punishes  apostacy with death or that it tolerates any similar form of  coversion of freedom of conscience

all five schools of law to the best of my knowledge support the death sentence for apostasy when it is accompanied by open persistent and aggravated hostility to islam

otherwise i agree there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief

the quran makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience

public or private disavowal of islam or conversion to another faith is not punishable there are some jurists who have gone against this trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable even by death  but historically they are the exception

cursing and insulting the prophets falls under the category of shatim

  i just borrowed a book from the library on khomeinis fatwa etc

lots of stuff deleted   and according to the above analysis it looks like khomeinis offering  of a reward for rushdies death in fact constitutes a criminal act  according to islamic law

please see my post under re yet more rushdie islamic law

 in the absence of some convincing evidence that theist fanatics are more dangerous than atheist fanatics ill continue to be wary of fanatics of any stripe

 i think that the agnostic fanatics are the most dangerous of the lot

 fair point actually

i mentioned theists and atheists but left out agnostics

mea culpa

 no wonder in the light of that you are a probably a theist who tries to pass as an agnostic

i still remember your post about your daughter singing chrismas carols and your feelings of it well

by the way would you show marginal honesty and answer the many questions you left open when you ceased to respond last time

benedikt

in article badaidbsturztubsde idbsturztubsde benedikt rosenau writes  but could you give a definition of free will

especially in the  presence of an omniscient being

will is selfdetermination

in other words god created conscious beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently of god

all will therefore is free will

so these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of their circumstances their genetics their environment their experiences which are not all selfdetermined

of course the idea of hell makes the idea of free will dubious

on the other hand the idea of hell is not a very powerful idea

a parable for you there was once our main character who blah blah blah

one day a thug pointed a mean looking gun at omc and said do what i say or im blasting you to hell

omc thought if i believe this thug and follow the instructions that will be given ill avoid getting blasted to hell

on the other hand if i believe this thug and do not follow the instructions that will be given ill get blasted to hell

hmm the more attractive choice is obvious ill follow the instructions

now omc found the choice obvious because everything omc had learned about getting blasted to hell made it appear very undesirable

but then omc noticed that the thugs gun wasnt a real gun

the thugs threats were make believe

so omc ignored the thug and resumed blah blah blah

 liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes   so you are saying that it isnt possible for an instinctive act  to be moral one

   i like to think that many things are possible

explain to me  how instinctive acts can be moral acts and i am happy to listen

  for example if it were instinctive not to murder then not murdering would have no moral significance since there would be nothing voluntary about it

  that is in order for an act to be an act of morality  the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard  it

   weaker than that

there must be the possibility that the  organism  its not just people we are talking about  can  consider alternatives

  so only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other  beings mimics theirs

you are starting to get the point

mimicry is not necessarily the same as the action being imitated

a parrot saying pretty polly isnt necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly

 and how much emphasis do you place on intelligence

see above

 animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but  they dont

they do

i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this but you seem to have a very short memory

 are you trying to say that this isnt an act of morality because  most animals arent intelligent enough to think like we do

im saying there must be the possibility that the organism  its not just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives

its right there in the posting you are replying to

gregg jaeger jaegerbuphybuedu wrote well it seemed slightly incongruous to find the union jack flying at city hall in belfast

may i ask why

its there not because the british want it there ni is just one big expensive problem its there because that is what the majority of the population of ni want

is there some problem with that

the majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps

there seems quite alot of incentive for the british to have control of ni like using the north channel and irish sea as a waste dump i was appalled at the dumping i saw in the harbor in belfast

it is my understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water  itd be quite a problem if ni got its independence from britain and then stopped accepting the waste

in allahs infinite wisdom the universe was created from nothing just by saying be and it became

therefore allah exists

bobby mozumder proving the existence of allah  wait

you just said that humans are rarely reasonable

doesnt that contradict atheism where everything is explained through logic and reason

this is the contradiction in atheism that proves it false

bobby mozumder proving the existence of allah  plus to the believer it would be contradictory to the quran for allah not to exist

well its obvious that you dont attempt otherwise you would be aware that they dont all loudly claim to be the one true christian

ive tried to avoid using the phrase isis not christian because of these ownership issues instead ive tried the phrase nicene christianity in an attempt to identify the vast majority of christianity which has roughly similar viewpoints on the core theological issues

 arromdeejyusenkyoucsjhuedu ken arromdee writes   look im not the one that made those nazi comparisons

other people  compared what the religious people are doing now to nazi germany

they  have said that it started out with little things but no one really knew  about any of these little things strangely enough and grew to bigger  things

they said that the motto is but one of the little things  you just contradicted yourself

the motto is one of those little things that  nobody has bothered mentiopning to you huh

  the little things above were in reference to germany clearly

people  said that there were similar things in germany but no one could name any

 they said that these were things that everyone should know and that they  werent going to waste their time repeating them

sounds to me like no one  knew either

i looked in some books but to no avail

thats not true

i gave you two examples

one was the rather pevasive antisemitism in german christianity well before hitler arrived

the other was the system of social ranks that were used in imperail germany and austria to distinguish jews from the rest of the population

neither of these were very terrible in themselves but both helped to set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of jews was made easier

jon

attempting to define objective morality  ill take a wild guess and say freedom is objectively valuable

i base  this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly  of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition  almost all would want to complain

so long as you keep that almost in there freedom will be a mostly valuable thing to most people

that is i think youre really saying a real big lot of people agree freedom is subjectively valuable to them

thats good and a quite nice starting point for a moral system but its not universal and thus not objective

 therefore i take it that to assert or  believe that freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see  that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on  a rainy day

it isnt in sahara

from sandviknewtonapplecom kent sandvik subject re islamic genocide organization cookamunga tourist bureau lines   ok so pick former yugoslavia instead and say their problems are caused  by communism it doesnt really matter

but i guess religious leaders are  calling for an end to that too so it cant be religiously motivated

this  despite the fact that the christians carve crosses in dead muslims chests

 maybe they just want land

maybe its something else they want

maybe the  cross carvings are just accidental

i dont know

just looks suspicious

most likely the tragic situation in bosnia is a combination of ethnical and religious motives where religion is just one attribute that separates the groups from each other

but i must agree that the sad saga in bosnia is a terrible example of a case where religion is not helping instead it is used as a weapon against other humans

and my sympathies are mostly on the bosnian side it looks like the serbs are the oppressors willing to use even christianity as a weapon against their former friends

an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature  exclusively

there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything

there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc

 everything is random nothing is determnined

this posts contains too many fallacies to respond too

the abolishment of divinity requires the elimination of freewill

you have not shown this

you have not even attempted to

the third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it means so again i dont see how evidence is possible

 no cookies charlie

the claims that jesus have been seen are discredited as extraordinary claims that dont match their evidence

in this case it is for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was jesus who has been seen

further there are zillions of other spook stories and one would hardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of a resurrection

there have been more elaborate arguments made but it looks as if they have not passed your post filtering

i thus interpret the extraordinary claims claim as a statement that the speaker will not accept any evidence on the matter

it is no evidence in the strict meaning

if there was actual evidence it would probably be part of it but the says nothing about the claims

charlie i have seen invisible pink unicorns

by your standards we have evidence for ipus now

subject re biblical rape deletion  the thread biblical rape was initiated by david o hunt

here is his posting in article feukoxsfkpcpandrewcmuedu david o hunt bluelobstercmuedu writes  im pretty sure ive seen biblical rules for when its allowable to rape  prisoners what the codes are about that etc

could some more  knowledgable soul than i please let me know some references

 he asked a very narrow question and i gave a very narrow answer

 yes sorry

i have got that wrong

my apology

deletion no

david hunts post didnt mention a god nor did my response

you were the first to bring up the idea of the bible being given by god

most jews dont believe this in any literal sense

 so

no fun but i must have met the minority then

and given by god refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something

rob i am not intimate with jewish theology but i understand that you are a messianic jew

correct me if i am wrong but it appears that the views of messianic jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of jews

while jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the christianic god views i have heard that it is possible for jews to attribute evil to their god an nono for christians the bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man

deletion no

i thought we agreed that though jews disagree there are a set of core beliefs that they do agree upon one of which is that the commandments are accessible and written in the language of the time and another of which is that there must be a legal system to update them

 the context was metaphysics even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion

i wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system

deletion could you explain this with respect to the original commandments being discussed  that is the commandment that says if you feel like raping a woman prisoner you should instead wait and marry her

what about the way this commandment is given invalidates it

 is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds

the context is repulsive and it is foul play imo to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book

big deletion   the point is that i see that there is a necessary connection  between the theology you use and the interpretation of the bible

  only very loosely

my interpretation of the bible is based on a long tradition of jewish scholars interpreting the bible

theology doesnt really enter into it  there are jewish atheists who interpret the laws of charity essentially the same way i do

 no not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation of the bible

as in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god

the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god whatever that means that alone is a theo logic question is proof of a theology used

 you pose another metaphysical riddle

  no you do

  well you wrote this  fine

so we have some major spirit with neither absolute power  nor absolute knowledge

and as it appears limited means or will  to communicate with us

some form of spiritual big friend

 do you admit that using god in this context is somewhat unusual

  am i right in the assumption that it cannot have created the  universe as well

and that the passages in the bible referring  to that or its omnipotence are crap

 thats what i meant by the riddle

 it is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha means

either there is some connection between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of it or it is purely arbitrary further the question is why is has one to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better

you might answer that one cant becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lost but that holds true of every other book and the question remains why has the bible still a special place

cant it be replaced somehow

is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some other message that is included as well

deletion  do you see the danger in doing so

especially with the metaphers used  in the bible

 i think the danger of doing so is less than either the danger of having a frozen system of laws or having no laws

 sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system

deletion if we read two stories about the importance of helping the poor and in one god is a spirit and in the other god has a body which is more important helping the poor or resolving the contradiction about the corporeal nature of god

 if we read two stories in the bible one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly what is more important to resolve the message that children are to be killed or if it has to be done by god

and the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it can be crucial in other questions

religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god

one cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what is good depends on the question

so shes married to joseph

she gets knocked up

what do you think ol joe will do if he finds shes been getting around

so mary comes up with this ridiculous story about god making her pregnant

actually it cant be all that ridiculous considering the number of people that believe it

anyway she never tells anyone the truth and even tells poor little jesus that hes hot shit the son of god

everyone else tells him this too since theyve bought marys story

so what does mary actually turn out to be

an adultress and a liar and the cause of mankinds greatest folly just my recentlyminted two cents

chris  chris leger sophomore carnegie mellon computer engineering rememberif you dont like what somebody is saying you can always ignore them

  yes but fortunately religions have been replaced by systems that value human rights higher

secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life islam places the rights of society and every member in it above the rights of the individual this is what i call true human rights

 by the way do you actually support the claim of precedence of islamic law

in case you do what about the laws of other religions

as a muslim living in a nonmuslim land i am bound by the laws of the land i live in but i do not disregard islamic law it still remains a part of my life

if the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent that i am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then i must leave the land

so in a way islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too

in an islamic state one ruled by a khaliphate religions other than islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they dont affect the genral population and dont come into direct conflict with state laws dhimmis nonmuslim population are exempt from most islamic laws on religion such as fighting in a jihad giving zakat alms giving etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as military protection and if they are poor they will receive zakat

 if not what has it got to do with rushdie

and has anyone reliable information if he hadnt left islam according to islamic law

or is the burden of proof on him

 benedikt after the fatwa didnt rushdie reaffirm his faith in islam didnt he go thru a very public conversion to islam

if so he is binding himself to islamic laws

he has to publicly renounce in his belief in islam so the burden is on him

how is omnipotence contradictory

  by definition all that can occur in the universe is governed by the rules  of nature

thus god cannot break them

anything that god does must be allowed  in the rules somewhere

therefore omnipotence cannot exist

it contradicts  the rules of nature

  obviously an omnipotent god can change the rules

when you say by definition what exactly is being defined certainly not omnipotence

you seem to be saying that the rules of nature are preexistant somehow that they not only define nature but actually cause it

in turn my father has helped with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more fortunate in the community

 liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes   in another part of this thread youve been telling us that the  goal of a natural morality is what animals do to survive

  thats right

humans have gone somewhat beyond this though

perhaps  our goal is one of selfactualization

humans have gone somewhat beyond what exactly

in one thread youre telling us that natural morality is what animals do to survive and in this thread you are claiming that an omniscient being can definitely say what is right and what is wrong

so what does this omniscient being use for a criterion

the long term survival of the human species or what

how does omniscient map into definitely being able to assign right and wrong to actions

  but suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long  term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some  other species either terrestrial or alien

  now you are letting an omniscient being give information to me

this  was not part of the original premise

well your original premises have a habit of changing over time so perhaps youd like to review it for us and tell us what the difference is between an omniscient being be able to assign right and wrong to actions and telling us the result is

  does that make it moral to do so

  which type of morality are you talking about

in a natural sense it  is not at all immoral to harm another species as long as it doesnt  adversely affect your own i guess

im talking about the morality introduced by you which was going to be implemented by this omniscient being that can definitely assign right and wrong to actions

you tell us what type of morality that is

jon

what do you base your belief on atheism on

your knowledge and reasoning

couldnt that be wrong

 actually my atheism is based on ignorance

ignorance of the existence of any god

dont fall into the atheists dont believe because of their pride mistake

 bob beauchaine bobbeviceicotekcom they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea



much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this is probably the wrong group for it

the only relevance here is that you dont seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is murder

that is when you tell us murder is wrong you are using a term you have not yet defined

well ive said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder

however who is at blame is another question

it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risksis to blame

there is a probability of killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital punishment

so when you do either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or later result in the killing of an innocent person

yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity

presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this

and driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do both

driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by courts

they are risks that we take upon ourselves willingly

and i argue that our law system is a similar risk

perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this

in fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents

if our own driving kills someone else then sure there is a moral issue

i know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards

but such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road

again the blame is on society

no im not

this is what you said

you were saying that if there were such a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed  it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing

no i just commented that the state does the killing

it does not depend on there being false witnesses

how could it

the state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes yes but the state is not at fault in such a case

the state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses

it is possible

so what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating the system

im saying capital punishment is murder period

not because of this that and the other but because it involves taking human life

thats my definition of murder

i make no appeals to dictionaries or to objective morals

okay so this is what you call murder

but the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong

are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances

if we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral consequences

we should not play word games and pretend that murder isnt murder

and thats my opinion about how society ought to be run

but this is basically how it works

society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution

and every member of society shares this blame

and most peoples definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it

but we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its possibilty

what ramifications does your personal system have on an objective one

no we were not discussing an objective moral system

i was showing you that you didnt have one because for one thing you were incapable of defining the terms in it for example murder

murder violates the golden rule

executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is

were not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the truth

yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court systems work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a reasonable doubt

sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately

here is what you said  and since we are looking totally objectively at this case  then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to  execute the person or not

if the intent is malicious and  unfair then the execution would be murder

what you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite different

the jury being persuaded beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond a serious doubt

reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not

but in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth

that is twelve members must be convinced of a truth

moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and i would laugh at

but then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair

but would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds

if we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth

its not a question of fairness

your claim which i have quoted above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder

yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we cant always determine the difference in our flawed system

i think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isnt objectively perfect

you see it doesnt matter if we know it is fair or not

objectively it is either fair or it is not

now theres a huge difference

if we can read minds we can know and if we cannot read minds we can know nothing

the difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know

but what we know has no effect on an objective system

i think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are clear on which goals it is supposed to promote

im not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that i am pretty sure does not exist

why are you so sure

i simply want people to confront reality

my reality remember

why is your reality important

in this case the reality is that ideal theories apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system

for every innocent person released from death row there may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or none at all

we simply dont know

but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely

and you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system

now what are we going to do

on the one hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theory and that we can know things we can never know and the justie system is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go on our way

well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal

we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible

on the other hand we can recognize that all justice has a small  we hope  probability of punishing the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up and then say well here we go murdering again

maybe some of us will even say gee i wonder if all this is strictly necessary

yes we all bear the responsibility

most people seem willing to do this

i think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word games

we must realize the consequences of all our actions

why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack

and lest i forget i also dont think we have an objective moral system and i believe i only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of it

i dont think our country has an objective system but i think such an objective system can exist in theory

without omniscience an objective system is not possible in practice

keith

various quotes deleted in the interest of saving a little bit of bandwidth but i will copy the koran quote and it is he god almighty who created the night and the day and the sun and the earth all the celetial bodies swim along each in its rounded course

holy quran  as it has been pointed out this quote makes no claim about what orbits what

the idea that something orbited something had been held as true for many years before the koran was written so the fact that it says something orbits something is hardly surprising insight

my concern is with the word rounded

there are two interpretations of this word 

it means in a circle

this is wrong although many believed it to be true at the time the koran was written

in other words it is not describing our neighborhood of the universe as it really exists but as it was thought to be at the time

this has implications which i hope are obvious to everyone



it means in a rounded shape which could include elipses the geometrical form which most nearly describes the orbits of the planets

this is also not a great insight

look at the shapes you see in nature

very few of them even approach a square or rectangle those are humancreated shapes

everything in nature is rounded to some degree

even the flatearthers dont try to claim earth is a rectangle

children who draw imaginary animals seldom give them rectangular bodies

we seem to instinctively recognize that nature produces rounded shapes hence the assumption that the orbits of the planets would be round hardly takes divine inspiration

it is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation so as you point out below one must really go back to the original arabic

regarding the verses relevant to nature i prefer to use dr maurice bucailles translations in his book the bible the quran and science for in general his translations are more literal

maurice bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion

also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted by you above is the translators interpolation  it is not existent in the original arabic which is why it is included in brackets

perhaps someone who can read the original arabic can eliminate one of these interpretations at any rate neither one of them is exactly impressive

youre right what the verses do contain isnt all that remarkable

however dr bucaille a surgeon thats how hes a dr thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the th century 

or so

and this goes for the rest of the quran as well which has about  verses or so regarding nature i think i remember reading once

i suppose if you believe that you could reason that no one has ever been killed in the name of religion

what a perfect world you live in bobby

one of the reasons that you are atheist is that you limit god by giving god a form

god does not have a face

bobby is referring to a rather obscure law in the good atheists handbook law xxvia

 give that which you do not believe in a face

you must excuse us bobby

when we argue against theism we usually argue against the christian idea of god

in the realm of christianity man was created in gods image

subject re islamic authority over women  thats your mistake

it would be better for the children if the mother raised the child

one thing that relates is among navy men that get tatoos that say mom because of the love of their mom

it makes for more virile men

compare that with how homos are raised

do a study and you will get my point

but in no way do you have a claim that it would be better if the men stayed home and raised the child

that is something false made up by feminists that seek a status above men

you do not recognize the fact that men and women have natural differences

not just physically but mentally also

 your logic

i didnt say americans were the cause of worlds problems i said atheists

 becuase they have no code of ethics to follow which means that atheists can do whatever they want which they feel is right

something totally based on their feelings and those feelings cloud their rational thinking

 yeah

i didnt say that all atheists are bad but that they could be bad or good with nothing to define bad or good

sorry to insult your homestate but coming from where i do wisconsin is very backwards

i was never able to understand that people actually held such bigoted and backwards views until i came here

i have never been to wisconsin though i have been to neighbor minnesota

being a child of the middle atlantic ny nj pa i found that there were few states in the provences that stood out in this youngsters mind california texas and florida to name the most obvious three

however both minnesota and wisconsin stuck out solely on the basis of their politics

both have always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states

and my recent trip to minnestoa last summer served to support that states reputation

my guess is that wisconsin is probably the same

at least that was the impression the people of minnesota left with me about their neighbors

the only question in my head about wisconsin though is whether or not there is a causeeffect relationship between cheese and serial killers  jim halat

deletion you also saidwhy did millions suffer for what adam and ee did

seems a pretty sick way of going about creating a universe  im gonna respond by giving a small theology lessonforgive me i used to be a theology major

first of all i believe that this planet is involved in a cosmic struggle the great controversy betweed christ and satan i borrowed a book title

god has to consider the interests of the entire universe when making decisions

deletion an universe it has created

by the way can you tell me why it is less tyrannic to let one of ones own creatures do what it likes to others

by your definitions your god has created satan with full knowledge what would happen  including every choice of satan

can you explain us what free will is and how it goes along with omniscience

didnt your god know everything that would happen even before it created the world

why is it concerned about being a tyrant when noone would care if everything was fine for them

that the whole idea comes from the possibility to abuse power something your god introduced according to your description

by the way are you sure that you have read the faq

especially the part about preaching

mccullousnakecswiscedu mark mccullough writes  question  this attitude god character seems awfully egotistical and proud

but christianity tells people to be humble

whats the deal

 well god pretty much has a right to be egotistical and proud

i mean he created you doesnt he have the right to be proud of such a job

 of course people dont have much of a right to be proud

what have they accomplished that can match gods accomplishments anyways

how do their abilities compare with those of gods

were an imbecile worm of the earth to quote pascal

grumblegrumble if you were god and you created a universe wouldnt you be just a little irked if some selforganizing cell globules on a tiny planet started thinking they were as great and awesome as you

unfortunately the logic falls apart quick allperfect  insulted or threatened by the actions of a lesser creature  actually by offspring  

howwhy shuold any allpowerful allperfect feel either proud or offended

anything capable of being aware of the relationship of every aspect of every particle in the universe during every moment of time simultaneously should be able to understand the cause of every action of every cell globule on each tniy planet well actually now that i think of it it seems kinda odd that god would care at all about the earth

ok so it was a bad example

but the amazing fact is that he does care apparently and that he was willing to make some grand sacrifices to ensure our happiness

allpowerful owner of everything in the universe makes great sacrifices makes a great headline but it doesnt make any sense

what did he sacrifice

where did it go that he couldnt get it back

if he gave something up whod he give it up to

 i dont see anything special about theism in general that makes it a particular hazard more so than say stupidity anarchy or patriotism

of course it depends on the religion but i see nothing about believing in gods that in and of itself entails or even promotes xenophobia genocide etc

if the emphasis is on the in general then of course youre correct since you havent really said anything

if we restrict our observations to practiced religions there are lots of examples of god mandated genocide

just ask the canaanites

the point is that if you believe in a god and if you believe he has ordered you to eliminate an entire race you will likely make the attempt

after all if it was ok in the past it could surely be ok in the present

 liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes   explain to me  how instinctive acts can be moral acts and i am happy to listen

 for example if it were instinctive not to murder    then not murdering would have no moral significance since there  would be nothing voluntary about it

  see there you go again saying that a moral act is only significant  if it is voluntary

why do you think this

if you force me to do something am i morally responsible for it

  and anyway humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts

well make up your mind

is it to be instinctive not to murder or not

  so only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other  beings mimics theirs

   you are starting to get the point

mimicry is not necessarily the  same as the action being imitated

a parrot saying pretty polly  isnt necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly

  you are attaching too many things to the term moral i think

 lets try this is it good that animals of the same species  dont kill each other

or do you think this is right

its not even correct

animals of the same species do kill one another

  or do you think that animals are machines and that nothing they do  is either right nor wrong

sigh

i wonder how many times we have been round this loop

i think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance

i am quite prepared to believe that higher animals such as primates have the beginnings of a moral sense since they seem to exhibit selfawareness

   animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but  they dont

   they do

i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly  this but you seem to have a very short memory

  those werent arbitrary killings

they were slayings related to some  sort of mating ritual or whatnot

so what

are you trying to say that some killing in animals has a moral significance and some does not

is this your natural morality   are you trying to say that this isnt an act of morality because  most animals arent intelligent enough to think like we do

   im saying   there must be the possibility that the organism  its not   just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives

   its right there in the posting you are replying to

  yes it was but i still dont understand your distinctions

what  do you mean by consider

can a small child be moral

how about  a gorilla

a dolphin

a platypus

where is the line drawn

does  the being need to be self aware

are you blind

what do you think that this sentence means

there must be the possibility that the organism  its not just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives

what would that imply

  what do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of  the same species from arbitrarily killing each other

dont  you find the fact that they dont at all significant

i find the fact that they do to be significant

  leonard ill give you an example of this   my father recently bought a business the business price was  pounds  and my father approached the people in the community for help he raised   pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and  muslims he knew  had cash and the rest he got a business loan after  paying off the muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans  to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest this  is an example of a muslim community helping one another why did they help  because of their common identity as muslims

in turn my father has helped  with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay  and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more  fortunate in the community

sorry

wrong

this is how banks got started in the first place

sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone who eventually goes broke and then they will realise that they havnt been managing risk very well

then they will ask themselves what it is that they need to quantify risk and to persuade borrowers not to take on greater loans than they can carry

and since they dont all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the money some of them will specialise in that

then theyll reinvent interest but like good muslims theyll call it something else

  the fact is leonard it does work without a fluffy bunny in sight

 ithat is the beauty of islam

riiiight

thats why john major opened a new government department a couple of months ago to help to promote minority business

because they can do it all themselves by lending one another cups of sugar

jon

well john has a quite different not necessarily more elaborated theology

there is some evidence that he must have known luke and that the content of q was known to him but not in a canonized form

 this is a new argument to me

could you elaborate a little

 the argument goes as follows qoid quotes appear in john but not in the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke

however they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and not an entirely different source

assuming that he knew luke would obviously put him after luke and would give evidence for the latter assumption

 i dont think this follows

if you take the most traditional attributions then luke might have known john but john is an elder figure in either case

were talking spans of time here which are well within the range of lifetimes

we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors

the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages

it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark

as it is assumed that john knew the content of lukes text

the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly

 earlier manuscripts of john have been discovered

 interesting where and which

how are they dated

how old are they

 unfortunately i havent got the info at hand

it was i think in the late s or early s and it was possibly as old as ce 

 when they are from about  why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three

i dont see your point it is exactly what james felder said

they had no first hand knowledge of the events and it obvious that at least two of them used older texts as the base of their account

and even the association of luke to paul or mark to peter are not generally accepted

 well a genuine letter of peter would be close enough wouldnt it

 sure an original together with id card of sender and receiver would be fine

so whats that supposed to say

am i missing something

and i dont think a one step removed source is that bad

if luke and mark and matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then i really cannot believe in the sort of big transformation from jesus to gospel that some people posit

in news reports one generally gets no better information than this

 and if john is a diciple then theres nothing more to be said

 that john was a disciple is not generally accepted

the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument

the argument that john was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of john itself

is there any other evidence for it

one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times

compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies

not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources

it is also obvious that mark has been edited

how old are the oldest manuscripts

to my knowledge which can be antiquated the oldest is quite after any of these estimates and it is not even complete

 the only clear editing is problem of the ending and its basically a hopeless mess

the oldest versions give a strong sense of incompleteness to the point where the shortest versions seem to break off in midsentence

the most obvious solution is that at some point part of the text was lost

the material from verse  on is pretty clearly later and seems to represent a synopsys of the end of luke

 in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak

but how is that connected to a redating of john

subject omnipotence was re speculations date fri  apr    from nanci ann miller nmwandrewcmuedu     

can god uncreate itself

  no

for if he did he would violate his own nature which he cannot do

 it is gods nature to exist

he is after all the i am which is  a statement of his inherent existence

he is existence itself

 existence cannot notexist

 then as mentioned above he must not be very omnipotent

 what do you mean by omnipotent here

do you mean by omnipotent that god should be able to do anythingeverything

this creates a selfcontradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless

to be descriptive omnipotence must mean being allpowerful and not being able to do anythingeverything

let me illustrate by analogy

suppose the united states were the only nuclear power on earth

suppose further that the us military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations

the us has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the us see fit

the us would be militarily omnipotent

but suppose further that the us holds to a doctrinephilosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation such as the current civil war in the former yugoslavian states

technically in this scenario the us would have the power to unilaterally go into yugoslavia and straighten out the mess

but effectively the us could not intervene without violating its own policy of noninterference

if the policy of noninterference were held to strongly enough then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated

effectively the us would be limited in what it could actually do although it had the power to do whatever it wanted

the us would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate noninterference policy

god is effectively limited in the same sense

he is all powerful but he cannot use his power in a way that would violate the essence of what he himself is

i hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence

  sorry but there are no supernatural   forces necessary to create a pathogen

you are saying since   diseases are bad the bad entity must have created it

so   what would you say about acid rain meteors falling from the   sky volcanoes earthquakes and other quote unquote acts   of god

  i would say that they are not acts of god but natural  occurrences

it amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not the result of the natural process of evolution but rather an act of god and then in the same post say that these other processes volcanos et al

are natural occurrences

who gave you the right to choose what things are natural processes and what are direct acts of god

how do you know that god doesnt cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose in mind

it would certainly go along with the sadistic nature ive seen in the bible

 even if satan had nothing to do with the original inception of  disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since  humanity forsook gods protection

if we choose to live apart from  gods law humanity collectively then it should come as no surprise  that there are adverse consequences to our collective action

one  of these is that we are left to deal with disease and disorders which  inevitably result in an entropic universe

    may i ask where is this collective bullcrap coming from

  by collective i was referring to the idea that god works with  humanity on two levels individually and collectively

if mankind  as a whole decides to undertake a certain action the majority of  mankind then god will allow the consequences of that action to  affect mankind as a whole

adam  eve two people even tho they had the honor or so you christians claim of being the first two definitely do not represent a majority in the billions and trillions probably more of people that have come after them

perhaps they were the majority then but i and you werent around to vote and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to do with that tree

but your god never asked us

he just assumes that if you have two bad people then they all must be bad

last night while watching the am rebroadcast of jerry springer a talk show i heard this jewel of a thought from a  year old racist

the focus of this show was on these kids and their hatred for the jewish religion and why

some stuff deleted interesting and scary no

they went on to say how the jews had killed their god and how in the end of time that all the races would go to their homelands of course they would remain in america which is new jeruselem as it says in gen 

what another kid said but the rest of the races would go home and then the great battle or plague or whatever revel

says would happen and the jews would be killed

 the most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is catholic and had the kjv of the bible on his desk

he immediatly opened it up and began to search for the quoted passages gen rev and john to look for himself and couldnt find what they said they saw

i dont know i saw this show a while back and when i heard these kids quote the bible to justify their racist claims i looked up that quote about jesus hating jews since jesus himself was a jew my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim

the jist of the passage and i am sorry but i cant recall which passage it was exactly was that jesus was condemning the pharisees for being corrupt

of course the pharisees were jewish too but it wasnt jews as a whole that jesus was condemning just the powers that be

   wait a minute

you said never play a chamberlain

since the us  is playing chamberlain as far as east timor is concerned wouldnt  that lead you to think that your argument is irrelevant and had nothing  to do with the gulf war

actually i rather like your idea

perhaps  the rest of the world should have bombed or maybe missiled washington  when the us invaded nicaragua grenada panama vietnam mexico hawaii  or any number of other places

wait a minute doug

i know you are better informed than that

the us has never invaded nicaragua as far as i know

we liberated grenada from the cubans to protect us citizens there and to prevent the completion of a strategic air strip

panama we invaded true twice this century

vietnam

we were invited in by the government of s vietnam

i guess we invaded saudi arabia during the gulf war eh

mexico

we have invaded mexico  or  times once this century but there were no missiles for anyone to shoot over here at that time

hawaii

we liberated it from spain

so if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where we cross someones border you are right  out of 

but normally invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation

if some nation invades the us virgin islands would they be invading the virgin islands or the us

so from this point of view your score falls to  out of  mexico panama

   whats a peacenik

is that somebody who doesnt masturbate  over gunsnammo or what

is it supposed to be bad to be a peacenik

no its someone who believes in peaceatallcosts

and one who would allow hitler to wipe all all jews slavs and political dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone

is it supposed to be bad to be a peacenik you ask

well it depends on what your values are

if you value life over liberty peace over freedom then i guess not

but if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself if youd rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrants heel then yes its bad to be a peacenik

the problem with most peaceniks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be bad and unconscionable

i would not have any argument or problem with a peacenik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues especially those dealing with the national defense

but no they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different pointofview

they militate and many times resort to violence all in the name of peace

what rank hypocrisy

heck the native americans have signifigantly more interesting myths

also what about the egyptians

i think we pay so much attention to christianity because we accept it as a religion and not a mythology which i find more accurate

i try to be tolerant

it gets very hard when someone places a book under my nose and tells me its special

no

agnosticism as you have here defined it is a positive beliefa belief that it is not possible to determine the existence of any gods

thats a belief im inclined to reject

you have also defined atheism here as a positive beliefthat there is no god

a fairly large number of atheists on altatheism reject this definition instead holding that atheism is simply the absence of belief in a god

michael martin in atheism a philosophical justification distinguishes strong atheism my mistake

i will have to get a newer dictionary and read the follow up line

larry henling lmhshakescaltechedu

 atheism denies the existence of god

this is logically bankrupt  where is the proof of this nonexistence

its a joke

this is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism ie

the belief that you cant deny anything that you cant prove doesnt exist

this is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them

according to the above poster we must believe in objects or beings that havent been proved not to exist so why stop at god

there could be a huge number of beings identical to ronald reagan except for trivial differences say one is missing a finger one has blond hair and they all live on other planets so we cant see them the reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of god

fine but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of a god

here again is a classic atheist fallacy

how did they shoot themselves in the foot

 radical muslims the crusades the inquisition are common examples that atheists like to bring up as marks against religion

how weak

only fools can take that drivel seriously

how about the granddaddy of all human atrocities the stalinist movement

 twenty eight million people killed under this leadership which proudly featured atheism

there is a big difference here stalin didnt say that he stood for a particular moral position ie

against murder and terrorism etc

and then did the opposite like the religious movements he was at least an honest killer

this is not a support of stalin but an attack on this viewpoint

saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic look at all the russians that helped stalin that werent atheists  dont they contradict your point

besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people this is just the common assumption that atheists cant value life as much as theists which you didnt support

 agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable

yet they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of god is unknowable

this in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is though its less arrogant and pompous

ah and heres another point you didnt get out of the faq

an atheist doesnt have to hold the positive view that god doesnt exist heshe may just have the nonexistence of the positive belief

heres the example strong atheism  i believe god does not exist a positive belief weak atheism  i dont believe in a god a negative belief these are not the same some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable

or lets look at it this way in sets suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that i will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not

so if s  santa then es no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa

but notice that even es  no is itself another idea

this means you have lots of cases christian  aeayesbebno 





gegyes where g  god atheist strong  aea







gegno atheist weak  ae ie

no g at all in the set agnostic  ag eg  indeterminate e   why are people so afraid to say undecided

it must just be another feature of human nature  undecided is not a sexy trendy or glamorous word

it does not inspire much hate or conflict

its not blasphemous

its not political

in fact it is too often taken to mean unsophisticated

nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival trait evolution has drilled it in us to take positions even false ones

he is after all the i am which is   a statement of his inherent existence

he is existence itself

   then as mentioned above he must not be very omnipotent

    what do you mean by omnipotent here

do you mean by omnipotent  that god should be able to do anythingeverything

this creates  a selfcontradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively  useless

  to be descriptive omnipotence must mean being allpowerful and  not being able to do anythingeverything

  let me illustrate by analogy

 suppose the united states were the only nuclear power on earth

suppose  further that the us military could not effectively be countered by any  nation or group of nations

the us has the power to go into any country  at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the  us see fit

of course you can always claim that the real  reason was economics politics ethnic strife or whatever

but the  fact remains that the justification for many wars has been to conquer  the heathens

 if you want to say for instance that economics was the chief cause  of the crusades you could certainly make that point

but someone  could come along and demonstrate that it was really something else in  the same manner you show that it was really not religion

you could  in this manner eliminate all possible causes for the crusades

 scott i dont have to make outrageous claims about religions affecting and effecting history for the purpsoe of aa all i have to do point out that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate atheism

at no time have i made any statement that religion was the sole cause of anything what i have done is point out that those who do make that kind of claim are mistaken usually deliberately

to credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to misunderstand human nature the function of religion and of course history

i believe that those who distort history in this way know exaclty what theyre doing and do it only for affect

in this work swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of god

his arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late th century western christian values and aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were decisively rejected in mackies the miracle of theism

in the revised edition of the existence of god swinburne includes an appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie

j l mackie the miracle of theism oxford this posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of god

it ranges from the classical philosophical positions of descartes anselm berkeley hume et al through the moral arguments of newman kant and sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne

it also addresses those positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational such as those of kierkegaard kung and philips as well as replacements for god such as lelies axiarchism

 first post ive seen from the ol bugzoo bgsu   there is no means that i can possibly think of to prove beyond doubt  that a god does not exist but if anyone has one by all means tell me  what it is

therefore lacking this ability of absolute proof being an  atheist becomes an act of faith in and of itself and this i cannot accept

  i accept nothing on blind faith

 invisible pink flying unicorns

need i say more

there is also the question of what is meant by atheist

a familiar example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows

the two statements following are consistent  i do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks  i do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks the two statements following are not consistent  i do believe that you are wearing lilac socks  i do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks statements  and  require no faith they make no presumptions about the nature of reality

statements  and  require belief

many atheists myself included take the following position  i do not believe that there is a god

i do not believe that there is not a god

that is  i harbor no beliefs at all there is no good evidence for god existing or not

some folks call this agnosticism

it does not suffer from blind faith at all

replyto tclarkmeduncedu organization unc school of medicine lines  i dont think there is really any question about which god the courts mean

in the courts of nc at least it is always an old and new testament

though it is hard to imagine picking up the bible and swearing to whatever god is sometimes the least of the religious influence

it clearly shows the sore points  with religion  in other words show me a movement that cant spin  off khomeinis stalins davidians husseins

we humans have got it

anybody using  their freewill can tell lies and halftruths about any system and  thus abuse it for their own ends

i dont think such tools exist either

im only saying that anything can happen under atheism

being a beleiver a knowledgeable one in religion only good can happen

this is becoming a tiresome statement

coming from you it is a definition not an assertion islam is good

belief in islam is good

therefore being a believer in islam can produce only goodbecause islam is good

blah blah blah

thats about as circular as it gets and equally meaningless

to say that something produces only good because it is only good that it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition

and all youre application is saying that its true if you really believe its true

thats silly

conversely you say offhandedly that anything can happen under atheism

again just an offshoot of believeitanditbecomestrue dontbelieveitanditdoesnt

like other religions im aquainted with islam teaches exclusion and caste and suggests harsh penalties for behaviors that have no logical call for punishment certain limits on speech and sex for example

to me this is not good

i see much pain and suffering without any justification except for the waving of the hand of some inaccessible god

by the by you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly

for what is a knowledgeable believer except a contradiction of terms

i infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith

pl lines  joel hanes jjhdiagamdahlcom wrote  mr connors assertion that more complex  later in paleontology  is simply incorrect

many lineages are known in which whole  structures are lost  for example snakes have lost their legs

 cave fish have lost their eyes

some species have almost completely  lost their males

kiwis are descended from birds with functional  wings

joel the statements i made were illustrative of the inescapably anthrpomorphic quality of any desciption of an evolutionary process

there is no way evolution can be described or explained in terms other than teleological that is my whole point

even those who have reason to believe they understand evolution biologists for instance tend to personify nature and i cant help but wonder if its because of the limits of the language or the nature of nature

in article aprwamumdedu westnextwamumdedu writes   and belief causes far more horrors

  crusades   the emasculation and internment of native americans   the killing of various tribes in south america

 the inquisition  the counterreformation and the wars that followed  the salem witch trials  the european witch hunts  the holy wars of the middle east  the colonizationdestruction of africa  the wars between christianity and islam post crusade  the genocide biblical of the canaanites and philistines  aryian invasion of india  the attempted genocide of jews by nazi germany  the current missionary assaults on tribes in africa   i think all the horrors you mentioned are due to lack of people  following religion

d

by lack of people following religion i also include fanatics people that dont know what they are following

d

so how do you know that you were right

why are you trying to shove down my throat that religion causes horrors

it really covers yourself something false to save yourself

 peace  bobby mozumder  i just thought of another one in the bible so its definately not because of lack of religion

the book of esther which i read the other day for other reasons describes the origin of purim a jewish celbration of joy and peace

the long and short of the story is that  people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about you couldnt swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice peaceful solution

course joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind

i agree with bobby this far religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for

that doesnt reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the universe

the very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war

many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomachecontentsthan in any absolute truth and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders

the point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war

whether these things are a part of religion an unpleasant side effect or as bobby would have it the result of people switching between religion and atheism spontaneously the results are the same

religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of mans history

 atheists on the other hand preenpreen are typically not an ideological social caste nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs

the overuse of nazism and stalinism just show how true this is two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means

anyone who cannot see the obvious  namely that these were groups founded for reasons entirely their own who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull  is trying too hard

basically bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were not specifically fought over religion that he does not have many choices

well im off to key west where the only flames are heating the bottom of little silver butterdishes

ciao chris blask

i think that about  or so people approve of the death penalty even realizing all of its shortcomings

doesnt this make it reasonable

or are you the sole judge of reasonability

aside from revenge what merits do you find in capital punishment

are we talking about me or the majority of the people that support it

anyway i think that revenge or fairness is why most people are in favor of the punishment

if a murderer is going to be punished people that think that he should get what he deserves

most people wouldnt think it would be fair for the murderer to live while his victim died

revenge

petty and pathetic

perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic but your views are in the minority

we have a local televised hot topic talk show that very recently did a segment on capital punishment

each and every advocate of the use of this portion of our system of jurisprudence cited the main reason for supporting it that bastard deserved it

true human compassion forgiveness and sympathy

where are we required to have compassion forgiveness and sympathy

if someone wrongs me i will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage is removed or a similar situation is forced upon him

if someone kills another then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn

is not our entire moral system based on such a concept

or are you stating that human life is sacred somehow and that it should never be violated

this would sound like some sort of religious view

i mean how reasonable is imprisonment really when you think about it

sure the person could be released if found innocent but you still cant undo the imiprisonment that was served

perhaps we shouldnt imprision people if we could watch them closely instead

the cost would probably be similar especially if we just implanted some sort of electronic device

would you rather be alive in prison or dead in the chair

once a criminal has committed a murder his desires are irrelevant

and you still have not answered my question

if you are concerned about the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent then why isnt this same concern shared with imprisonment

shouldnt we by your logic administer as minimum as punishment as possible to avoid violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person

keith

and what about that revelation thing charley

 if youre talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well its obviously a risk one takes

 i see it is not rational but it is intellectual

does madness qualify as intellectual engagement too

many people say that the concept of metaphysical and religious knowledge is contradictive

 im not an objectivist so im not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization

the problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience

one can get some rough understanding but the language is from the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the perspective of whats being described rather inexact to be charitable

 exactly why science uses mathematics

qm representation in natural language is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical terminology

nor is it supposed to be the truth as opposed to the representation of gods or religions in ordinary language

admittedly not every religion says so but a fancy side effect of their inept representations are the eternal hassles between religions

and qm allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will be agreed upon as being similar

show me something similar in religion

an analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is that the better descriptive language is not available

 with the effect that the models presented are useless

and one can argue that the other way around namely that the only reason metaphysics still flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified  showing that it is bogus

and in case it holds reliable information can you show how you establish that

 this word reliable is essentially meaningless in the context unless you can show how reliability can be determined

havent you read the many posts about what reliability is and how it can be acheived respectively determined

benedikt

first i want to start right out and say that im a christian

well this is altatheism

i hope you arent here to try to convert anyone

it makes sense to be one

many would disagree

 the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was

well you shouldnt give any particular book too much weight

actually i dont think that any of these statements is correct

it is more likely that most of jesus fame was attributed to him after his death by those who had some strong motives  some other things to note

he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone

whats a prophecy and whats so significant about them

i dont think most people understand what a christian is

i think we understand

it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches

rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for gods sake

well sell your computer and donate you life to your religion now dont waste any time

keith

 i think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how  deviant the view as ive articulated it above which may not be  the true view of khomeini is from the basic principles of islam

  from the point ov view of an atheist i see you claim khomeini wasnt  practicing true islam

but im sure that he would have said the same about  you

how am i a member of neither group supposed to be able to tell which  one of you two is really a true muslim

fred rice answered this already in an early posting the problem with your argument is that you do not know who is a real believer and who may be faking it

this is something known only by the person himherself and god

your assumption that anyone who claims to be a believer is a believer is not necessarily true

in other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and false muslim

we are back to square one khomeini and hussein are still innocent and cant be defined as evil or good islamic worshippers

cheers kent  sandviknewtonapplecom

alink ksand  private activities on the net

assuming you are presenting it accurately i dont see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion

the material in john im not sure exactly what is referred to here but ill take for granted the similarity to the mattluke q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john getting it straight from jesus mouth

 no the argument says john has known q ie a codified version of the logia and not the original assuming that there has been one

it has weaknesses of course like that john might have known the original yet rather referred to q in his text or that the logia were given in a codified version in the first place

the argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion but it fits well into the dating usually given for the gospels

we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors

the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages

it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark

 the version of the usual theory i have heard has matthew and luke independently relying on mark and q

one would think that if luke relied on matthew we wouldnt have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing

 not necessarily luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the version given by matthew

improving on matthew would give a motive for instance

as far as i know the theory that luke has known matthew is based on a statistical analysis of the texts

as it is assumed that john knew the content of lukes text

the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly

 this is the part that is particularly new to me

if it were possible that you could point me to a reference id be grateful

 yep but it will take another day or so to get the source

i hope your german is good enough

 unfortunately i havent got the info at hand

it was i think in the late s or early s and it was possibly as old as ce 

 when they are from about  why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three

 because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing copy quit a bit

the further away from the original the more copies can be written and therefore survival becomes more probable

 i still do not see how copies from  allow to change the dating of john

that john was a disciple is not generally accepted

the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument

 im not really impressed with the theology argument

but im really pointing this out as an if

and as i pointed out earlier one cannot make these arguments about i peter i see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter

 yes but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence

the authencity of many letters is still discussed

it looks as if conclusions about them are not drawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them as well

one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times

compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies

 the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is not so bad

 well rather like some newsletter of a political party reporting from the big meeting

not necessarily wrong but certainly bad

in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak

 but the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case its agreed that the most important epistles predate mark

yes but the accuracy of their tradition is another problem

question are there letters not from paul and predating mark claiming the divinity of jesus

benedikt

subject re ancient islamic rituals i propose that these two trends  greater level of general depression in society and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity  are linked with the latter being a prime cause of the former

i cannot provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis seems very reasonable to me and i request that people ponder upon it

 damn right you cant provide any evidence for it

rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a simple premise

if they were psychology would be a hard science with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics

your premise may well be right

it is much more likely however that it reflects your socialization and religious background as well as your need to validate your religious beliefs

were i to pretend to have all the answers and i dont i would say that the xenophobia guilt and intolerance brought about by adherence to fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing the members of our society

your mileage obviously varies

in article buedu jaegerbuphybuedu gregg jaeger writes  hed have to be precise about is rejection of god and his leaving islam

one is perfectly free to be muslim and to doubt and question the existence of god so long as one does not reject god

i am sure that rushdie has be now made his atheism clear in front of a sufficient number of proper witnesses

the question in regard to the legal issue is his status at the time the crime was committed

 ill also add that it is impossible to actually tell when one rejects god

therefore you choose to punish only those who talk about it

 jim halat

just what do gay people do that straight people dont

absolutely nothing

im a very straightas an arrow year old male that is involved in the bsa

i dont care what gay people do among each other as long as they dont make passes at me or anything

at my summer camp where i work my boss is gay

not in a pansy way of gay i know a few but just one of the guys

he doesnt push anything on me and we give him the same respect back due to his position

if anything the bsa has taught me i dont know tolerance or something

before i met this guy i thought all gays were faries

so the bsa has taught me to be an antibigot

basically it comes down to this what you do among yourself is your own business

no one else has the right to tell you otherwise unless it violates someone elses civil rights

reference line trimmed  liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes    there is a good deal more confusion here

you started off with the assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit here you finished up with a recursive definition

murder is objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself requires an appeal to morality

 i think you mean circular not recursive but that is semantics

recursiveness has no problems it is just horribly inefficient just ask any assembly programmer

yes

 now you have switch targets a little but only a little

now you are asking what is the goal

what do you mean by goal

are you suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere and we form our morals to achieve it

 well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and propogation of the species

another example of a moral system is presented within the declaration of independence which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

you see to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system

that is we shall be moral unto what end

the oftquoted line that says people should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights is a complete lie and deception as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving

liberty is never free it is always purchased at some cost almost always at the cost to another

whos liberty is more inalienable

similarly for right of life

when one person must die if he is to save another or even a group of others whos life is more inalienable

that leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty especially for serial killers

whos life and liberty is more valuable the serial killer or the victim

according to that beautiful line those two rights should be completely inviolate that is noone should be able to remove them

this includes government

admittedly the serial killer has restricted some peoples life andor liberty but is not his own lifeliberty inviolate also

according to the declaration of independence it is

murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule

and i thought i had defined murder as an intentional killing of a nonmurderer against his will

oooh i like that

it means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will

reason an infant has no will as such

similarly for people who are brain dead easier to see in a coma etc

also under current law accidental killing is still murder

how will you include that

and you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not

i fail to see what this has to do with anything

i never claimed that our system of morality was an objective one

i thought that was your very first claim

that there was some kind of objective morality and that an example of that was that murder is wrong

if you dont want to claim that any more thats fine

the only real golden rule in life is he who has the gold makes the rules

ie

might makes right

that is survival

now what is wrong with that

well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most every moral system

however i am not assuming that our current system and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral

i think that it is a very good approximation but we cant be perfect

if you mean the golden rule as i stated yes almost every system as implemented has used that in reality

sorry i dont deal as much in fiction as i do in reality

and by the way you dont seem to understand the difference between arbitrary and objective

if keith schneider defines murder to be this that and the other thats arbitrary

jon livesey may still say well according to my personal system of morality all killing of humans against their will is murder and wrong and what the legal definition of murder may be in the usa kuweit saudi arabia or the prc may be matters not a whit to me

welcome to ozland

 what is not arbitrary

if you can find some part of society some societal rules morals etc

that are not arbitrary please tell me

i dont think there are any

well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning

 keith sounds like euphemisms to me

the difference seems to be that objective is some reasoning that i like while arbitrary is some reasoning that i dont like or dont understand

compuservecom subject enviroleague birth announcement on march   from earth forum compuserve information service  formal announcement  sm enviroleague a new youth movementenviroleague was recently born according to its founder boyd r critz iii cis id  of peoria illinois

enviroleague exists for the education of youth both male and female in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment

incorporated as an illinois notforprofit corporation its articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed

according to critz its draft bylaws contain the following statement of mission and objectives mission it is the mission of enviroleague and its adult members to foster and implement the improved education of young people in the need to conduct their lives as stewards of the earth to leave the earth in a better condition than they found it and to otherwise act as responsible moral and ethical users of their environment

to pursue the accomplishment of this mission enviroleague shall seek to serve as a catalyst focusing in common cause the separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation improvement and responsible use of the environment in which we must all live

objectives in pursuit of the mission of enviroleague its primary objectives shall be  to establish a movement involving as many environmentally concerned organizations as possible said movement having as its primary focus the education and participatory involvement of young people in appropriate areas of environmental concern  to develop and provide to such organizations and their branches a full complement of program materials for their use including suitable uniforms insignia and other badges written ideas syllabi and information literature and other items as shall seem appropriate and desirable  to serve as a clearing house for the exchange of program ideas materials and information among said organizations and  to assist environmentally concerned organizations to recruit and train the necessary adult leadership for their youth programs

enviroleague will operate through three program divisions serving youth in the elementary middle and high school grades respectively

service shall be through formation of enviroleague teams either by enviroleague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations or their local branches wishing a charter to use programs developed by enviroleague

enviroleague as it develops will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local team and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct

organizations accepting a charter may however impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material

should such organizations do so enviroleague will commit itself to forming as soon as possible new nearby teams having no such restrictions particularly as to youth membership

enviroleague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs

thus the top youth leaders of its teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level

program materials are in development at this time

copies of the draft portions of the mentors manual manual for adult leadership will be in the earth forum library 

these files will be updated as development takes place

compuserve is particularly proud that enviroleagues founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation

this announcement is being made simultaneously in both the outdoor and earth forums

the electronic home of enviroleague is in compuserves earth forum  go earth  message and library areas  both named enviroleague

 subsequently enviroleagues initial governance council has held its first meeting

boyd critz was elected as the first enviroleague chief guardian equivalent to chairman of the board or ceo

he can be reached at home   in case of real need

also mail can be addressed to enviroleague po

 something defined contradictorily cannot exist

that what the believe in does  not exist

secondly there are better explanations for why they believe than  the existence of the object of their belief

   have you read the faq already

 benedikt benedikt i cant recall anyone claiming that god makes anyone act a particlar way i think that youre attempting to manufacture a contradiction

god is said to require certain behavior but the only compulsion is the believers sense of duty

a standard of conduct does exist but we are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever ways we find convenient but our response to gods edicts can in no way be used to question gods existence

the behavior of believers is a completely separate question from that of gods existence there is nothing contradictory here

to say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist is really asking too much you would have existence depend on grammar

all you can really say is that something is poorly defined but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything other than confusion of course

your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief than the object of belief may lead to a rats nest of unnecessary complexity

what are the volumes that it speaks besides the fact that he leaves your choices up to you

 as for the trap you are not in a position to tell me that i dont  believe in god because i do not wish to

unless you can know my  motivations better than i do myself you should believe me when i  say that i earnestly searched for god for years and never found  him

nanci ann miller writes my favorite reply to the you are being too literalminded complaint is that if the bible is really inspired by god and if it is really that important to him then he would make damn certain all the translators and scribes and people interpreting and copying it were getting it right literally

if not then why should i put any merit at all in something that has been corrupted over and over and over by man even if it was originally inspired by god

the corrupted over and over theory is pretty weak

comparison of the current hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the text has in fact changed very little over a space of some two millennia

this shouldnt be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this manner are likely to makes some pains to make good copies

 do you honestly hold to that tripe charley

for a start there are enough current versions of the bible to make comparisons to show that what you write above is utter garbage

witness jw mormon catholic anglican and greek orthodox bibles

but to really convince you id have to take you to a good old library

in our local library we had a  king james which i compared to a brand new hot of gods tongue good news bible

genesis was almost unrecognisable many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the good news bible

in fact the god of good news was a much more congenial fellow i must say

if you like ill get the  king james out again and actually give you some quotes

at least the headings havent changed much

from kempmpphoenixoulufi petri pihko subject re is morality constant was re biblical rape organization university of oulu finland xnewsreader tin version 

pl lines  bill conner bilokcforumosrheedu wrote  there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread  that are a little confusing

an atheist is one for whom all things can  be understood as processes of nature  exclusively

this definition does not include all atheists see the faq

however i for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations

it makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter

humans are not omnipotent and neither is science

however science has one advantage theology doesnt it is self correcting with nature as its judge

it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self consistent simple picture of our universe

science is no longer a bunch of separate branches it is one

from particle physics to psychology

and no aspect of our life or our universe is safe from its stern and stony eye

not even our consciousness

there is no need  for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything

there is  no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by  physics chemistry biology etc

 everything is random nothing is  determnined

actually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not

i think the question does not have any meaning as far as individual human beings go

if their apparent free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their perspective

bill can you say for sure whether you have a free will or not

 this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all  its products

there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it  acquire intelligence its just a happy accident

maybe

who are we to tell

it seems intelligence is useful  when during the history of earth has one species been able to control one third of the whole biosphere

this can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves

even that machinery can be result of the same principle  only the systems that can start replicating will survive those which dont dont make it

recommended reading to  for an atheist no  event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less  value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about  an event can have value

from whose perspective

i value events and things subjectively from my perspective

nature does not have values because it does not have a perspective  values arise from awareness

if i have a subjective perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their position i will eventually discover the golden rule

morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution

perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity too

bill have you ever read aristotle

try his ethica nikomakhea sp

for starters

 how then can an atheist judge value

what is the basis for criticizing  the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god

on  what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned

it  seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you  have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what  in nature can serve that purpose

what law of nature can you invoke to  establish your values

cs

lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became christian

the argument is severely flawed

some values such as the golden rule can have a rational basis

some others like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired

lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality as well

indeed as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools they also became better at killing each other

it is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools but not against ones own people

the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jews was not beyond this

a simple set of rules to hold the people together under one god

their god did not care much about people of other nations

at the time of the nt things were quite different  the jews were under rule of an empire and could no longer simply ignore the gentiles

a new situation required a new morality and along with it a new religion was born

a mutation in a meme pool

 since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what  difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or  otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value

the only  way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the  objection is entirely subjective and that heshe just doesnt like it   thats it

any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer  that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries  no weight in any absolute sense

it looks like you havent bothered to read philosophy

whenever there is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result of some physical event and others happiness too if the observer comes to think about it

in an absolutely objective sense that is without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose their meaning

it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view

this includes gods too their values are only their personal judgments not absolute truths since such truths do not exist

the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others existence

morality is not property of humans alone  chimps dolphins and many other species show great care for each other

dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed

 that you dont like what god told people to do says nothing about god  or gods commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your  nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled  with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction

that your  objections seem well founded is due to the way youve been  conditioned there is no truth content

the whole of your  intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality

the last statement does not logically follow

in fact there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well and our senses can convey reliable information

solipsism is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one

you are continuously mixing two different views the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view which does not exist

any observer or thinker any personal being has its own point of view

it does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not it does not cease to be subjective

from a nonobservers nonpoint of view values do not exist

neither does pain or pleasure or beauty or love

such things are inherently subjective

once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us if we dont i disagree with his morals

i do not think my morals come from any supreme being  to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought

if god gave us morality to judge but i disagree with him it is not my fault

he is free to replace my morals

i cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with ones own and then to get mad at this

god must be schizophrenic

 all of this being so you have excluded  yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil  etc

and cannot participate

your opinion about the bible can have no  weight whatsoever

neither can the opinion of any god for that matter

i cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else

bill take note absolute values must be independent of any being including gods

if god has a subjective viewpoint it is his own point of view and his morals are his own

organization penn state university from andrew newell tanpsuvmpsuedu subject re free moral agency distribution na cpxqslmdarksideosrheuoknoredu lines  in article cpxqslmdarksideosrheuoknoredu bilokcforumosrheedu bill conner says  deankaflowitz decaycbnewsjcbattcom wrote   now what i am interested in is the original notion you were discussing  on moral free agency

that is how can a god punish a person for  not believing in him when that person is only following his or her  nature and it is not possible for that person to deny what his or  her reason tells him or her which is that there is no god

 i think youre letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth a traditional or legendary story a beliefwhose truth is accepted uncritically

how does that qualify

indeed its almost oxymoronica rather amusing instance

ive found that most atheists hold almost no atheistviews as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend

many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they dont meet the other criterions

also divine justice

according to the most fundamental doctrines of christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time the you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology

this time meeting all the requirements of myth

salvation

the idea of punishment is based on the proposition that everyone knows instinctively

that god exists is their creator and ah but not everyone knows that god exists

so you have a fallacy

theres nothing terribly difficult in all this and is well known to any reasonably biblically literate christian

the only controversy is and that makes it true

holding with the bible rules out controversy

read the faq

if youve read it you missed something so reread

not a bad suggestion for anyonei reread it just before this

with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it means

when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and dont know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says that everyone knows

the authority of the bible is its claim to be should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across

you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesnt make it any more credible to me

if the bible says that everyone knows thats clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged gods alleged existance

refuted while the specieswide condemnation is justified

those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is no excuse

no they dont have to ignore the bible

the bible is far from universally accepted

the bible is not a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god

or does it prove even that

they might have been writing it as series of fiction shortstories

as in the case of dionetics

assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it

and thats ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblicalphilosophers were correct

there are people who have truly never heard of the bible

again read the faq

freedom

you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both cases

that an atheist cant accept the evidence means only bzztwrong answer

gravity is directly there

it doesnt stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it

god on the other hand doesnt generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloids

god doesnt exert a rationally undeniable influence

gravity is obvious gods arent

secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature

human reason always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in no human reason hasnt always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god

in other words it doesnt generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god

and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesnt pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there

from a worldwide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be andor what forces are currently in control

a natural tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful thinking

i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it is

whether you agree or not xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions and its reasonableness certainly doesnt merit eminence

divine justicewell it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity

first not all atheists believe the same things about human nature

second whether most atheists are correct or not you certainly are not correct on human nature

you are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach

try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity

it costs far  more to execute a criminal in this country than it does to feed  clothe and shelter them for the remainder of their natural life

 some people believe this is a fault of our judicial system

i  find it to be one of its greatest virtues

why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards depression

you cant just pick your two favorite trends notice a correlation in them and make a sweeping statement of generality

i mean you can and people have but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis

at best its a gross oversimplification of the pushpull factors people experience

i agree i reckon its television and the increase in fundamentalism you think its the increase in premarital sex others thinks its because psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent criminals con them into letting them out into the streets others think its the increase in designer drugs others think its a communist plot

basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society are far too complicated for us to control

we just have to hold on to the panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing

subject re dont more innocents die without the death penalty

 by maintaining classes d and e even in prison it seems as if we place more innocent people at a higher risk of an unjust death than we would if the state executed classes d and e with an occasional error

 i answer from the position that we would indeed place these people in prison for life

that depends not only on their predisposition towards murder but also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability to commit the same crimes again

in other words if lifetime imprisonment doesnt work perhaps its not because were not executing these people but because were not being careful enough about how we lock them up

from dpwseicmuedu david wood subject request for support organization software engineering institute lines  i have a request for those who would like to see charley wingate respond to the charley challenges and judging from my email there appear to be quite a few of you

it is clear that mr wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the challenges themselves

between the last two repostings of the challenges i noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by mr wingate none of which answered a single challenge

it seems unmistakable to me that mr wingate hopes that the questions will just go away and he is doing his level best to change the subject

given that this seems a rather common nettheist tactic i would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers in the following manner 

ignore any future articles by mr wingate that do not address the challenges until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so

or 

if you must respond to one of his articles include within it something similar to the following please answer the questions posed to you in the charley challenges

really im not looking to humiliate anyone here i just want some honest answers

you wouldnt think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout christian would you

last resort mail mathewmantiscouk or post an article to the newsgroup asking how you can get the faq files

you should only do this if youve tried the above methods and theyve failed its not nice to clutter the newsgroup or peoples mailboxes with requests for files

its better than posting without reading the faq though

for instance people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who dont have ftp will probably need assistance obtaining the faq files

date sat  apr   gmt from fred rice dariceyoyoccmonasheduau  in pivtcfjfidoasdsgicom liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes  should we british go around blowing up skyscrapers next

 i dont know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying  that the person accused of blowing up the wtc in ny actually did it and  that islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the wtc

 wtc  world trade centre which was the building that was blown up i think

 okay to make some comments   the person has only been accused  innocent until proven guilty remember

secondly there seem to be some holes in his accusation that i read about

for instance if they guy used that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly stupid

perhaps salamen was one of those uneducated muslims we hear so much about

nevertheless he was apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated bomb

it doesnt seem to fit together somehow

actually salameh was not the only person involved

the other fellow was a chemical engineer working for allied signal who had specifically studied explosive devices in school believe it or not  we actually allow radical muslim types to study things like this in our universities  so much for the price of freedom from what i read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone

the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a i assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instructions over the phone 

one must need some brains i would expect

despite this there have already been many attacks and threats against mosques and muslims in the united states as a consequence of his accusation i have read

 ok now please tell us where this is happening

i live in the us and i have heard very little about these mosque attacks

there are many mosques in houston texas and i would like to know what is going on so i can verify this

or is the great jewish media conspiracy keeping us from knowing about this in the us we heard about the mosque attacks during the desert storm venture so why is it so quiet now

maybe it is localized to new jersey

i read this in an article in the australian muslim times the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community

if this is true perhaps one of the muslims based in north america if they see this posting can elaborate

 islamic teachings teach against harming the innocent

in the quran it explicitly teaches against harming innocents even in times of war

the blowing up of the wtc and harming innocents is therefore in blatant contradiction to islamic teachings

this means absolutely nothing

plenty of people commit violence while following what they think are valid religious principles

i have seen people post many things here from the koran which could be misinterpreted if that is the explanation you wish to use by an uneducated muslim to allow them to harm idolators and unbelievers

the first thing every muslim says is that no muslim could have done that because islam teaches against harming innocents

and we are supposed to take you word that it never happens

what do you think is the consequence

does allah strike them down before the alleged violence occurs

of course not

muslims commit the violent act and then everyone hides behind verses in the koran

were pretty hip to that trick

and i even doubt that it will come up in the trials

my defense is that i am muslim and islam teaches me not to harm the innocent

therefore the people who were killed must not have been innocent

sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir i am a muslim

allah is allpowerful

allah would not have allowed this

are you insulting my religion

great defense eh

just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent muslims in the world and stop hiding from that fact

it does no one any good to deny it

it only makes the more reasonable muslims look like they are protecting the bad ones

can you see that

i dont deny this fact

the thrust of my argument here is that a salameh is according to us law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law

as his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption

b islam teaches us not to harm innocents

if muslims  who perhaps have not realized that islam teaches this  perform such actions it is not because of the teachings of islam but rather in spite of and in contradiction to the teachings of islam

this is an important distinction

i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say muslim

in general anyone who calls themselves a muslim and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim

thus one who might do things contrary to islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly not become a muslim

if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave islam

the term muslim is to be contrasted with mumin which means true believer

however whether a muslim is in reality a mumin is something known only by god and perhaps that person himself

so you will not find the term mumin used very much by muslims in altatheism because it is not known to anybody except myself and god whether i for example am a true believer or not

for example i could just be putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what i write here without anyone knowing

thus when we say muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teachings

by muslim we do not necessarily mean mumin or true believer in islam

fred rice dariceyoyoccmonasheduau

if i kill this person an innocent person convicted of murder then a murder would be committed but i would not be the murderer

at least i wouldnt reasonably be considered a murderer with reasonable being introduced as a fudge factor necessary to account for the inability to be totally objective due to a lack of absolutely true information

if society collective decides to carry the burden of executing its citizens then it also carries the blame for their innocent blood

each and every voter who casts a ballot in favor of capital punishment is in part guilty of the murder of each and every innocent victim of the system

why are only those people in favor of the system to blame

if society accepts such a system then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed

those that are not in favor should work to convince others

and most members of our society have accepted the blametheyve considered the risk to be acceptable

similarly every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents

this is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving

it is all a question of what risk is acceptable

it is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed

 in article pqtinnlpsenatorbedfellowmitedu  bobsthnextmitedu robert singleton writes   deletion    i will argue that your latter statement i believe that no gods exist  does rest upon faith  that is if you are making a positive statement  that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i dont  know and therefore dont believe in them and dont not believe in then  weak atheism

once again to not believe in god is different than  saying i believe that god does not exist

i still maintain the  position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires  faith

    no it in the way it is usually used

in my view you are saying here  that driving a car requires faith that the car drives

 im not saying this at all  it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because ive seen it drive  ive done more than at in fact  ive actually driven it

now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of whats out there

but there is no evidence  pro or con  for the existence or nonexistence of god see what i have to say below on this

 for me it is a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i  have in the premises and the argument used

 sorry if i remain skeptical  i dont believe its entirely a conclusion

that you have seen no evidence that there is a god is correct  neither have i

but lack of evidence for the existence of something is in no way evidence for the nonexistence of something the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation

you personally have never seen a neutrino before but they exist

the pink unicorn analogy breaks down and is rather naive

i have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life  evolution

when i draw the conclusion that pink unicorns dont exist because i havent seen them this conclusion has its foundation in observation and theory

a pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities

that is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such

god however has no such correspondence with anything imo

there is no physical frame work of observation to draw any conclusions from

 but first let me say the following

 we might have a language problem here  in regards to faith and  existence

i as a christian maintain that god does not exist

 to exist means to have being in space and time

god does not have  being  god is being

kierkegaard once said that god does not  exist he is eternal

with this said i feel its rather pointless  to debate the so called existence of god  and that is not what  im doing here

i believe that god is the source and ground of  being

when you say that god does not exist i also accept this  statement  but we obviously mean two different things by it

however  in what follows i will use the phrase the existence of god in its  usual sense  and this is the sense that i think you are using it

 i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of  god

    no thats a word game

i disagree with you profoundly on this

i havent defined god as existence  in fact i havent defined god

but this might be getting off the subject  although if you think its relevant we can come back to it

  further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is  already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are  implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument  so far are incomplete making it a fallacy

 you are using wrong categories here  or perhaps you misunderstand what im saying

im making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy

im not trying to convince you of anything

i believe  and that rests upon faith

and it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tells you that they can logically prove god or that they have evidence or  then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary

btw an incomplete argument is not a fallacy  some things are not even wrong

  deletion  one can never prove that god does or does not exist

when you say  that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion  based upon observation i will have to ask what observtions are  you refering to

there are no observations  pro or con  that  are valid here in establishing a positive belief

 deletion   where does that follow

arent observations based on the assumption  that something exists

 i dont follow you here

certainly one can make observations of things that they didnt know existed

i still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that god does not exist

such a positive assertion requires a leap

 and wouldnt you say there is a level of definition that the assumption  god is is meaningful

if not i would reject that concept anyway

  so where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some  level

once again you seem to completely misunderstand me

i have no evidence that god is is meaningful at any level

maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of god down your throat

i however am not doing this

i am arguing one and only one thing  that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap  it requires faith

i am as you would say a theist however there is a form of atheism that i can respect  but it must be founded upon honesty

 liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes   i want to know how this omniscient being is going to perform  the feat of definitely terming actions right or wrong

  if you were omniscient youd know who exactly did what and with what  purpose in mind

then with a particular goal in mind you sould be  able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance  with the general goal

but now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way and i dont think youve even noticed

in another part of this thread youve been telling us that the goal of a natural morality is what animals do to survive

but suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some other species either terrestrial or alien

does that make it moral to do so

from deweyriscspsmotcom dewey henize subject re the inimitable rushdie organization motorola inc  austintx lines  nntppostinghost rtfmspsmotcom is it just me or has this part gotten beyond useful

gregg is not as i understand his posts giving any support to the bounty on rushdies life

if thats correct end of one point gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most westerners dont accept

his comments about islamic law i think make a great deal of sense to him and are even making a little sense to me now  if a person is a member of a group religion or whatever they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum

the big bone of contention here that im picking up is that in the west we have secular governments that maintain more or less a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups

i think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune note  i didnt say in agreement with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen

with that in mind it not possible under secular law legally as most people would define the term to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it

only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort contractual etc is there any secular enforcement allowed by a group to a group member or past group member

a religion can and often does believe in and require additional duties of a group member

and it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways  ostracism is common for example

but the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted andor unaccepted onus on a person in conflict with secular law

this is the difference

in a theocracy the requirements of the secular authorities are by definition congruent with the religious authorities

outside a theocracy this is not necessarily true

religious requirements may coincide or may not

similiarly religious consequences may or may not coincide with secular consequences if any

in article aprlelandstanfordedu rushlelandstanfordedu voelkerding writes  if we worry about the one case in  or more where an innocent man is convicted of something horrible enough to warrant the death penalty and hence put laws into place which make it virtually impossible to actually execute real criminals then the death penalty is not serving its original purpose

it should either be changed or done away with

   i dont have numbers to back this up so take the following  accordingly

  you use an offthecuff number of  in  innocent people  sentenced to die as an acceptable loss for the benefit of capital  punishment

id be very very surprised if the ratio were that  low

there have been approximately a dozen known cases of the  execution of the innocent in the us since the turn of the century

 have we in that same period sentenced  people to death

 accounting for those cases that we dont know the truth it seems  reasonable to assume that twice that many innocent people have in  fact been executed

that would raise the number of death  sentences metered out since  to half a million for your  acceptance ratio to hold

i rather doubt thats the case

   the point of course is what is an acceptable loss

in  

seems were probably not doing even that well

or should we perhaps find a better solution

   bob beauchaine bobbeviceicotekcom  any suggestions as to what a better solution might be

i realize the offhand nature of the numbers i used

and i cant answer as to what an acceptable loss rate is

however as i said in another post i despise the idea of supporting criminals for life

its the economics of the situation that concern me most

the money spent feeding clothing housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are unfit to live in society could go to a number of places all of which i and probably others would consider far more worthwhile and which would enrish the lives of all americans

in madhauscckiphnetcomcom madhausnetcomcom maddi hausmann writes  mark how much do you really know about vegetarian diets

the problem is not some bvitamins its balancing proteins

there is also one vitamin that cannot be obtained from nonanimal products and this is only of concern to vegans who eat no meat dairy or eggs

i believe it is b and it is the only problem

supplements are available for vegans yes the b does come from animal byproducts

if you are on an ovolacto vegetarian diet eat dairy and eggs this is not an issue

 i didnt see the original posting but yes i do know about vegetarian diets considering that several of my close friends are devout vegetarians and have to take vitamin supplements

b was one of the ones i was thinking of it has been a long time since i read the article i once saw talking about the special dietary needs of vegetarians so i didnt quote full numbers

considering how nice this place is

  b can also come from wholegrain rice i understand

some brands here in australia and other places too im sure get the b in the b tablets from wholegrain rice

 are you sure those arent an enriched type

i know it is basically rice and soybeans to get almost everything you need but i hadnt heard of any rice having b

 just thought id contribute on a different issue from the norm   you should have contributed to the programming thread earlier

   fred rice  dariceyoyoccmonasheduau  m  if one is a vegan a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at ie eggs milk cheese etc after about  years of a vegan diet you need to start taking b supplements because b is found only in animals

acutally our bodies make b i think but our bodies use up our own b after  or  years

lactooveo vegetarians like myself still get b through milk products and eggs so we dont need supplements

yes i did

you see i dont think that rape and murder should be dealt with lightly

you being so interested in leniency for leniencys sake apparently think that people should simply be told the did a bad thing

 straw man

and you brought up leniency

and what about the simple chance of misjudgements

 misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible

i suspect that its pretty unlikely that given my requirement of repeated offenses that misjudgments are very likely

 assuming that misjudgements are not correlated

deletion i just love to compare such lines to the common plea of your fellow believers not to call each others names

in this case to substantiate it the quran allows that one beats ones wife into submission

  really

care to give chapter and verse

we could discuss it

 has been discussed here

chapter and verse were cited i assume that you werent looking then

lets be more exact do you think it is not in the quran

and what would your consequences be when it it was shown to be in it

primitive machism refers to that

i have misspelt that before my fault

 again not all of the orient follows the quran

so youll have to do better than that

 i have not claimed that

it is sufficient for the argument when there are a lot of male dominated societies that qualify as machistic

are you going to say that the situation of women is better in sufficeint areas of the orient

deletion this is an argument for why you dont like religions that suppress sex

a such its an irrelevant argument

 if youd like to generalize it to an objective statement then fine

my response is then you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion one of your arguments

 the urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it

if the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner

 you apparently have trouble reading things you dont like

the point was having sex the way one wishes being a strong desire

marriage is a red herring

tell me about homosexuals for one

you simply ignore everything that doesnt fit into the world as you would like to have it

and as for the situation of adolescents one has probably keep your combination of leniency and maiming in mind whe you say that it does not take overly strong measures to suppress the urge for sex in adolescents

in article buedu jaegerbuphybuedu gregg jaeger writes  the authorities i am referring to is the authority of the world  islamic community over itself

my point was simply that islamic  law does apply to muslims wherever they are despite the fact that  islamic law may not be enforcable in nonislamic countries

muslims residing in the uk may decide to be tried or whatever by the islamic community but their rulings have no legal consequences in these isles

its not really their decision to be tried

the rulings do have legal consequences but only in islamic law and not in uk law this should be obvious

enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making of a judgment

take for example the judgments of the world court

this is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic effect but which are important despite the fact that their judgments cannot be enforced the person may be excommunicated or similar but if it decided to mete out violent laws such as the fatwa then it would be breaking uk laws itself and the persons doing such would be liable to prosecution

of course have you read any of this thread before this post

 to ignore the countrys laws in preference to religious laws which are not indigenous to the country in question is an absurd and arrogant notion

of course it is a sort of anarchism

anarchism is explicitly against islam

bobby mozumder describing problems with atheism

deletia  i dont understand the point of this petty sarcasm

it is a basic  principle of islam that if one is born muslim or one says i testify  that there is no god but god and mohammad is a prophet of god that  so long as one does not explicitly reject islam by word then one must  be considered muslim by all muslims

so the phenomenon youre attempting  to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic  islamic principles

if you want to attack islam you could do better than  than to argue against something that islam explicitly contradicts

in the deletions somewhere it mentioned something about chopping off of hands being a punishment for theft in saudi arabia

assuming this is so i wouldnt know and assuming it is done by people fitting your requirement for muslim which i find highly likely then would you please try to convince bobby mozumder that muslims chop peoples hands off

in article buedu jaegerbuphybuedu gregg jaeger writes well seeing as you are not muslim the sort of fatwa issued by khomeini would not be relevant to you

i can understand your fear of persecution and i share it even more than you being muslim however rushdies behavior was not completely excusable

why should a fatwa issued by khomeini be relevant to anyone who doesnt live in iran

issued by khomeini it shouldnt be relevant to anyone

but issued by an honest and learned scholar of islam it would be relevant to any muslim as it would be contrary to islamic law which all muslims are required to respect

 who is it that decides whether rushdies behavior is excusable

anyone sufficiently well versed in islamic law and capable of reasoning if you are talking about a weak sense of excuse

it depends on what sense of excuse you have in mind

tammy

so why do i read in the papers that the qumram texts had different versions of some ot texts

did i misunderstand

reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world

newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real story that is a bigger headline

lets back up to 

at this point we have the masoretic text the various targums translationscommentaries in aramaic etc and the septuagint the ancient greek translation

the masoretic text is the standard jewish text and essentially does not vary

in some places it has obvious corruptions all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy

these passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the septuagint

now the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars first it includes additional texts and second in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text in addition to fixingpredating the various corrupted passages

it must be emphasized that to the best of my knowledge these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars and have little theological import

the dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient copy of almost all of isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other ot books

there is also an abundance of other material but as far as i know there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha the extra texts in the septuagint

as far as analysis has proceeded there are also variations between the dss texts and the masoretic versions

these tend to reflect the septuagint where the latter isnt obviously in error

again though the differences thus far are not significant theologically

there is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material but so far this hasnt happened

the dss are important because there is almost no textual tradition in the ot unlike for the nt

i think that you are confusing the words objective and inherent

and objective system is simply one in which an outside observer who given the postulates of the system could perfectly judge any situation or action as consistent with the system right or not wrong

you seem to be objecting because the goals of the system are not inherent

that is you seem to want to define an objective system as one in which the postulates themselves could be determined by some outside observer

i dont think that this is a good definition of an objective system

then you need to learn english

really

gravity is an objective system

anybody can learn what it is and perform experiments

they will get the same results as every other person who has performed those experiments

no gravity is an inherent system

you dont need any excess information other than observations to determine anything

it is possible to objectively determine someones guilt or innocence within an noninherent system

i agree that morality is not necessarily inherent unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory

this natural morality is not an objective system as evidenced by your comments about lions and mine

perhaps it can be objective but not inherent

anyway as i noted before the practices related to mating rituals etc

among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions of the natural law

therefore some revisions are in order since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems

and in fact the only way that the postulates could be determined by an outsider would be if there were some sort of higher truth like some sort of god or something

but i do not think that a god is necessary for an objective system while it seems that you do

what are you trying to say here

it seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence which would necessitate some sort of grand design

no i have classified behavior of most animals as in line with a moral system

it is certainly possible for animals to commit acts which are outside of their rules of ethics but they dont seem to do so very often

perhaps they are not intelligent enough to be immoral

and perhaps its because you have yet to define a moral system

i think i have

it is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors etc

an immoral behavior could be unwanted unproductive or destructive etc depending on the goal of the system that is immoral to what end

benedikt rosenau writes with great authority   if it is contradictory it cannot exist

 contradictory is a property of language

if i correct this to   things defined by contradictory language do not exist  i will object to definitions as reality

if you then amend it to   things described by contradictory language do not exist  then weve come to something which is plainly false

failures in description are merely failures in description

how about this description an object that is at one time both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle

i hold that no object satisfying this description could exist

the description is inconsistent and hence describes an object that could not exist

now suppose someone pointed to a bicycle and said that object is at one time both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle

this does not mean that the bicycle does not exist it measn that the description was incorrectly applied

the atheist says the descriptions of god that i have been presented with are contradictory and hence describe something that cannot exist

now your position so far as i can gather is that god exists but the descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions of it

this is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle and when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one are told that it is a euclidean circlesquare

can they be blamed for doubting rather strongly that this bicycle exists at all

robert a heinlein

for several years ive periodically asked charley wingate to explain this mythical alternative to rationality which he propounds so enthusiastically when he pops up every few months

his reluctance to explain indicates to me that its not so hot 

ive said enough times that there is no alternative that should think you might have caught on by now

and there is no alternative but the point is rationality isnt an alternative either

the problems of metaphysical and religious knowledge are unsolvable or i should say humans cannot solve them

if there is truly no alternative then you have no basis whatsoever for your claim

the usual line here which you call a prejudgment of atheism and dispute is that reason is all we have

here you admit that you have no alternative no possible basis for the claim that there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in religious knowledge except possibly that reason conflicts with religious knowledge

this sounds very much like i cant provide a rational defense for my belief but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it may be false

i hope it makes you happy but your repeated and unfounded assertions to this effect dont advance your cause

jim perry perrydsinccom decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions

for a nominal fee they can be yours

i strongly suggest that you look up a book called the bible the quran and science by maurice baucaille a french surgeon

it is not comprehensive but it is well researched

i imagine your library has it or can get it for you through interlibrary loan

 i shall try to get hold of it when i have time to read of course  in short dr baucaille began investigating the bible because of pre ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies

he assumed that some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by gone days

so he read what he could find in hebrew greek aramaic

what he found was that the problems didnt go away they got worse

then he decided to see if other religions had the same problems

so he picked up the holy quran in french and found similar prob lems but not as many

so he applied the same logoic as he had with the bible he learned to read it in arabic

the problems he had found with the french version went away in arabic

he was unable to find a wealth of scientific statements in the holy quran but what he did find made sense with modern understanding

so he investigated the traditions the hadith to see what they had to say about science

they were filled with science problems after all they were contemporary narratives from a time which had by pour standards a primitive world view

his conclusion was that while he was impressed that what little the holy quran had to say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the holy quran did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in the traditions

how would a man of th century arabia have known what not to include in the holy quran assuming he had authored it

 so in short the writer or writers of quran decided to stay away from science

if you do not open your mouth then you dont put you foot into your mouth either

but then if you say quran does not talk much about science then one can not make claims like bobby does that you have great science in quran

basically i want to say that none of the religious texts are supposed to be scientific treatises

so i am just requesting the theists to stop making such wild claims

 in article cqavwgaustinibmcom karneraustinibmcom f karner writes    okay

so you want me to name names

there are obviously no official  records of these pseudomarriages because they are performed for  convenience

what happens typically is that the woman is willing to move  in with her lover without any scruples or legal contracts to speak of

 the man is merely utilizing a loophole by entering into a temporary  religious marriage contract in order to have sex

nobody complains  nobody cares nobody needs to know

   perhaps you should alert your imam

it could be that this practice is  far more widespread than you may think

or maybe it takes  muslim men  to witness the penetration to decide if the practice exists

      again you astound me with the level of ignorance you display muslims  are not allowed to enter temporary marriages got that

there is  no evidence for it it an outlawed practise so get your facts  straight buddy

give me references for it or just tell everyone you  were lying

it is not a widespread as you may think fantasise in  fact contrary to your fantasies it is not practised at all amongst  muslims

did you miss my post on this topic with the quote from the indonesian handbook and fred rices comments about temporary marriages

if so i will be glad to repost them

will you accept that it just may be a practice among some muslims if i do

or will you continue to claim that we are all lying and that it is not practised at all amongst muslims

i dont think f karner has to tell everyone anything

since you obviously know nothing about this practice there is very little you can contribute to the discussion except to accuse everyone of lying

i hope one day you will be old enough to understand what happened to your parents wrote patrick prevost

i loved your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred

police found the piece of paper near prevosts body in his apartment in northeast montreal

they say the yearold mechanic committed suicide after killing his wife jocelyne parent 

the couple had been separated for a month and the woman had gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money for food

a violent quarrel broke out and prevost attacked his wife with a kitchen knife cutting her throat police said

she was only the latest of  women slain by a husband or lover in quebec in the last five weeks

five children have also been slain as a result of the same domestic battles

last year in quebec alone  women were slain by their husbands

that was more than onethird of such cases across canada according to statistics from the canadian centre for justice

rest of article ommited then to say that women are somehow better or should be the one to stay home and raise a child is also laughable

women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family often more than men in many cultures throughout history

seems to me it takes at least two adults to raise a child and that both should stay home to do so

subject re feminism and islam again  in article apreaglewesleyanedu kmagnaccaeaglewesleyanedu writes  theres a way around that via the hadith which state that silence is taken to mean yes and that women may not speak before a judge who must conduct the marriage

  actaully thats a false hadith because it contradicts verses in the  quran that says women may testify speak before a judge

  hadiths are declared false when they contradict the quran

hadiths  werent written during the revelation or during the life of the prophet  and so may contain errors

so the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is if it contradicts the quran

what if it relates to something that isnt explicitly spelled out in the quran

also the quran wasnt written down during the life of muhammed either

mathew mathewmantiscouk writes perhaps we shouldnt imprision people if we could watch them closely instead

the cost would probably be similar especially if we just implanted some sort of electronic device

why wait until they commit the crime

why not implant such devices in potential criminals like communists and atheists

sorry i dont follow your reasoning

you are proposing to punish people before they commit a crime

what justification do you have for this

no mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism not treating the electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer

what he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals

this may not on the surface sound like a bad thing but who defines what a potential criminal is

if the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice this is not conducive to a free society

mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is

basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly therefore a deterrant to future offenders

mathew sees it most probably as a means of rehabilitation for the offender

so he was being cynical at you okay

jeff

jim you originally wrote  god did not create  disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns

   what god did create was life according to a protein code which is  mutable and can evolve

without delving into a deep discussion of  creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code  perfect and without flaw

     do you have any evidence for this

if the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour of this statement shouldnt we

perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of noncoding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions exons

an impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains

is the number of introns decreasing or increasing

it appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exonintron structure in their genes

on the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical difficulties

introns are removed by a splicing mechanism  this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted

moreover intron insertion would have required precise targeting  random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal selfsplicing of mrna are conserved

besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace  long terminal repeats and target  site duplications and these are not found in or near intron sequences

i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological arguments like this

try watsons molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish  baltimores molecular biology of the cell for starters

 remember the question was posed in a theological context why does  god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a  theological perspective  my own

it is no less valid than a purely  scientific perspective just different

scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion

 i think you misread my meaning

i said god made the genetic code perfect  but that doesnt mean its perfect now

it has certainly evolved since

for the worse

would you please cite a few references that support your assertion

your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence

in fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than weve thought  for instance sex might have evolved as defence against parasites

this view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg tierra

 perhaps

i thought it was higher energy rays like xrays gamma  rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage

in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action

 actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the  time when god created life

according to my recollection most  biologists do not claim that life began  billion years ago  after  all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth  was created

it would still be too primitive to support life

i  seem to remember a figure more like 

to  billion years ago for  the origination of life on earth

anyone with a better estimate

id replace created with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one

most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between 



billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but organic stromatolitelike layers date back to 

billion years

this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve

im sorry i cant give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here

 dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer  diseases both bacterialviral and genetic

although the forces of  natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the  degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this

again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration

i can understand scotts reaction   excuse me but this is so farfetched that i know you must be   jesting

do you know what pathogens are

do you know what   point mutations are

do you know that everything can come   about spontaneously

  in response to your last statement no and neither do you

 you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you  cannot know that

i hope you dont forget this we have evidence that suggests everything can come about spontaneously

do you have evidence against this conclusion

in science one does not have to believe in anything

it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve

but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present ones own conclusions prior to this

theology does not use this method

therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions

 human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely  affecting our wellbeing and ability to fight off disease while the  simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  causing infection and disease

it is a bad combination

hence  we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial  diseasesdisorders

you are supposing a purpose not a valid move

bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease

they are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution  only replication saves replicators from degradiation

we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate

the less efficient methods didnt make it to the present

and for the last time

please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes

some people have claimed that the opposite is true  we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade

i havent seen much evidence for either claim

 but then i ask so

where is this relevant to my discussion in  answering johns question of why

why are there genetic diseases  and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require  babies to develop antibodies

is it gods fault

the original  question  i say no it is not

of course nothing evil is gods fault

but your explanation does not work it fails miserably

 you may be right

but the fact is that you dont know that  satan is not responsible and neither do i   suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists

would it  be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills  that affect mankind

i dont think so

he could have done a much better job

pun intended

the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution

 did i say that

where

seems to me like another bad inference

 actually what youve done is to oversimplify what i said to the  point that your summary of my words takes on a new context

i  never said that people are meant presumably by god to be  punished by getting diseases

why i did say is that free moral  choices have attendent consequences

if mankind chooses to reject  god as people have done since the beginning then they should not  expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic  universe

i am not expecting this

if god exists i expect him to leave us alone

i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free

this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clearcut as it seems to be

what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah

 oh i admit its not perfect yet

but im working on it

 a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point

 what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the  question to which i provided an answer

biology and genetics are  fine subjects and important scientific endeavors

but they explain  how god created and set up life processes

they dont explain  the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution

why is there a why behind

and your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence

this is why we recommend these books

is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover

evidence for this

if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this

 thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice

but i am  not highly motivated to learn all the nittygritty details  of biology and genetics although im sure id find it a  fascinating subject

for i realize that the details do  not change the big picture that god created life in the  beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its  environment

im sorry but they do

there is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation

it can come into existence without a supreme being

in article qialfpmfidoasdsgicom liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes in article qieglhorusapmchpsnide frankdsuucp frank odwyer writes stuff deleted  to the newsgroup at large how about this for a deal recognise that what  happened in former communist russia has as much bearing on the validity  of atheism as has the doings of sundry theists on the validity of their  theism

thats zip nada none

the fallacy is known as ad hominem and  its an old one

it should be in the holy faq in the book of constructing  a logical argument   apart from not making a lot of sense this is wrong

there is no atheist creed that taught any communist what to do in the name of atheism

there clearly are theistic creeds and instructions on how to act for theists

they all madly conflict with one another but thats another issue

 lack of instructions on how to act might also be evil

thats like saying that since mathematics includes no instructions on how to act it is evil

atheism is not a moral system so why should it speak of instructions on how to act

atheism is simply lack of belief in god

plenty of theists think so

so one could argue the case for atheism causes whatever i didnt like about the former ussr with as much validity as theism causes genocide  that is to say no validity at all

i think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide

this is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide

however since the atheist set of instructions is the null set how can you show that atheism causes genocide

i really dont think you can imagine what it is like to be infinite

first of all infinity is a mathematical concept created by humans to explain certain things in a certain way

we dont know if it actually applies to reality we dont know if anything in the world is infinite

it wouldnt be able to comprehend what reality is like for the programmer because that would require an infinite memory or whatever because reality is continuous and based on infinietely small units no units

you dont know if the universe is actually continuous

continuum is another mathematical concept based on infinity used to explain things in a certain way

because humans do not know what infinite is

we call it something beyond numbers

we call it endless but we do not know what it is

i have a pretty good idea of what infinity is

its a manmade concept and like many manmade concepts it has evolved through time

ancient greeks had a different understanding of it

so we can call allah infinitely powerful knowledgeable etc yet we cannot imagine what allah actually is because we just cannot imagine what it is like to be infinite

precicely

we dont even know if infinity applies to reality

they said that the motto is but one of the little things you just contradicted yourself

the motto is one of those little things that nobody has bothered mentiopning to you huh

the little things above were in reference to germany clearly

people said that there were similar things in germany but no one could name any

they said that these were things that everyone should know and that they werent going to waste their time repeating them

sounds to me like no one knew either

i looked in some books but to no avail

that is going to pave the way for other intrusions

of course if the motto hasnt caused problems in its  year history then i doubt it is going to it has caused problems

you just ignore every instance when someone describes one to you

it has caused problems

again no one has shown that things were better before the motto or that theyd likely be better after

i dont think the motto initiates any sort of harassment

harassment will occur whether or not the motto is present

benedikt rosenau writes  and what about that revelation thing charley

 if youre talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well its obviously a risk one takes

ah now here is the core question

let me suggest a scenario

we will grant that a god exists and uses revelation to communicate with humans

said revelation taking the form paraphrased from your own words this infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck makes him take dictation and then hides away for a few hundred years

now there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation

this person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world which is all this person has ever seen but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation

now based on this can this person be blamed for concluding absent a personal revelation of their own that there is almost certainly nothing to this revelation thing

im not an objectivist so im not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization

the problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience

one can get some rough understanding but the language is from the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the perspective of whats being described rather inexact to be charitable

 an analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is that the better descriptive language is not available

absent this better language and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing

here is what i am driving at i have thought a long time about this

i have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that i am familiar with

now if there does happen to be say a christian god will i be held accountable for such an honest mistake

how do you know its based on ignorance couldnt that be wrong

why would it be wrong to fall into the trap that you mentioned

natural morality may specifically be thought of as a code of ethics that a certain species has developed in order to survive

wait

are we talking about ethics or morals here

is the distinction important

we see this countless times in the animal kingdom and such a natural system is the basis for our own system as well

huh

well our moral system seems to mimic the natural one in a number of ways

in order for humans to thrive we seem to need to live in groups heres your problem

we seem to need

whats wrong with the highlighted word

i dont know

what is wrong

is it possible for humans to survive for a long time in the wild

yes its possible but it is difficult

humans are a social animal and that is a cause of our success

and in order for a group to function effectively it needs some sort of ethical code

this statement is not correct

isnt it

why dont you think so

and by pointing out that a species conduct serves to propogate itself i am not trying to give you your tautology but i am trying to show that such are examples of moral systems with a goal

propogation of the species is a goal of a natural system of morality

so anybody who lives in a monagamous relationship is not moral

after all in order to ensure propogation of the species every man should impregnate as many women as possible

no

as noted earlier lack of mating such as abstinence or homosexuality isnt really destructive to the system

it is a worst neutral

for that matter in herds of horses only the dominate stallion mates

when he diesis killedwhatever the new dominate stallion is the only one who mates

these seems to be a case of your natural system of morality trying to shoot itself in the figurative foot

again the mating practices are something to be reexamined keith

 first i want to start right out and say that im a christian

it makes sense to be one

have any of you read tony campollos book liar lunatic or the real thing

i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book

anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself

sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy

just what organization did he belong to

does it have a name

 the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was

logic alert  artificial trifercation

the are many other possible explainations

could have been that he never existed

there have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths mithra comes to mind

 some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows

who would die for a lie

wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar

people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed

call me a fool but i believe he did heal people

logic alert  argument from incredulity

just because it is hard for you to believe this doesnt mean that it isnt true

liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself site

he has followers that dont think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die

by not giving up after getting shot himself koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes

as far as healing goes

if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels

in one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today

seems to me that the early gospels werent that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better

 niether was he a lunatic

would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy

very doubtful in fact rediculous

for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away

 therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing

or might not have existed or any number of things

that is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into

there are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible

once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives

however if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices

i have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he isnt one of the other two alternative is no longer valid

 some other things to note

he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone

this in his betrayal and crucifixion

i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it

jc was a rabbi

he knew what those prophecies were

it wouldnt be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy

what would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then yet fullfilled them anyway

 i dont think most people understand what a christian is

it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches

rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for gods sake

he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same

hey we cant do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him

thats tuff and most people dont want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at

but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time

we dont rush it in one day christianity is your whole life

it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while

we box everything into time units

such as work at this time sports tv social life

god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves

here i agree with you

anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life

i have very little respect for xians that dont

if the myth is true then it is true in its entirity

  i accept nothing on blind faith

  invisible pink flying unicorns

need i say more

  i harbor no beliefs at all there is no good evidence for god  existing or not

some folks call this agnosticism

it does not suffer  from blind faith at all

i think of it as dont worry be happy

  for many atheists the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an  epistemological consideration what do we accept as a reliable way of  knowing

there are no known valid logical arguments for the existence  of gods nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist

most  philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that  must be accepted on faith

faith is belief without a sound logical  basis or empirical evidence

it is a reliable way of knowing

 could you expand on your definition of knowing

it seems a bit monolithic here but im not sure that you intend that

dont we need for example to distinguish between knowing  plus  equals  or  apples plus  apples equals  apples the french knowing that jerry lewis is an auteur and what it means to say we know what socrates said

 this is patently absurd but whoever wishes to become a philosopher  must learn not to be frightened by absurdities

 in article iiibwwmantiscouk  tony lezard tonymantiscouk writes   deletion    my opinion is that the strong atheist position requires too much  belief for me to be comfortable with

any strong atheists out there  care to comment

  humans just come up with the idea of a spiritual parent

it is one  of the artifacts of human thought

the evidence for that is quite  overwhelming

and the information content of the conceived is vanishing

  in other words if there were gods they would hardly make sense and  it is possible to explain the phenomenon of religion without gods

  the concept is useless and i dont have to introduce new assumptions  in order to show that

  no leap of faith required for me

your mileage may vary

yes i fully agree with that but is it i dont believe gods exist or i believe no gods exist

as mandtbackafinaboabofi mats andtbacka pointed out it all hinges on what you take the word believe to mean

unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism at least according to the faq  atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god

 some atheists go further and believe that god does not exist

the former is  often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong  atheism

  it is important to note the difference between these two positions

weak  atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god

strong  atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist

please do not  fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists

from mathews an introduction to atheism version

bobby  i would like to take the liberty to quote from a christian writer named ellen g white

i hope that what she said will help you to edit your remarks in this group in the future

 do not set yourself as a standard

do not make your opinions your views of duty your interpretations of scripture a criterion for others and in your heart condemn them if they do not come up to your ideal

 thoughts fromthe mount of blessing p   i hope quoting this doesnt make the atheists gag but i think ellen white put it better than i could

 tammy  point

 peace  bobby mozumder  my point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe

saying that all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups

i see in your posts a spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don t believe exactly as you do

if youre here to try to convert the atheists here youre failing miserably

who wants to be in position of constantly defending themselves agaist insulting attacks like you seem to like to do

im sorry youre so blind that you didnt get the messgae in the quote everyone else has seemed to

tammy

it appears that walla walla college will fill the same role in altatheist that allegheny college fills in altfandanquayle

 first i want to start right out and say that im a christian

it makes sense to be one

have any of you read tony campollos book liar lunatic or the real thing

i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book

anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself

converts to xtianity have this tendency to excessively darken their prextian past frequently falsely

anyone who embarks on an effort to destroy xtianity is suffering from deep megalomania a defect which is not cured by religious conversion

 the arguements he uses i am summing up

the book is about whether jesus was god or not

i know many of you dont believe but listen to a different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what others have to say

different perspective

different perspective

bwahahahahahahahah

 the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was

sigh

perhaps big j was just mistaken about some of his claims

perhaps he was normally insightful but had a few off days

perhaps many most

of the statements attributed to jesus were not made by him but were put into his mouth by later authors

other possibilities abound

surely someone seriously examining this question could come up with a decent list of possible alternatives unless the task is not serious examination of the question much less destroying xtianity but rather religious salesmanship

 some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows

who would die for a lie

how many germans died for nazism

how many russians died in the name of the proletarian dictatorship

how many americans died to make the world safe for democracy

what a silly question

wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar

people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed

call me a fool but i believe he did heal people

is everyone who performs a healing  god

 niether was he a lunatic

would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy

its probably hard to draw an entire nation to you unless you are crazy

very doubtful in fact rediculous

for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away

 therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing

anyone who is convinced by this laughable logic deserves to be a xtian

 some other things to note

he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone

this in his betrayal and crucifixion

i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it

dont bother

many of the prophecies were fulfilled only in the eyes of xtian apologists who distort the meaning of isaiah and other ot books

in article aprbradfordacuk lnewnhambradfordacuk leonard newnham writes deletions argument from incredulity has not been considered a valid form of  reasoning since medieval times

deletions interesting that you should mention that argument from incredulity has not been considered a valid form of reasoning since medieval times

i quite agree

why then do some atheists here engage in it

more than a few times i have read posts where the atheists posting state that they cannot see how a gracious and loving god can allow such evil and suffering to occur as we see on the earth

simply because they cannot envision it it must not be true

if this is not an argument from incredulity i dont know what is

as you have presented it it is indeed an argument from incredulity

however from what i have seen it is not often presented in this manner

it is usually presented more in the form and besides i cannot see nor have i ever been offered a convincing explanation

moreover it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such phenomena

that theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not an argument in theisms favor

especially when different theisms offer different explanations and even different adherents of what is purportedly the same theism give different explanations  god has far more complex motivations and reasons for action or nonaction than to simply fix evil whenever and however it occurs or even before it occurs

and yet it is this very same argument from incredulity which ranks high among reasons why atheists in general reject god and in particular the christian god

not im my experience

in my experience the most common reason is the lack of evidence in theisms favor

you mileage may vary

 this seems to be the universal bane of human reasoning and rationality to wit that it is far easier to see the logical fallacy or inept reasoning on the part of ones opponents than it is to see it in oneself

oh heck ill be snide this once

 its also fairly easy to attack arguments that are not made

naren narentekigpentekcom all standard disclaimers apply

  i dont understand the point of this petty sarcasm

it is a basic  principle of islam that if one is born muslim or one says i testify  that there is no god but god and mohammad is a prophet of god that  so long as one does not explicitly reject islam by word then one must  be considered muslim by all muslims

so the phenomenon youre attempting  to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic  islamic principles

if you want to attack islam you could do better than  than to argue against something that islam explicitly contradicts

 then mr mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing bad acts people temporarily become atheists

 jon

of course bm

is not incorrect

he is defending islam

when defending islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you

but when an atheist uses the same argument he is using petty sarcasm

so bm

can have his temporary atheists whenever he needs them and all the temporary atheists can later say that they were always good muslims because they never explicitly rejected islam

temporary atheism temporary islam temporary marriage

liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes  well chimps must have some system

they live in social groups as we do so they must have some laws dictating undesired behavior

so why must they have such laws

 the quotation marks should enclose laws not must

 if there were no such rules even instinctive ones or unwritten ones etc then surely some sort of random chance would lead a chimp society into chaos

the system refered to a moral system

you havnt shown any reason that chimps must have a moral system

except if you would like to redefine everything

whatever promises that have been made can than be broken

 one is perfectly free to be muslim and to doubt and question the  existence of god so long as one does not reject god

i am sure that  rushdie has be now made his atheism clear in front of a sufficient  number of proper witnesses

the question in regard to the legal issue  is his status at the time the crime was committed

p pyou think i should just accept this

p pthis isnt particularly a dig at fundamentalist christians

i have been ptold on altatheism that i reject allah because i am too proud to embrace pislam and that i reject krishna because my eyes are closed

but most of pthe religious nuts who post on altatheism are some kind of militant pchristian who cant accept that others dont share their beliefs

this pkind of stuff should be kept on talkreligionmisc where it belongs

p patheism isnt a belief its the absence of belief in any gods

p  p pdo you have a problem with this

p p pbill pfirst i would like to say that atheism is in fact a belief

it is a beilief pbecause a belief in something you hold to with ador and faith

an atheist says there are no gods

this cannot be proven

therefore you are excepting this on pfaith alone

that is a belief

secondly you complain so much about how the pfundamental christians are trying to force their beliefs on you but you dont pmention anything about how the atheists such as madamme murry oharefounder pof the atheists association in austin texas and robert shermanfrom the chicago area have been trying to force their beliefs on everyone by trying to get rid of god from our society by banning religious paintings from parks during chistmas forcing cities to change their town seals if there is any mention of god in it like sherman has done or trying to get the slogan in god we trust off of the american currency

you also talk about creation myths as if they are in fact myths and tha p p p phave concrete evidece of this

you probably pdont and that just enforces my point that your atheism is just as much belief as my christianity

if this is not so please do show me why it isnt

pmark covalt the only real problem i have with the argument of christianity is that they seem to ignore their origin that being asiatic in origin

the flatearthers state that the earth is flat is a fact

i dont accept this i think its an unproven opinion and i think the roundearthers are right because they have better evidence than the flatearthers do

although i cant prove that a god doesnt exist the arguments used to support a gods existence are weak and often selfcontradictory and im not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that i absolutely cant ignore

a while ago i read an interesting book by a fellow called von daenicken in which he proved some of the wildest things and on the last page he wrote something like can you prove it isnt so

i certainly cant but im not going to believe him because he based his proof on some really questionable stuff such as old myths he called it circumstancial evidence

my case is that everything wrong in the world will end if people start believing in islam

and that horrors to mankind are all caused by the lack of belief atheism

for the last time bobby

lack of belief in your god does not imply atheism

just because some moslems arent moral does not mean they dont believe in a god named allah although their allah may not do the things your allah does

if a moslem says heshe believes that a god exists heshe is a theist though maybe not a true follower of islam

  if it is contradictory it cannot exist

 contradictory is a property of language

if i correct this to    things defined by contradictory language do not exist  no need to correct it it stands as it is said

i will object to definitions as reality

if you then amend it to   things described by contradictory language do not exist  then weve come to something which is plainly false

failures in description are merely failures in description

 you miss the point entirely

things defined by contradictory language do not exist

though something existing might be meant conclusions drawn from the description are wrong unless there is the possibility to find the described and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of the described then

another possibility is to drop the contradictory part but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented and that one has not got to doubt the source of it as well

im not an objectivist remember

 neither am i

but either things are directly sensed which includes some form of modelling by the way or they are used in modelling

using something contradictive in modelling is not approved of

wonder why

we remain with the question if something contradictory can be sensed as contradictory

an important point is that either one manages to resolve the contradictions or one is forced not to use or to refer to the contradictory part in drawing conclusions or one will fall in the garbage in garbage out trap

in aprbmwmayoedu vdpmayoedu vinayak dutt writes so instead of calling it interest on deposits you call it returns on investements and instead of calling loans you call it investing in business that is in other words floating stocks in your company

 no interest is different from a return on an investment

for one thing a return on an investment has greater risk and not a set return ie

the amount of money you make can go up or down or you might even lose money

the difference is the risk of loss is shared by the investor rather than practically all the risk being taken by the borrower when the borrower borrows from the bank

 but is it different from stocks 

if you wish to call an investor in stocks as a banker well then its your choice  relabeling does not make it interest free 

 it is not just relabeling as i have explained above

it is relabeling  also its still not interest free

the investor is still taking some money  as dividend on his investment  ofcourse the investor in islamic banking its your so called bank is taking more risk than the usual bank but its still getting some thing back in return  also have you heard of junk bonds

in article phpeinngdsidsinccom perrydsinccom jim perry writes  disclaimer im speaking from the jewish perspective  where the bible means what many call the old testament  and where the interpretation is not necessarily the  raw text but instead the court cases commentaries  and traditions passed down through jewish communities

  this seems the crux to me if you judge the bible according to a long  line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day  rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact then of course  it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values 

but if thats how the bible is actually being used today shouldnt that be how we should judge it

if most people use scissors to cut paper shouldnt consumers reports test scissors for papercutting ability even though scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth

thats possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teaching jewish morality today but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highlyinterpreted version is what was enlightened for its times

to attempt to extend the analogy this is like saying that the original scissormakers were unusually advanced at papercutting for their times even though they only ever cut cloth and had never even heard of paper

im not arguing that the bible is disgusting though some of the history depicted in it is by modern standards

however history is full of similar abuses and i dont think the biblical accounts are worse than their contemporariesor possibly ours

on the other hand i dont know of any reason to think the history described in the bible shows less abuse than their contemporaries or ours

that complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting but i still dont think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history

jim perry perrydsinccom decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions

for a nominal fee they can be yours

this whole thread started because of a discussion about whether or not the death penalty constituted cruel punishment which is forbidden by the us constitution

yes but they didnt say what they meant by cruel which is why a you have the supreme court and b it makes no sense to refer to the constitution which is quite silent on the meaning of the word cruel

they spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the constitution

they picked words whose meanings implied the intent

we have already looked in the dictionary to define the word

isnt this sufficient

oh but we were discussing the death penalty and that discussion resulted from the one about murder which resulted from an intial discussion about objective moralityso this is already three times removed from the morality discussion

actually we were discussing the mening of the word cruel and the us constitution says nothing about that

but we were discussing it in relation to the death penalty

and the constitution need not define each of the words within

anyone who doesnt know what cruel is can look in the dictionary and we did

  personally i feel that since religion have such a poweful  psychological effect we should let theists be

but the problem is that  religions cause enormous harm to nonbelievers and to humanity as a whole  holy wars inquisitions interreligious hatred impedence of science   intellectual progress usthem attitudes etc etc

need i say more

 i really dont know what we can do about them

any comments

 i have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax anybody else

this seems to be ok for atheists

you dont get an atheist knocking on your door stopping you in the airport or handing out literature at a social event

theists seem to think that thier form of happy should work for others and try to make it so

dave fuller dfullerportalhqvideocartcom

no thats just what you thought the theory meant

while all humans are generally capable of overpowering their instincts it does not follow that those who do this often are necessarily more intelligent

ok so why arent animals generally capable of overpowering their instincts

good question

im sure some biologist could answer better than i but animals brains are just set up differently

animals can be trained but if theyre instincts serve them well there is no reason to contradict them

deletion  i will argue that your latter statement i believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith  that is if you are making a positive statement that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i dont know and therefore dont believe in them and dont not believe in then weak atheism

once again to not believe in god is different than saying i believe that god does not exist

i still maintain the position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires faith

 no it in the way it is usually used

in my view you are saying here that driving a car requires faith that the car drives

for me it is a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i have in the premises and the argument used

but first let me say the following

we might have a language problem here  in regards to faith and existence

i as a christian maintain that god does not exist

to exist means to have being in space and time

god does not have being  god is being

kierkegaard once said that god does not exist he is eternal

with this said i feel its rather pointless to debate the so called existence of god  and that is not what im doing here

i believe that god is the source and ground of being

when you say that god does not exist i also accept this statement  but we obviously mean two different things by it

however in what follows i will use the phrase the existence of god in its usual sense  and this is the sense that i think you are using it

i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god

 no thats a word game

the term god is used in a different way usually

when you use a different definition it is your thing but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way i define god is  and that does not exist it is existence itself so i say it does not exist

interestingly there are those who say that existence exists is one of the indubitable statements possible

further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete making it a fallacy

deletion one can never prove that god does or does not exist

when you say that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation i will have to ask what observtions are you refering to

there are no observations  pro or con  that are valid here in establishing a positive belief

deletion where does that follow

arent observations based on the assumption that something exists

and wouldnt you say there is a level of definition that the assumption god is is meaningful

if not i would reject that concept anyway

so where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some level

organization penn state university from secpsuvmpsuedu subject why the bible

lines  one thing i think is interesting about altathiesm is the fact that without biblethumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup

it almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to tear apart

oh well that little tidbit aside here is what i really wanted write about

how can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible

if you want to be religious arent there more plausable books out there

seriously the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other

one minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next it says not to kill at all

i think that if xtians really want to follow a deity they should pick one that can be consistent unlike the last one they invented

for people who say jesus was the son of god didnt god say not to ever put anyone else before him

looks like you did just that

didnt god say not to make any symbols or idols

what are crosses then

dont you think that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track

was jesus illiterate

why didnt he write anything

anyone know

i honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot

the only reason xtianity escaped the middle east is because a certain roman whos wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome xtian after a bad dream

    orthodox christian theology states that god created lucifer satan  along with the other angels presumably because he wanted beings to  celebrate glorify existence and life and thereby god along with  him

actually the whys and wherefores of gods motivations for  creating the angels are not a big issue within christian theology

  but god created lucifer with a perfect nature and gave him along with  the other angels free moral will

lucifer was a high angel perhaps  the highest with great authority

it seems that his greatness caused  him to begin to take pride in himself and desire to be equal to or  greater than god

he forgot his place as a created being

he exalted  himself above god and thereby evil and sin entered creation

actually the story goes that lucifer refused to bow before man as god commanded him to

lucifer was devoted to god

oh yeah there is nothing in genesis that says the snake was anything more than a snake well a talking onehad legs at the time too

i dont think pointing out contradictions in stories is the best way to show the error in theology if they think a supernatural entity kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a fruit that gave them special powerswell they might not respond well to reason and logic

many people would probably think especially if the fanatics propogandized this that this was a conflict between the atheists and the religious

many would get the impression that we were trying to outlaw religion if we contintue to try to remove all things with a religious reference

thats not what the people ive asked think

perhaps you would be right if you said the fundamentalists would think this way after all they think they are being oppressed when they are not allowed to oppress

however you have not shown where you get this idea that many people would probably think its atheism vs religion winner take all

as far as i can tell it is your groundless prediction that this will happen

but you havent taken into the account of propoganda

remember if you asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at least some were able to tolerate it

you see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy

the propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues including abortion and gays look at some of the things that have happened

well so far they have passed one amendment which is currently under intense scrutiny and they have failed to outlaw abortion which is their prime goal on that issue

yep they seem sooo effective

sure

well they havent managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts

but they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion

they could create similar problems for us

and it could be worse

they can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics etc but imagine what theyd have to do to stop atheism

besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people

better than your one that is your opinion

also i have branched out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now

and what have they said

were you questions unbiased

keith you would claim that my questions are biased the minute i posted them because the answers agreed with me

everyone i have asked about the possible removal of the motto the christian portion has expressed regret about its loss because they like it

however when it is pointed out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claimed

so you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them

a whole nation

as for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto

some noted being harassed by christians who used the motto to try to seem justified

and all would see it gone

yes id be glad if it were gone to

ive never supported it

however i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted with what could happen an what may be likely

which christians designed the motto

does the motto say anything about jesus

why do you think that it refers only to christians

christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and all others are wrong therefore why would they include other religions in the realm of being correct

i doubt that any other religions were meant to be included

well i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key the motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed in a god

and surely there are a few christians that think as you say but i dont think that most do

do you think that all christians actively despise other religions

most that i have met havent and dont do so

no christian that i have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them

why not ask some people of other faiths

sorry i would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here

suppose you could ask a few people

well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and all of them think that it is applicable to them

of course i cant say that these people just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their faiths

it is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any given issue

you are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing leads to this conclusion

without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there were dissenting opinions

you claim there were

provide some evidence for your assertion

well id really like to and ive tried but i really dont know where to get access to congressional records from the s can anyone help out here

comparing christians to nazis

interesting

only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs

no again the motto on the money doesnt cost you anything extra

however if you abolished the motto wed all have to pay to have all the dies and plates redone

like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them

you now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again

 also i doubt that they use th same plates for more than a years printing this would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next years plates without it

your claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere

provide some evidence for this assertion

so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year

anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted i see was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money

this is just not correct

the ones i read didnt mention anything about jesus

i think the issue was concerning the distinction between religion and not

how could it be between religious and not religious

the motto refers to god it is a religious motto

the question is whether or not it is only christian

you say it is more

i doubt this

provide some evidence for this assertion

that is to say the religion of this country and the nonreligion of the ussr

that was what most of those quotes were about and some included all atheists in general as well

i dont think that any of the quotes although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus

they advocated religion over nonreligion

a specific religion was not mentioned

you have missed this point

i said that the motto didnt say anything about anyone in particular

that is the motto doesnt imply anything about your particular beliefs

it doesnt say that everyone trusts in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does

we have been through this before

its obvious it does not include me this much is beyond doubt

your claim again is that the motto refers to more than christians

based on the facts that christianity says all other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was written by christians i doubt your claim

so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong

thats silly

i think the flatearthers are wrong but i dont advocate their banishment

 based on this idea i doubt that any additional expense would even be incurred by removing the motto

provide some evidence for your claim that it would

i think that any such cost would be insignificant

i mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency

disregarding the digression of the other mottoif it is used for harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should it not be removed

well mottos in general dont really have purposes

i dont think it should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences

and do you know what the vote was

were there other opinions

do you think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother atheists

do you think that this is what the majority of congress at the time had in mind

if you do then show why

again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that i am concerned with

then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress

again it is not necessary that the complete majority shared the purpose of confronting godless communism with this motto

why not

it is the majority that put it there

the general public probably does not know about the antiatheist intent of a few people in the s either

i daresay more people remember the s than the time when key wrote the anthem

but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto

do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists

why dont you include this in your little survey that you were conducting

 you claim here that scientists would believe someones claims

i doubt this

provide evidence for your assertion

what

should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein said about relativity is worthy

i mean if einstein said it theres a good chance that it was right at least at the time

as for the courts the method scientists use can be applied

i need not agree with the court by default because of a good record

you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point

what

but you said you didnt agree with the court because they allowed congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning

if you dont realize that something like this is external to the realm of the courts power then how can i be confident that you know anything about the courts powers

i mean if you dont know how the court works how can you participate in a discussion of the court

a judge can go to speak before congress

and still you ignore the abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion

no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a constitutional amendment

and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be presented

mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever the analogy is the same

just because something that i might find offensive is present doesnt mean that my rights are being violated

we are talking about something put there by people keithnot a mushroom

no one caused that mushroom to exist unless youre finding things offensive in a mushroom farm

yes some mushrooms can be planted

and i dont appreciate mushrooms on my pizza either

this is not the case with the motto

and youre ignoring the harassment which is the only known result of the motto and youre ignoring that somewhere along the line people were forced to put the motto there

who was forced to put the motto there

what do you mean

keith

perhaps the chimps that failed to evolve cooperative behaviour died out and we are left with the ones that did evolve such behaviour entirely by chance

thats the entire point

are you going to proclaim a natural morality every time an organism evolves cooperative behaviour

yes

natural morality is a morality that developed naturally

what about the natural morality of bee dance

huh

keith

this whole thread started because of a discussion about whether or not the death penalty constituted cruel punishment which is forbidden by the us constitution

yes but they didnt say what they meant by cruel which is why a you have the supreme court and b it makes no sense to refer to the constitution which is quite silent on the meaning of the word cruel

 they spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the constitution

they picked words whose meanings implied the intent

we have already looked in the dictionary to define the word

isnt this sufficient

we only need to ask the question what did the founding fathers consider cruel and unusual punishment

hanging

hanging there slowing being strangled would be very painful both physically and psychologicall i imagine

firing squad 

 note not a clean way to die back in those days  etc

all would be considered cruel under your definition

all were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers

whatever promises that have been made can than be broken

john laws a man without the honor to keep his given word

  ill take a wild guess and say freedom is objectively valuable

i base  this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly  of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition  almost all would want to complain

therefore i take it that to assert or  believe that freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see  that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on  a rainy day

i take this to be a candidate for an objective value and it  it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values  such as this exist

my own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom is a good thing

however when i here people assert that the only true freedom is in following the words of this and that messiah i realise that people dont even agree on the meaning of the word

what does it mean to say that word x represents an objective value when word x has no objective meaning

 the probability that the automobile system will kill someone  innocent in an accident goes asymptotically close to  just  like the court system

however anyone who doesnt like the automobile system can opt out as i have

this isnt true

many people are forced to use the automobile system

i certainly dont use it by choice

if there were other ways of getting around id do it

secondly we do try to make the automobile system as safe as possible because we do recognize the danger to the innocent whereas the us  the current example  is not trying to make the court system safer which it could fairly easily do by replacing fatal punishments with nonfatal punishments

but i think that the court system has been refinedover hundreds of years in the us britain and other countries

we have tried to make it as fair as possible

can it be made better without removing the death penalty

besides life imprisonment sounds like a fatal punishment to me

from nyedacnsvaxuwecedu david nye subject re radical agnostic not

organization university of wisconsin eau claire lines  reply to zazenaustinibmcom e h welbon  there is no means that i can possibly think of to prove beyond doubt that a god does not exist but if anyone has one by all means tell me what it is

therefore lacking this ability of absolute proof being an atheist becomes an act of faith in and of itself and this i cannot accept

 i accept nothing on blind faith

invisible pink flying unicorns

need i say more

i harbor no beliefs at all there is no good evidence for god existing or not

some folks call this agnosticism

it does not suffer from blind faith at all

i think of it as dont worry be happy

for many atheists the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing

there are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist

most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith

faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence

it is a reliable way of knowing

there is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof

even when we agree to take someone elses word on faith we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past we judge him likely to be a reliable source now

if we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods

the difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing rather than as some agnostic posters would have it whether ones faith is in gods or no gods

the theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times for example in his work as a scientist

the atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge

agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge

without evidence why should we believe in gods rather than santa claus or the easter bunny

i would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesnt require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods

i dont believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge

atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the lack of facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found

this is very comfortable for youimagine never having to entertain an argument against your belief system

simply accuse the person making of being a bigot

well this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over into altatheism where we spend most of our time entertaining arguments against our belief system without resorting to accusing others of bigotry

its somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in recscouting since i always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity

i understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race religion ethnic background sex or other inconsequential characteristics

all the evidence ive seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics

thus pending further evidence i conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory

supersedes mantiscouk lines  archivename atheismintroduction altatheismarchivename introduction lastmodified  april  version 

begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew mathewmantiscouk this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism

whilst i have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint

i would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some relevant books are listed in a companion article

to provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist

all the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created

some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article

please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a christian viewpoint

this is because the faq files reflect questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christians who proselytize on altatheism

so when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such as christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine being

much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it may not

what is atheism

atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god

some atheists go further and believe that god does not exist

the former is often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism

it is important to note the difference between these two positions

weak atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god

strong atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist

please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists

some atheists believe in the nonexistence of all gods others limit their atheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than making flatout denials

but isnt disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesnt exist

definitely not

disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true

not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not

which brings us to agnosticism

what is agnosticism then

the term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the metaphysical society in 

he defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable

thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether god exists

words are slippery things and language is inexact

beware of assuming that you can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic

for example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism

beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it is very difficult to generalize about atheists

about all you can say for sure is that atheists dont believe in god

for example it certainly isnt the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe

so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism

there are many philosophical justifications for atheism

to find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask her

many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions is essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible that such a god could exist

others are atheists through scepticism because they see no evidence that god exists

but isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of something

there are many counterexamples to such a statement

for example it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers

of course this deals with welldefined objects obeying welldefined rules

whether gods or universes are similarly welldefined is a matter for debate

however assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence of god

if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexample

if on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found to show that it isnt there

such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible

there is no such problem with largest primes because we can prove that they dont exist

therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do

even theists follow this rule most of the time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere

to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested

we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he doesnt exist anywhere

so the sceptical atheist assumes by default that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can test

those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of god described by followers of various religions

so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may be possible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religious book does not exist

it may even be possible to prove that no god described by any presentday religion exists

in practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no god exists

however it is sufficiently different that counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of god are not really applicable

but what if god is essentially nondetectable

if god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interaction must be measurable

hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable

if god is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way

many atheists would argue that if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of no importance whether he exists or not

if the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelites

surely he should still be detectable today

note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way

it must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish him from all the other things that dont exist

ok you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but isnt it still a religious belief

one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game

the cynical view of this game is as follows person a begins by making a contentious statement

when person b points out that it cant be true person a gradually redefines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept

he then records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed to it and continues

eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it

rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play along

the point of this digression is that the answer to the question isnt atheism a religious belief

depends crucially upon what is meant by religious

religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power  especially in some sort of god  and by faith and worship

 its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition 

atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense

widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well  such as science politics and watching tv

ok so its not a religion

but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion is

firstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in

secondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience

most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt

science has a number of core assumptions

for example it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers

these are the sort of core assumptions atheists make

if such basic ideas are called acts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith and the term loses its meaning

faith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in something

according to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith

of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain

this is not a general tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists

faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof

sceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheism has no beliefs

strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when asserting that god does not exist

if atheism is not religious surely its antireligious

it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy

the truth is not so clearcut

atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that sense it can be said to be antireligion

however when religious believers speak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists

this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair

atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum

most atheists take a live and let live attitude

unless questioned they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends

of course this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries

a few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert others when possible

historically such antireligious atheists have made little impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries

to digress slightly the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state just like the usa

soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished

the institution of state atheism came about when stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population

some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business  for example the government of the usa

such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate

but if you dont allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely thats the same as state atheism

the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief

in particular it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature

religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters

for example religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms

even today many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns

so long as they campaign concerning secular matters and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say

what about prayer in schools

if theres no god why do you care if people pray

because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do things that those who dont pray cant just ignore

also christian prayer in schools is intimidating to nonchristians even if they are told that they need not join in

the diversity of religious and nonreligious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event

also nonprayers tend to have friends and family who pray

it is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time even without other motives

you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid

what about atheists

why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals

dont atheists object to the religious charities

there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to

some atheists contribute to religious charities as well for the sake of the practical good they do

some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis

most atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about in connection with charity

to them atheism is just a simple obvious everyday matter and so is charity

many feel that its somewhat cheap not to say selfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs

to weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is a rather strange idea its rather like holding a party to say today is not my birthday

why the fuss

atheism is rarely evangelical

you said atheism isnt antireligious

but is it perhaps a backlash against ones upbringing a way of rebelling

perhaps it is for some

but many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists

its also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different

on the other hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others

on the whole we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently

how do atheists differ from religious people

they dont believe in god

thats all there is to it

atheists may listen to heavy metal  backwards even  or they may prefer a verdi requiem even if they know the words

they may wear hawaiian shirts they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes

many buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god

some atheists even carry a copy of the bible around  for arguing against of course

whoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it

atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance

unexceptional

but arent atheists less moral than religious people

that depends

if you define morality as obedience to god then of course atheists are less moral as they dont obey any god

but usually when one talks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society

humans are social animals and to be maximally successful they must cooperate with each other

this is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposes of selfpreservation

many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans

so why do they care what happens to others

they dont know they simply are that way

naturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions

however there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions

for example here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance jesus christ came into the world to save sinners

but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life

now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever

the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th  by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin

it seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is a religious massmurderer

but what of more trivial morality

a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences

while only  of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again  had done so after conversion

similarly  had used illegal drugs before conversion  after

two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation  after

freethought today september  p



so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour

is there such a thing as atheist morality

if you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then the answer is yes as explained above

many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people

if you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer is no

atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave

most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists but for different reasons

atheists view morality as something created by humans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being

then arent atheists just theists who are denying god

a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over  of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them

they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them

atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they are unbelievers through choice

the vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth

they have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs

this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individuals personality

for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make

but dont atheists want to believe in god

atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them

many of them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured the big brother figure might be

some atheists would like to be able to believe in god  but so what

should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true

the risks of such an approach should be obvious

atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough there must be evidence for the belief

but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god  they are unwilling in their souls to see

many if not most atheists were previously religious

as has been explained above the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god exists

many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god

of course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedminded

comments such as of course god is there you just arent looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing

certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for god

if you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate is futile

isnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist

many atheists live a purposeful life

they decide what they think gives meaning to life and they pursue those goals

they try to make their lives count not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on other people who will live on

for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leaving his mark on history

it is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events

however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning

to put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask

some atheists believe that asking what is the meaning of life

is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup of coffee

they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just is

so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger

there are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even pets

or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv

that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what

should individuals believe in things because they are comforting or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be

in the end its a decision for the individual concerned

most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable

they put truth before comfort and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats just hard luck

dont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong

the short answer is no do you

many atheists have been atheists for years

they have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive

thousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof of the existence of god

atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about it

so why should theists question their beliefs

dont the same arguments apply

no because the beliefs being questioned are not similar

weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing

strong atheism is a negative belief

theism is a very strong positive belief

atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause  not just to the believers but to everyone else

what sort of harm

religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind

its not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings think of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so on

imagine how that effort could be better spent

many theists believe in miracle healing

there have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result

some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds

it is arguable that the catholic churchs opposition to birth control  and condoms in particular  is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many thirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of aids worldwide

religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion

those werent real believers

they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse

what makes a real believer

there are so many one true religions its hard to tell

look at christianity there are many competing groups all convinced that they are the only true christians

sometimes they even fight and kill each other

how is an atheist supposed to decide whos a real christian and who isnt when even the major christian churches like the catholic church and the church of england cant decide amongst themselves

in the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who calls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his actions should be considered a christian

maybe some of those christians are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends  but surely if the bible can be so readily used to support unchristian acts it cant be much of a moral code

if the bible is the word of god why couldnt he have made it less easy to misinterpret

and how do you know that your beliefs arent a perversion of what your god intended

if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your sayso

sorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered others because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him a christian

obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned

but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsense

that does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones

nobody has ever proved that unicorns dont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are myths

it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default

of course weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still

well if atheisms so great why are there so many theists

unfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudosciences

many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods

certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand

of course theres more to religion than that

in the industrialized world we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations

religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves other purposes as well

but so many cultures have developed religions

surely that must say something

not really

most religions are only superficially similar for example its worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense

of course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so its rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another

what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god exists

for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one who does not

besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it

also it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders

a famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight

many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise

so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing

not entirely

it certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far

the theory of memetics talks of memes  sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds by analogy with genes

some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others

some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressure to keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken

some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes

of course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme

religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it

even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages

what are the fundamental messages of atheism

there are many important ideas atheists promote

the following are just a few of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions

there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules

be especially sceptical of positive claims

if you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to find it

search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable

make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have

its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself

just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good

if you must assume something assume something its easy to test

dont believe things just because you want them to be true

and finally and most importantly all beliefs should be open to question

how many contridictions do you want to see

good question

if i claim something is a general trend then to disprove this i guess youd have to show that it was not a general trend

no if youre going to claim something then it is up to you to prove it

think cold fusion

well ive provided examples to show that the trend was general and you or others have provided some counterexamples mostly ones surrounding mating practices etc

i dont think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality

and again the mating practices need to be reexamined try to find immoral nonmatingrelated activities

so youre excluding matingrelatedactivities from your natural morality

no but mating practices are a special case

ill have to think about it some more

yes i think that the natural system can be objectively deduced with the goal of species propogation in mind

but i am not equating the two as you so think

that is an objective system isnt necessarily the natural one

are you or are you not the man who wrote a natural moral system is the objective moral system that most animals  follow

indeed

but while the natural system is objective all objective systems are not the natural one

so the terms can not be equated

the natural system is a subset of the objective ones

now since homosexuality has been observed in most animals including birds and dolphins are you going to claim that most animals have the capacity of being immoral

i dont claim that homosexuality is immoral

it isnt harmful although it isnt helpful either to the mating process

and when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom dont you mean bisexuality

because we cant determine to what end we should be moral

are you claiming to be a group

we usually implies more than one entity

this is standard jargon

read any textbook

the we forms are used throughout

well im saying that these goals are not inherent

that is why they must be postulates because there is not really a way to determine them otherwise although it could be argued that they arise from the natural goalbut they are somewhat removed

postulate to assume posit

thats right

the goals themselves arent inherent

i can create a theory with a postulate that the sun revolves around the earth that the moon is actually made of green cheese and the stars are the portions of angels that intrudes into threedimensional reality

you could but such would contradict observations

i can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that given the length of one side of a triangle the length of a second side of the triangle and the degree of angle connecting them i can determine the length of the third side

but a postulate is something that is generally or always found to be true

i dont think your postulate would be valid

guess which one people are going to be more receptive to

in order to assume something about your system you have to be able to show that your postulates work

yes and i think the goals of survival and happiness do work

you think they dont

or are they not good goals

keith

kcochrannyxcsduedu keith justified and ancient cochran writes schneider natural morality may specifically be thought of as a code of ethics that a certain species has developed in order to survive

wait

are we talking about ethics or morals here

 is the distinction important

yes

we see this countless times in the animal kingdom and such a natural system is the basis for our own system as well

huh

 well our moral system seems to mimic the natural one in a number of ways

please describe these number of ways in detail

then explain the any contradictions that may arise

in order for humans to thrive we seem to need to live in groups heres your problem

we seem to need

whats wrong with the highlighted word

 i dont know

what is wrong

is it possible for humans to survive for a long time in the wild

yes its possible but it is difficult

humans are a social animal and that is a cause of our success

define difficult

and in order for a group to function effectively it needs some sort of ethical code

this statement is not correct

 isnt it

why dont you think so

explain the laws in america stating that you have to drive on the right hand side of the road

and by pointing out that a species conduct serves to propogate itself i am not trying to give you your tautology but i am trying to show that such are examples of moral systems with a goal

propogation of the species is a goal of a natural system of morality

so anybody who lives in a monagamous relationship is not moral

after all in order to ensure propogation of the species every man should impregnate as many women as possible

 no

as noted earlier lack of mating such as abstinence or homosexuality isnt really destructive to the system

it is a worst neutral

so if every member of the species was homosexual this wouldnt be destructive to the survival of the species

for that matter in herds of horses only the dominate stallion mates

when he diesis killedwhatever the new dominate stallion is the only one who mates

these seems to be a case of your natural system of morality trying to shoot itself in the figurative foot

 again the mating practices are something to be reexamined

the whole theory needs to be reexamined  kcochrannyxcsduedu  b c d e f g k m r s t  tsakc my thoughts my posts my ideas my responsibility my beer my pizza

 liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes   i dont expect the lion to know or not know anything of the kind

 in fact i dont have any evidence that lions ever consider such  issues

 and that of course is why i dont think you can assign moral  significance to the instinctive behaviour of lions

  what ive been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior

 that is it doesnt take much work to be moral but it certainly does to  be immoral in some cases

thats the craziest thing i ever heard

are you serious

it doesnt take much work to be moral

 also ive said that morality is a remnant of evolution

really

and thats why people discuss morality on a daily basis

because its a kind of evolutionary hangover like your little toe

 our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in the animal  kingdom

this must be some novel use of the phrase based on with which i am not sufficiently familiar

what do you mean by based on and what is the significance of it for your argument

  so you are basically saying that you think a moral is an undefinable  term and that moral systems dont exist

if we cant agree on a  definition of these terms then how can we hope to discuss them

   no its perfectly clear that i am saying that i know what a moral  is in my system but that i cant speak for other people

  but this doesnt get us anywhere

your particular beliefs are irrelevant  unless you can share them or discuss them well we can

what would you like to know about my particular moral beliefs

if you raise a topic ive never considered ill be quite happy to invent a moral belief out of thin air

jon

 there has been some discussion on the pros and cons about sex outside of  marriage

   where is the evidence for my opinions

at the moment there are just  generalities i can cite

for example i read that in the th century  the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from  depression has been steadily climbing in western societies probably  what i was reading referred particularly to the usa

similarly one  can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage  in this century in western societies  particularly with the sexual  revolution of the s but even before that i think otherwise the  sexual revolution of the s would not have been possible  particularly with the gradual weakening of christianity and consequently  christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage

i propose  that these two trends  greater level of general depression in society  and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity  are  linked with the latter being a prime cause of the former

i cannot  provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis  seems very reasonable to me and i request that people ponder upon it

  fred rice  a muslim giving his point of view

 dariceyoyoccmonasheduau i think this is a big leap sexdepression

one example is myself where no sexdepression  but seriously  promiscuity is on a decline depression is not and  it might be more reasonable to say depressionpromiscuity

i think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems relationships family job friends and promiscuity is used as an escape

since i see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond i dont see a problem with sex before not outside of marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as what is expected from a married couple

of course this is just my opinion

brian 

what if i act morally for no particular reason

then am i moral

what if morality is instinctive as in most animals

saying that morality is instinctive in animals is an attempt to assume your conclusion

which conclusion

you conclusion  correct me if i err  that the behaviour which is instinctive in animals is a natural moral system

see we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here

earlier you said that it must be a conscious act

by your definition no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality

you are trying to apply human terms to nonhumans

i think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative this does not prevent his behavior from being moral

you dont think that morality is a behavior pattern

what is human morality

a moral action is one that is consistent with a given pattern

that is we enforce a certain behavior as moral

you keep getting this backwards

you are trying to show that the behaviour pattern is a morality

whether morality is a behavior pattern is irrelevant since there can be behavior pattern for example the motions of the planets that most all

people would not call a morality

i try to show it but by your definition it cant be shown

and morality can be thought of a large class of princples

it could be defined in terms of many thingsthe laws of physics if you wish

however it seems silly to talk of a moral planet because it obeys the laws of phyics

it is less silly to talk about animals as they have at least some free will

as for rape surely there the burden of guilt is solely on the rapist

unless you force someone to live with the rapist against his will in which case part of the responsibility is yours

im sorry but i cant accept that

unless the rapist was hypnotized or something i view him as solely responsible for his actions

not necessarily especially if the rapist is known as such

for instance if you intentionally stick your finger into a loaded mousetrap and get snapped whose fault is it

in article phkfinnpdsidsinccom perrydsinccom jim perry writes rushdie is however as i understand a muslim

the fact that hes a british citizen does not preclude his being muslim

 rushdie was an atheist to use local terminology not to put words in his mouth at the time of writing tsv and at the time of the fatwa in february 

 well if he was born muslim i am fairly certain he was then he is muslim until he explicitly renounces islam

so far as i know he has never explicitly renounced islam though he may have been in extreme doubt about the existence of god

being muslim is a legal as well as intellectual issue according to islam

to put it as simply as possible i am not a muslim

i do not accept the charge of apostacy because i have never in my adult life affirmed any belief and what one has not affirmed one can not be said to have apostasized from

the islam i know states clearly that there can be no coercion in matters of religion

the many muslims i respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their faith purely by virtue of birth and that a person who freely chose not to be a muslim could therefore be put to death

salman rushdie in good faith  god satan paradise and hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth year when i quite abruptly lost my faith

and afterwards to prove my newfound atheism i bought myself a rather tasteless ham sandwich and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of the swine

no thunderbolt arrived to strike me down

 from that day to this i have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person

salman rushdie in god we trust  i think the rushdie affair has discredited islam more in my eyes than khomeini  i know there are fanatics and fringe elements in all religions but even apparently moderate muslims have participated or refused to distance themselves from the witchhunt against rushdie

 yes i think this is true but there khomeneis motivations are quite irrelevant to the issue

the fact of the matter is that rushdie made false statements fiction i know but where is the line between fact and fiction

about the life of mohammad

only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the nature of the novel could think such a thing

ill accept it reluctantly from mobs in pakistan but not from you

what is presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the actual mohammad

whats worse the novel doesnt present the mahoundmohammed character in any worse light than secular histories of islam in particular there is no lewd misrepresentation of his life or that of his wives

that is why few people rush to his defense  hes considered an absolute fool for his writings in the satanic verses

dont hold back hes considered an apostate and a blasphemer

however its not for his writing in the satanic verses but for what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is contained in that book

i have yet to find one single muslim who has convinced me that they have read the book

some have initially claimed to have done so but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial newsweek story might impart and all have made factual misstatements about events in the book

if you wish to understand the reasons behind this as well has the origin of the concept of the satanic verses  see the penguin paperback by rafiq zakariyah called mohammad and the quran

ill keep an eye out for it

i have a counterproposal i suggest that you see the viking hardcover by salman rushdie called the satanic verses

perhaps then youll understand

in article pwwspacatriceedu pwwspacsunriceedu peter walker writes in article qiefkthorusapmchpsnide frankdsuucp frank odwyer wrote  objective morality is morality built from objective values

 but where do those objective values come from

how can we measure them

what mediated thair interaction with the real world a moralon

or a scalar valuino field

science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round as you would wish it

if there is no such thing as objective value then science can not objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head

simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said to be more useful than a set of tarot cards

you like those conclusions

i dont

and how do we know they exist in the first place

one assumes objective reality one doesnt know it

 frank odwyer im not hatching that odwyersseie from hens by evelyn conlon how do we measure truth beauty goodness love friendship trust honesty etc

if things have no basis in objective fact then arent we limited in what we know to be true

cant we say that we can examples or instances of reason but cannot measure reason or is that semantics

frankdsuucp frank odwyer writes  plus questions for you why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism

 to the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to control events

 i think you lose the right to talk about the truth once you say values are relative

accuracy is a value judgement too

it so happens i agree with the substance of what you say below but its clear to me that at least some values are objective

truth is better than falsehood peace is better than war education is better than ignorance

we know these things if we know anything

while ill agree that these are generally held to be good things i question whether they come very close to being objective values

especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable

i doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally good or bad

and when i referred to the truth i was using the term hypothetically realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing

assuming for the moment that morals are relative then two relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that produces the desired results

 no they cannot because they acknowledge up front that the desired results do not exist

that after all is the meaning of compromise

 plus some problems if the relativists have no values in common compromise is impossible  what happens then

who if anyone is right

what happens if one relativist has a value never compromise

a value plant bombs in crowded shopping areas

after all if morals are relative these values cannot meaningfully be said to be incorrect

true enough

but they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals

one thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of personal accountability  the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some higher authority aka absolute moral truth

assuming that there is an absolute morality two disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right there is no room for compromise

once you beleive in absolute morals you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees with you is amoral

 untrue

one can accept that one does not know the whole truth

part of the objective truth about morality may well be that flexibility is better than rigidity compromise is better than believing you have a lock on morals etc

in the same way i can believe in an objective reality without claiming to know the mechanism for quantum collapse or who shot jfk

an objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth

interesting notion

 certainly one can have as ones morals a belief that compromise is good

but to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully

i suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise

how do you compromise on compromising

given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention id say that compromise seems to be better

 and i would agree

but its bloody to pointless to speak of it if its merely a matter of taste

is your liking for peace any better founded than someone elses liking for icecream

im looking for a way to say yes to that question and relativism isnt it

almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another be it morals or consequences people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief

in justifying a commitement to peace i might argue that it lets people live long  healthy and peaceful lives

while that much may well be true it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war  killing off the most agressive member of society trimming down the population stimulating production

the equation is always more complex than presented

to characterize relative morals as merely following ones own conscience  desires is to unduly simplify it

from dfullerportalhqvideocartcom dave fuller subject re death penalty was re political atheists

organization videocart inc xnewsreader tin 

pl lines    the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime but the legal   shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court   battles etc

have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what   it should be

hence the question is do we instate the death penalty as   it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of   it entirely

i doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a deterrent to crime

if so why doesnt every crime carry a death penalty 

that would be effictive wouldnt it 

the death penalty is a punishment much like a  fine for speeding is a punishment

anyway somebody with murder on the mind doesnt much care about the consequences

i think another problem is that people dont think they will get caught

if i wanted to kill another person i wouldnt care what the penalty was if i didnt think i would get caught

if it was to be strictly a deterrent it should have been more along the lines of torture

dave fuller dfullerportalhqvideocartcom

 sorry it is generally accepted that the rise of the inquisition is the reason why torture was introduced outside the romanic countries at the end of the middle ages

in other words the holy mother church which is lead infallibly by the holy ghost has spread it

 the roman catholic church claims to be lead by the infallable pope

thats why she the rc church has done so many wicked things to xtians and nonbelievers alike

  the rationale that the pope speaking ex cathedra is infallible is based on the claim above

the dogma about the pope is of jesuitic origin and has not been been accepted before the mid of the last century

 benedikt youre right

pl lines  cwainwright eczcawmipsnottacuk wrote  i   jim     i always thought that homophobe was only a word used at act up   rallies i didnt beleive real people used it

lets see if we agree   on the terms definition

a homophobe is one who actively and   militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent   homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation

  since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a   homophobe your implication is clear it must necessarily follow that   all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least

    crap crap crap crap crap

a definition of any type of phobe comes from  phobia  an irrational fear of

hence a homophobe not only in act up meetings  the word is apparently in general use now

or perhaps it isnt in the bible

 wouldst thou prefer if i were to communicate with thou in bilespeak

  does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider

does an  agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space

do you  understand english

  obviously someone who has phobia will react to it

they will do their best  to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or  run away

or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes

people  who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or  cause them or themselves violence

 isnt that what i said  what are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful

     it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function   other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs   when the members of one generation pass along their traits to   subsequent generations

homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend

if i   take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to   intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our   species at least is going nowhere

    so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children

 hmmno wonder the world is overpopulated

obviously you keep to the  monty python song every sperm is sacred

and if as you say it has  a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own  arguement natural

consider the context im talking about an evolutionary function

one of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate those who dont have no purpose in that context

   another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to   survive the participation of both parents is necessary  a family must   exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they cannot constitute a   family

since the majority of humankind is part of a family   homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you   will

    well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have  vanished years ago due to nonprocreation

also the parent from single  parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must  by your arguement die

by your argument homosexuality is genetically determined

as to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context means

i am talking about evolution the preservation of the species the fundamental premise of the whole process

   but it gets worse

since the overwhelming majority of people actually   prefer a heterosexual relationship homosexuality is a social   abberation as well

the homosexual eschews the biological imperative   to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in   the most fundamental social element the family

but wait theres   more

    read the above

i expect you to have at least ten children by now with  the family growing

these days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly  without it there would be noone but more to do with pleasure

in prepill  and precondom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children

 these days is just aint true

people can decide whether or not to have  children and when

soon they will be able to choose its sex c but thats  another arguement so its more of a lifestyle decision

again by  your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must  be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children

both are  as unnatural as each other

yet another nonsequitur

sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental

that homosexuals dont procreate means that sex is only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose

   since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some   policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that   their sexuality is a preference a lifestyle an orientation a   choice that should be protected by law

now if homosexuality is a mere   choice and if it is both contrary to nature and antisocial then it   is a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they   became prominent

    people are people are people

who are you to tell anyone else how to live  their life

are you godtm

if so fancy a date

heres pretty obvious dodge do you really think youve said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement

i am not telling anyone anything i am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality providing its a merely an alternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand

i realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing a value and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if you are to be consistent you have no case in this regard

   to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to   ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of   the homosexual lifestyle

but since the charge is only intended to   intimidate its really just demogoguery and not to be taken   seriously

fact is jim there are far more persuasive arguments for   suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this a start

    again crap

all your arguments are based on outdated ideals

likewise the  bible

would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by  a bastard to eternal damnation

or someone who crushes his penis either  accidently or not

both are in deuteronomy

im sure your comment pertains to something but youve disguised it so well i cant see what

where did i mention ideals outdated or otherwise

your arguments are very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute

   as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in   scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from   teaching by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and   biological

since any adult is a role model for a child it is   incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from   those who would do the child harm

in this case harm means primarily   social though that could be extended easily enough

      you show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as  normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you

one mans meat  is another mans poison

 what has this got to do with anything

would you pick a single point that you find offensive and explain your objections i would really like to believe that you can discuss this issue intelligibly

ah yes i keep forgetting governments are superior entities to religious organizations

forgive me  the gun is the higher law

this is degenerating to zumder logic

of course governments are superior entities they are elected by the people whereas religious leaders certainly are not

perhaps not in christianity but in islam the choice of religious leaders is to be made by the people

so much for your superiority argument

 those who the people trust to make the law obviously represents the higher law

that is democracy

democracy is a basic element of islam

learn that one

ever notice that the socalled fundamentalists in algeria who are being repressed by the secular government won in free and democratic elections

gregg

i assume that you say here a religious law is for the followers of the religion

that begs the question why the religion has the right to define who is a follower even when the offenders disagree

no i say religious law applies to those who are categorized as belonging to the religion when event being judged applies

this prevents situations in which someone is a member of a religion who when charged claims that heshe was not a member of the religion so they are free to go on as if nothing had happened

  there are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of  both atheists and theists

 perhaps since im a bit weak on  history somone here would like to give a list of wars causedled by  theists



this thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint according to some utilitarian principle ie

atheismreligion is wrong because it causes death

the underlying moral is that death is wrong

this is a rather arbitrary measure of validity

benedikt

why do babies get diseases etc

what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve

without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism heres the main problem

the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does not support it but indicates something far different

the earth by latest estimates is about 

billion years old and has had life for about 

billion of those years

humans have only been around for at most about  years

but the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving and in fact diseaseridden long before there were people

yes there are fossils that show signs of disease mostly bone disorders of course but there are some

heck not just fossil evidence but what weve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long long time

if human sin was what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before humans

 god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw

and without getting sidetracked into the theological ramifications of the original sin the main effect of the socalled original sin for this discussion was to remove humanity from gods protection since by their choice ae cut themselves off from intimate fellowship with god

in addition their sin caused them to come under the dominion of satan who then assumed dominion over the earth deletions since humanity was no longer under gods protection but under satans dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterialviral and genetic

although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this

uh

i know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this

there is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off in perfect condition

it seems to adapt to its envionment in a collective sense

im really curious as to what you mean by the degeneration of the genetic code

human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our wellbeing and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease

it is a bad combination

umm

nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria and they to us

only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size but the ranks keep changing

for example bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease im sure youll agree

but it still pops up from time to time even today and doesnt do as much damage

part of that is because of better sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past

this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago and because the really nasty variants overgrazed forgive the poor terminology im an engineer not a doctor

  and died off for lack of nearby hosts

i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne is only a few hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer

it seems to be getting less nasty wage  hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseasesdisorders

now wait a minute

i have a question

humans were created perfect right

and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease

it seems unlikely that satan whos making the diseases would also gift humans with the means to fight them off

simpler to make the diseases less lethal if he wants survivors

as far as i can see our immune systems imperfect though they may presently

be must have been built into us by god

i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not at the time of design necessary

that is god made our immune systems ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases

this may be more of a mysticalsupernatural explanation than you are prepared to accept but god is not responsible for disease

even if satan had nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since humanity forsook gods protection

heres another puzzle

what exactly do you mean by perfect in the phrase created perfect and without flaw

to my mind a perfect system would be incapable of degrading over time

a perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not a perfect system

at least imho

or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmers glue

that is the original genetic instructions were perfect but were written in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart

if so why could god not have used better materials

was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself of did it just choose not to

deletions in summary newborns are innocent but god does not cause their suffering

my main point as i said was that there really isnt any evidence for the explanation you give

at least that im aware of

but i couldnt help making a few nitpicks here and there

im not sure about this but i think the charge of shatim also  applies to rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella  of the fasad ruling

  please define the words shatim and fasad before you use them again

 my apologies

shatim i believe refers to slandering or spreading slander and lies about the prophetsas  any of the prophets

basically any prophet ive ever dealt with has either been busy hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in florida

then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it

its a kind of willful caulmny and cursing thats indicated by the word

this is the best explanation i can come up with off the top of my head  ill try and look up a more technical definition when i have the time

never mind that but let me tell you about this chevelle i bought from this dude you guessed it a prophet named mohammed

ive got the car for like two days when the tranny kicks then manny my mechanic tells me it was loaded with sawdust

take a guess whether mohammed was anywhere to be found

i dont think so

 fasad is a little more difficult to describe

again this is not a technical definition  ill try and get that later

literally oh mohammed

the word fasad means mischief

but its a mischief on the order of magnitude indicated by the word corruption

its when someone who is doing something wrong to begin with seeks to escalate the hurt yeah you mohammed

disorder concern harm etc

the mischief initially caused by their actions

the wrong is specifically related to attacks against god and his messenger and mischief corruption disorder etc

you slimy mass of pond scum

resulting from that

the attack need not be a physical attack and there are different levels of penalty proscribed depending on the extent of the mischief and whether the person or persons sought to make hay of the situation

the severest punishment is death

 therefore that girl is a car

unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous

rewriting more carefully we have at least two possibilities

the first things called mercedes are cars that girl is called mercedes therefore that girl is a car that is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction

it is not sound because the first statement is false

similarly i would hold that jims example is valid but not sound

another possible interpretation of what you wrote is there exists at least one car called mercedes that girl is called mercedes therefore that girl is a car  which isnt valid

 hi   i have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with  a theist acquaintance

he stated that thousands of bibles were discovered  at a certain point in time which were syllableperfect

this therefore  meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted  by my acquaintace was approximately  years after the death of jesus

hi adda most bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time  the time when the author wrote it

unfortunately like all works from this time period and earlier all that exists today are copies

  cutting all of the crap out of the way ie god wrote it could anyone answer  the following   

how old is the oldest surviving copy of the new testament

there are parts of books scraps really that date from around the mid second century ad 

there are some complete books letters etc

from the middle third century

the first complete collection of the new testament dates from the early th century ad 

throughout this period are writings of various early church fathersleaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings

 

is there any truth in my acquaintances statements

if you mean that someone discovered thousands of bibles which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the st centuryno

if you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts within the dates given above but not letter perfect and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs now lost probably were written starting sometime shortly after ad  then yes

 

from whowhere did the bible originate

from the original authors

we call them matthew mark luke john peter paul james and one other not identified

pl lines  acoopermacccmacalstredu wrote  i wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of  the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group  of the population

ive been thinking about this every now and then since i cut my ties with christianity

it is surprising to note that a large majority of people at least in finland seem to be apatheists  even though   of the population are members of the lutheran church of finland religious people are actually a minority

could it be possible that many people believe in god just in case

it seems people do not want to seek the truth they fall prey to pascals wager or other poor arguments

a small minority of those who do believe reads the bible regularly

the majority doesnt care  it believes but doesnt know what or how

people dont usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle they only want to keep the virtual gate open

a christian would say that they are not born in the spirit but this does not disturb them

religion is not something to think about

im afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream

religions have a strong appeal to people nevertheless  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to

coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop too many people take the poison with a smile

or just pretend to swallow and unconsciously hope god wouldnt notice    also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a  higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking

the  typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the  same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the  other qualitatively

but then again a measuring stick must be drawn  somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core  than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it  expresses its own selfishness

if logic and reason are valued then i would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition

theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in  ive yet to see good reasons to believe in gods or to take a leap of faith at all

a revelation would do

however why do we value logic and reasoning

i grant that he did not explicity make this accusation but  he came pretty damn close

he is certainly accusing the guy of  sympathizing with those who would like to exterminate the jews and  thats good enough for me

the poster casually trashed two thousand years of jewish history and ken replied that there had previously been people like him in germany

thats right

there have been

there have also been people who were formally nazis

but the nazi party would have gone nowhere without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the street who behaved as though casual antisemitism was perfectly acceptable

now what exactly dont you understand about what i wrote and why dont you see what it has to do with the matter at hand

jon

 this is the reason i like the controversy of postmodernism the issues of polarities  evil and good  are just artificial constructs and they fall apart during a closer inspection

 the more i look into the notion of a constant struggle between the evil and good forces the more it sounds like a metaphor that people just assume without closer inspection

 more info please

im not well exposed to these ideas

now can we please use recscouting for the purpose for which it was established

clearly we netnews voters decided that we did not want to provide a scouting newsgroup to give fringe groups a forum for their antisocietal political views

ok this is the only thing i will comment on from stan at this time part of this forum we call recscouting is for policy discussions and related topics

this is a policy discussion and involves related topics

this is not a fringe group discussion

obviously it engenders strong feelings from all sides of the issues at hand

wether a particular view is antisocietal or not is your opinion and yours alone dont try to make it seem otherwise

if you do not wish to engage in this discussion use a kill file

if you wish to continue in this discussion please do so knowing full well the implications that apply

i know for myself that i plan on continuing with the discussion when i have the wish to have input

i for one am tired of people trying to say that this is not a matter significant for this group

it is and quite so

especially for those of us who feel the impact more closely

 hello

i just started reading this group today and i think i am going  to be a large participant in its daily postings

i liked the section of  the faq about constructing logical arguments  well done

i am an atheist  but i do not try to turn other people into atheists

i only try to figure  why people believe the way they do  i dont much care if they have a  different view than i do

when it comes down to it 





i could be wrong

 i am willing to admit the possibility  something religious followers  dont seem to have the capability to do

welcome aboard

  i notice alot of posts from bobby

why does anybody ever respond to  his posts 

he always falls back on the same argument i think you just answered your own question there   if the religion is followed it will cause no bad   he is right

just because an event was explained by a human to have been  done in the name of religion does not mean that it actually followed  the religion

he will always point to the ideal and say that it wasnt  followed so it cant be the reason for the event

there really is no way  to argue with him so why bother

sure you may get upset because his  answer is blind and not supported factually  but he will win every time  with his little argument

i dont think there will be any postings from  me in direct response to one of his

most responses were against his postings that spouted the fact that all atheists are foolsevil for not seeing how peachy islam is

i would leave the procon arguments of islam to fred rice who is more level headed and seems to know more on the subject anyway

  happy to be aboard

this should not turn  into a debate on antisemitism but you should also point out that luthers  antisemitism was based on religious grounds while hitlers was on racial  grounds and wagnmers on aesthetic grounds

gillow who had secretly studied the innermost workings of the vatican since returning from vietnam in a wheel chair first approached the scientific community with his theory in the late s the whole hat thing that was just a cover up

the vatican didnt want the catholic communitytm to realize their leader was hefting nearly  kilograms of extraneous bone tissue on the top of his skull notes gillow in his report

there are whole laboratories in the vatican that experiment with tissue transplants and bone marrow experiments

what started as a genetic fluke in the mid s is now scientifically engineered and bred for

the whole bone transplant idea started in the mid sixties inspired by doctor timothy leary transplanting deer bone cells into small white rats

gillow is quick to point out the assassination attempt on pope john paul ii and the disappearance of dr leary from the public eye

asking about the unknown i guess you should have tried one of the socculture groups in the middle east or south asia area they are a little more open than the islam channel

i think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the world created itself or something like that so each particle is a god which created the other gods

date  apr   gmt from frank odwyer frankdsuucp  in article aprmonuccmonasheduau dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice writes  just borrowing your post mr rice  in ppsilinkcom robert knowles ppsilinkcom writes are you sure that democracy is the driving force behind the massacres in east timor

it is certainly odd that so many of the worlds massacres occur along religious lines independently of any claims to a democratic form of government

are ireland and northern ireland considered democracies

would you attribute their problems to democracy even though they are democracies

which motivates them more religion or democracy

 mr

rice was pointing out a fallacy in the assertion that islam is evil because some of those who claim to follow it are evil not asserting that democracy causes massacres as i read it

that is right he was

and i was pointing out that his use of indonesians killing the east timorese as a result of democracy was a bit weak because democracy is not much of a motivation for doing much of anything in indonesia from what i remember

east timor was a former portguese territory which was forcibly annexed by indonesia

last i heard over  indonesians have died trying to keep east timor a part of indonesia

being a former portuguese colony there is a strong catholic influence in east timor as i recall

so it seems a bit odd that yet again we have another war being fought between people who just happen to have different religions

purely coincidental i guess

but then the real motivation is to get the vote out and make democracy work in indonesia

i pointed out the secession movement in aceh which has also been brutally dealt with in the past by the indonesian government

the harshly with all secessionist movements

the evidence it appears to me that the indonesian government has dealt very harshly with all secession movements

i know that the head of the indonesian armed forces for a very long time was benny murdani  a christian

indonesia has been heavy handed in east timor for a long time  even when murdani was head of the armed forces

the people who make up the indonesian government are in general motivated by national interests not religious ones

  clearly better than the alternative but as an american what strikes  me as strange about this story is that it should have even been  considered an issue

jim there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing

an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature  exclusively

there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything

there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc

 everything is random nothing is determnined

this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products

there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence its just a happy accident

for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value

the products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment from teaching training observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside

these mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more content is of no consequence

the human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill

how then can an atheist judge value

what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god

on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned

it seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose

what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values

since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value

the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that heshe just doesnt like it  thats it

any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense

that you dont like what god told people to do says nothing about god or gods commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction

that your objections seem well founded is due to the way youve been conditioned there is no truth content

the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality

i didnt make these rules its inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent you have to accept the nonsignificance of any human thought even your own

all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc

and cannot participate

your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever

bill

when they are victimized they are muslims

when they victimize others they are not true muslims tm or no muslims at all

 quite annoying

 i dont understand the point of this petty sarcasm

it is a basic principle of islam that if one is born muslim or one says i testify that there is no god but god and mohammad is a prophet of god that so long as one does not explicitly reject islam by word then one must be considered muslim by all muslims

so the phenomenon youre attempting to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic islamic principles

if you want to attack islam you could do better than than to argue against something that islam explicitly contradicts

 it was no criticism of islam for a change it was a criticism of the arguments used

namely whenever people you identify as muslims are the victims of the attacks of others they are used an argument for the bad situation of muslims

but whenever deeds by muslim that victimize others are named they do not count as an argument because what these people did was not done as a true muslims

no mention is made how muslims are the cause of a bad situation of another party

double standards

benedikt

explain to me how instinctive acts can be moral acts and i am happy to listen

for example if it were instinctive not to murder then not murdering would have no moral significance since there would be nothing voluntary about it

see there you go again saying that a moral act is only significant if it is voluntary

why do you think this

and anyway humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts

so only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other beings mimics theirs

you are starting to get the point

mimicry is not necessarily the same as the action being imitated

a parrot saying pretty polly isnt necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly

you are attaching too many things to the term moral i think

lets try this is it good that animals of the same species dont kill each other

or do you think this is right

or do you think that animals are machines and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong

animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but they dont

they do

i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this but you seem to have a very short memory

those werent arbitrary killings

they were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot

are you trying to say that this isnt an act of morality because most animals arent intelligent enough to think like we do

im saying  there must be the possibility that the organism  its not  just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives

its right there in the posting you are replying to

yes it was but i still dont understand your distinctions

what do you mean by consider

can a small child be moral

how about a gorilla

a dolphin

a platypus

where is the line drawn

does the being need to be self aware

what do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of the same species from arbitrarily killing each other

dont you find the fact that they dont at all significant

keith

 if some society came up with a good reason for why rape and murder are ok i  would be consistent with my position and hold that it was still wrong

my  basis of morality is not on societal norms or on current legalities

my  basis is surprise surprise on both the bible and on inherent moral  abhorrences ah

but what exactly is inherently abhorrent and why is it so

what youre saying is in effect i think some things are repulsive and i know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me so they should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever period

which in and of itself is nice enough to some extent i agree with you

but i do not agree that things are inherently or absolutely immoral they are labeled immoral each for its own good reason and if the reason can even theoretically change then so can the label

  yes thats vague and the only way i know off the top of my head to  defend it is to say that all humans are similarly made

yes that falls  into the trap of creation no it doesnt

humans are to some extent similar because we all belong to the same species that that species has evolved is another story altogether

to a certain extent evolution can even lend credence to moral absolutism of a flavour

  my arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust goodness  love respect courage and honesty in any society rather than deceipt  hatred disrespect cowardness and dishonesty

youre saying morality is whatll keep society alive and kicking

it is i think up to a point but societies are not all alike and neither are their moralities

 no i havent been everywhere and  seen everyone but according to my thesis i dont have to since i hold that  we were all created similarly

similar  identical

 if that makes an unfalsifiable thesis just say  so and ill both work out what i can and punt to fellow theists

no its falsifiable through finding someoe who was created different whatever that might be in the real world

 for the motto to be legitimate it would have to read  in god gods or godlessness we trust  would you approve of such a motto

no

not unless the only way to get rid of the current one was to change it to such as that

in article aprmonuccmonasheduau dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice writes  deletion of course people say what they think to be the religion and that this is not exactly the same coming from different people within the religion

there is nothing with there existing different perspectives within the religion  perhaps one can say that they tend to converge on the truth

 my point is that they are doing a lot of harm on the way in the meantime

 and that they converge is counterfactual religions appear to split and diverge

even when there might be a true religion at the core the layers above determine what happens in practise and they are quite inhumane usually

  what you post then is supposed to be an answer but i dont see what is has got to do with what i say

 i will repeat it

religions as are harm people

and religions dont converge they split

giving more to disagree upon

and there is a lot of disagreement to whom one should be tolerant or if one should be tolerant at all

ideologies also split giving more to disagree upon and may also lead to intolerance

so do you also oppose all ideologies

i dont think your argument is an argument against religion at all but just points out the weaknesses of human nature

big deletion  do women have souls in islam

 people have said here that some muslims say that women do not have souls

i must admit i have never heard of such a view being held by muslims of any era

i have heard of some christians of some eras holding this viewpoint but not muslims

are you sure you might not be confusing christian history with islamic history

 yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the turkish caliphate

i would like a reference if you have got one for this is news to me

anyhow that women are the spiritual equals of men can be clearly shown from many verses of the quran

for example the quran says  for muslim men and women  for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in charity for men and women who fast and deny themselves for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in gods praise  for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward

 quran  abdullah yusuf alis translation  there are other quotes too but i think the above quote shows that men and women are spiritual equals and thus that women have souls just as men do very clearly

  no it does not

it implies that they have souls but it does not say they have souls

and it is not given that the quote above is given a high priority in all interpretations

one must approach the quran with intelligence

any thinking approach to the quran cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals

i think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls

does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven

or to have a great reward understood to be in the afterlife

i think the usual answer would be no  in which case the part saying for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have souls

if it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then i have no idea what a soul is

as for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations any thinking approach to the quran has to give all verses of the quran equal priority

that is because according to muslim belief the whole quran is the revelation of god  in fact denying the truth of any part of the quran is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in islam

quite similar to you other post even when the quran does not encourage slavery it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to slavery

it is a non sequitur

look any approach to the quran must be done with intelligence and thought

it is in this fashion that one can try to understand the qurans message

in a book of finite length it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings it can guide you

i think however that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they must have souls from the above verse

lets try to understand what the quran is trying to teach rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage

the misinterpretations of the quran based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited

lets try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try to twist islam for their own ends  something i do not deny  but provides no reflection on the true teachings of islam whatsoever

supersedes mantiscouk lines  archivename atheismlogic altatheismarchivename logic lastmodified  april  version 

constructing a logical argument although there is much argument on usenet the general quality of argument found is poor

this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate

logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference concise oed

logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid

of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument

note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable

the matter is very much open for debate

this document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job

propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument

a proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example it is raining or today is tuesday

propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false

note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning

the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it

so god exists and there exists a god both express the same proposition

an argument is to quote the monty python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition

an argument consists of three stages

first of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated

these are called the premises of the argument

they are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions

premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on

the phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises

if something doesnt seem obvious to you dont be afraid to question it

you can always say oh yes youre right it is obvious when youve heard the explanation

next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference

in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted

there are various forms of valid inference

the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference

inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore

finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument  the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference

conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on

the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference

for example every event has a cause premise the universe has a beginning premise all beginnings involve an event premise this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument

a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation

sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion

this is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing

recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions

many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument

some statements look like arguments but are not

for example if the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of god

this is not an argument it is a conditional statement

it does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion

it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but well come to those later

another example god created you therefore do your duty to god

the phrase do your duty to god is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false

therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument

finally causality is important

consider a statement of the form a because b

if were interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence the statement is an argument

if were trying to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explanation

for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start

this is an argument

my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine

this is an explanation

there are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive

a deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions  that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true

a deductive argument is either valid or invalid

a valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true

an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion

inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are

there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive

however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing

it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds

this is because of the slightly counterintuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully

obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions

however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions

for example all insects have wings premise woodlice are insects premise therefore woodlice have wings conclusion here the conclusion is not true because the arguments premises are false

if the arguments premises were true however the conclusion would be true

the argument is thus entirely valid

more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in all fish live in the sea premise dolphins are fish premise therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises

we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication

the symbol  denotes implication a is the premise b the conclusion

t and f represent true and false respectively

premise conclusion inference a b ab  f f t if the premises are false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false

t f f if the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid

t t t if the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true

a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true

a sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion

be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments

to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy

it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument

these pitfalls are known as fallacies

in everyday english the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs

this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing

so for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely

by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them

the following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive

argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion

it is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right

the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer

for example 

thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible

all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell

argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man

the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion

this is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it

for example atheism is an evil philosophy

it is practised by communists and murderers

sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer

this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witnesss testimony is false

to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list

the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponents particular circumstances

for example it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food

how can you argue otherwise when youre quite happy to wear leather shoes

this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponents argument

this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion

for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing

youre white

this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that ones adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well

argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance

this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false

or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true

note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle

examples of course the bible is true

nobody can prove otherwise

of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist

nobody has shown any proof that they are real

note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty

also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur

for example a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth

the earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles

therefore no such flood occurred

in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred

we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however

argumentum ad misericordiam this is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading

the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted

for example i did not murder my mother and father with an axe

please dont find me guilty im suffering enough through being an orphan

argumentum ad populum this is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people

to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people

this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language

for example pornography must be banned

it is violence against women

the bible must be true

millions of people know that it is

are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools

argumentum ad numeram this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum

it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct

argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion

for example isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god

this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject

for example we can distinguish quite clearly between stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed

searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is wellqualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence

the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable

it is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific

for example christians generally dislike atheists

you are a christian so you must dislike atheists

this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules

converse accident  hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident

it occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases

for example jim bakker was an insincere christian

therefore all christians are insincere

sweeping generalization  dicto simpliciter a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable

a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization

non causa pro causa  post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known as false cause fallacies

the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause

for example i took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared

so god cured me of the headache

the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event

for example the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism

therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons

cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc

it asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the causes of the events

petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached

circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach

often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument

for example homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office

hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job

therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail

therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office

note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion

an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the british secret services official ban on homosexual employees

another example is the classic we know that god exists because the bible tells us so

and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of god

complex question  fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of presupposition

one example is the classic loaded question have you stopped beating your wife

the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked

this trick is often used by lawyers in crossexamination when they ask questions like where did you hide the money you stole

similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue

or does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization

ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion

for example a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of christianity are undoubtably true

if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true

sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light

equivocation equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument

for example what could be more affordable than free software

but to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable

amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing

accent accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning

in this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized

for example consider we should not speak ill of our friends and we should not speak ill of our friends fallacies of composition one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole

for example the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very lightweight

the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items

for example a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus

therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses

fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition

like its opposite it exists in two varieties

the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts

for example you are studying at a rich college

therefore you must be rich

the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item

for example ants can destroy a tree

therefore this ant can destroy a tree

the slippery slope argument this argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events

there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event

for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and well have a nation full of drugaddicts on welfare

therefore we cannot legalize marijuana

a is based on b fallacies  is a type of fallacies these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar

examples isnt history based upon faith

if so then isnt the bible also a form of history

islam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so isnt islam a form of christianity

cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so arent dogs a form of cat

affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b b is true therefore a is true

to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier

denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false

again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy

note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter has the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false where a does not in fact imply b at all

here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce anything about b

converting a conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then a argumentum ad antiquitam this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because thats the way its always been

argumentum ad novitam this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else

argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right

argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier

this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam

argumentum ad nauseam this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard

an argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something

bifurcation also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist

plurium interrogationum  many questions this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question

non sequitur a nonsequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it

red herring this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyones attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion

reification  hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing

shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition

shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made

the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise

straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone elses position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished

it is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made

the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over

the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other

this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anticryptography legislation i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it

such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported martin luther king

are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for black liberation

how dare you

tu quoque this is the famous you too fallacy

it occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it

for instance youre just being randomly abusive

so

youve been abusive too

 liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes     the little things above were in reference to germany clearly

people  said that there were similar things in germany but no one could name any

 thats not true

i gave you two examples

one was the rather  pevasive antisemitism in german christianity well before hitler  arrived

the other was the system of social ranks that were used  in imperail germany and austria to distinguish jews from the rest  of the population

  these dont seem like little things to me

at least they are orders  worse than the motto

do you think that the motto is a little thing  that will lead to worse things

you dont think these are little things because with twentytwenty hindsight you know what they led to

jon

in article aprbmerhbnrca dgrahambmersbnrca douglas graham writes the poster casually trashed two thousand years of jewish history and ken replied that there had previously been people like him in germany

i think the problem here is that i pretty much ignored the part about the jews sightseeing for  years thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing palestinians

in retrospect i can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many

i originally saw it just as poetic license but its understandable that others might see it differently

i still think that ken came on a bit strong though

i also think that your advice to masud khan before you argue with someone like mr arromdee its a good idea to do a little homework or at least think

was unnecessary

thats right

there have been

there have also been people who were formally nazis

but the nazi party would have gone nowhere without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the street who behaved as though casual antisemitism was perfectly acceptable

 now what exactly dont you understand about what i wrote and why dont you see what it has to do with the matter at hand

throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual antisemitism

if i agreed with that then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant

but i think youre reading a lot into one flip sentence

while probably not true in this case too often the charge of antisemitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of israel

anyway id rather be somewhere else so im outta this thread

 i think the list of books suffers far too much from being christian based i agree that most of the traffic is of this nature although a few islamic references might be good but i still think an overview would be nice

one book i have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called mans religions by john b noss

it was a textbook in a class i had on comparative religion or some such thing

it has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading

it doesnt compare religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities

but nothing i have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or christian based

in fact christianity mercifully consumes only  or so of its nearly  pages

the book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began india east asia near east

there is nothing about new world religions from the aztecs mayas incas etc

just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays

and a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way

if you like the old stuff then a couple of books called the ancient near east by james b pritchard are pretty cool

 may i ask where is this collective bullcrap coming from

 



 

 by collective i was referring to the idea that god works with humanity on two levels individually and collectively

if mankind as a whole decides to undertake a certain action the majority of mankind well i guess hypothetical adam was the majority of mankind seeing how he was the only man at the time

then god will allow the consequences of that action to affect mankind as a whole

 in article cqavwgaustinibmcom karneraustinibmcom f karner writes    okay

so you want me to name names

there are obviously no official  records of these pseudomarriages because they are performed for  convenience

what happens typically is that the woman is willing to move  in with her lover without any scruples or legal contracts to speak of

 the man is merely utilizing a loophole by entering into a temporary  religious marriage contract in order to have sex

nobody complains  nobody cares nobody needs to know

   perhaps you should alert your imam

it could be that this practice is  far more widespread than you may think

or maybe it takes  muslim men  to witness the penetration to decide if the practice exists

      again you astound me with the level of ignorance you display muslims  are not allowed to enter temporary marriages got that

there is  no evidence for it it an outlawed practise so get your facts  straight buddy

give me references for it or just tell everyone you  were lying

it is not a widespread as you may think fantasise in  fact contrary to your fantasies it is not practised at all amongst  muslims

first of all im not your buddy

second read what i wrote

im not talking about what muslims are allowed to do merely what some practice

they consider themselves as muslim as you so dont retort with the old and tired they must not be true muslims bullshit

if i gave you the names what will you do with this information

is a fatwa going to be leashed out against the perpetrators

do you honestly think that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess

with the kind of extremism shown by your coreligionaries

fat chance

at any rate there can be no conclusive proof by the very nature of the act

perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in theory but hope that allah will forgive them in the end

i think its rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims in this regard

also kind of silly

in qvabjgjhorusapmchpsnide frankdsuucp frank odwyer writes  in article cqgmdlnewscsouiucedu cobbalexialisuiucedu mike cobb writes  am i making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals

where do they come from

the question came from the idea that i heard that morals come from whatever is societally mandated

its only one aspect of morality

societal morality is necessarily very crude and broadbrush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  and often its a little overenthusiastic about doing so

individual morality is a different thing it often includes societal mores or society is in trouble but is stronger

for example some people are vegetarian though eating meat may be perfectly legal

 merely a question for the basis of morality  moralethical behavior  societally acceptable behavior

 who is society  depends on the society

 doesnt help

is the point irrelevant

no

often the answer is we are

but if society is those who make the rules thats a different question

if society is who should make the rules thats yet another

i dont claim to have the answers either but i dont think we do it very well in ireland and i like some things about the us system at least in principle

 how do they define what is acceptable

 depends

on again this comes from a certain question see above

well ideally they dont but if they must they should do it by consensus imo

 how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position

 by adopting a default position that peoples moral decisions are none of societys business  so how can we put people in jail

how can we condemn other societies

because sometimes thats necessary

the hard trick is to recognise when it is and equally importantly when it isnt

 and only interfering when its truly necessary

 why would it be necessary

what right do we have to interfere

imo it isnt often that interference ie

jail and force of various kinds and degrees is both necessary and effective

where you derive the right to interfere is a difficult question  its a sort of liars paradox force is necessary for freedom

one possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldnt object if their own freedom is taken away  the paradox doesnt arise if we dont actively wish to take way anyones freedom

  the introduction of permissible interference causes the problem that it can be either too much or too little  but most people seem to agree that some level of interference is necessary

 they see the need for a justice system

how can we even define that term

only by consensus i guess

 thus you get a situation where the law often allows what honour forbids which ive come to believe is as it should be

 i admit i dont understand that statement

what i mean is that while thusandsuch may be legal thusandsuch may also be seen as immoral

the law lets you do it but you dont let yourself do it

eating meat for example

merely a question for the basis of morality  moralethical behavior  societally acceptable behavior

i disagree with these

what society thinks should be irrelevant

what the individual decides is all that is important

 who is society i think this is fairly obvious  how do they define what is acceptable

generally by what they feel is right which is the most idiotic policy i can think of

 how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position

i pondered it for all of ten seconds when i realised that since we dont have any reliable statistics for sexual promiscuity and since the whole issue of depression isnt at all well defined for earlier centuries you are probably talking crap

keith

in another part of this thread youve been telling us that the goal of a natural morality is what animals do to survive

thats right

humans have gone somewhat beyond this though

perhaps our goal is one of selfactualization

but suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some other species either terrestrial or alien

now you are letting an omniscient being give information to me

this was not part of the original premise

does that make it moral to do so

which type of morality are you talking about

in a natural sense it is not at all immoral to harm another species as long as it doesnt adversely affect your own i guess

keith

you might not like what bernard lewis writes about label him as a zionist or such to discredit him etc

you misrepresent me selim

the hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book orientalism by edward said

edward said by the way is a christian not a muslim

i think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in race and slavery in the middle east since he clearly distinguishes between slavery under islam and the practice of slavery in other countries like the us prior to the civil war

he also does not conceal that there are verses in the quran which promote the liberation of slaves

what he doesnt and i dont think nobody can deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be abolished in islamic countries

now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on muslims but the facts are out there

i also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewis being a zionist to what i wrote

regarding bernard lewis him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and halftruths about islam

read orientalism by edward said  see the evidence for yourself

in fact i may post some of it here if it isnt too long

they were encyclopaedic information which anybody can access  that slavery was abolished at certain dates some  years after muhammed that this was the cause of tensions in the ottoman empire between the arab slave traders and the government etc we also have in the asu library volumes of british documents on slavery where reports and documents concerning slavery all around the world can be found which i checked some of the incidents lewis mentions

so i dont think ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence

i havent read lewiss article so i cant comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings in general so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on islam

his antiislamic polemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling halftruths

again read orientalism by edward said

i am not asking you to take what i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a wellknown book and check the evidence out for yourself

the issue i raised was that slaves were used for sexual purposes when it was claimed that islam prohibits extramarital sex

i wrote that the prophet himself had concubines i wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant etc which is contrary to the notion that sex is for procreation only

in other words such claims are baseless in the quran and the hadith

if slavery is in reality as opposed to in the practice of some muslims opposed by islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too

i seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you

islam is not advocating slavery

slavery was an existing institution in the th century

it advised on slaves being freed for good deeds etc which is nothing new

many cultures saw this as a good thing

what is the problem here

but i can argue rightfully that slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses politically  the quran rewards the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day youll be free

but it is very understandable that i do not communicate with muslims since they assume the quran is from a god and i think it is a rulebased system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo

slaves are a part of this system the subordination of women so that their function in society boils down to childmaking is a part of this system etc

i understand your point of view selim  i think rather it is us who are not getting through to you

some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before

regarding women i have made posting after posting on this subject showing that islam is not antiwoman etc

however have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them

i just reposted a very good one under the title islam and women reposted from socreligionislam

if this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article

imho your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient

regarding slaves my posting on slavery  the second one i made which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year  is based completely on the quran and contains numerous quranic verses and hadiths to support its point of view

our approaches are different  you are arguing from a historical standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the quran and hadiths

now just because people say they are muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of islam even if it is opposed by the quran and sunnah

no

of course not

let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you

the quran prohibits drinking

now if a person says i am a muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that islam teaches that people should drink beer

of course not and only an idiot would think so

do you see my point

it is very natural to think that the authorauthors of the quran had no idea that the socioeconomic structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm shifts in  years in the western cultures  first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution

well rules have changed and the status quo has driven muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a heathen world

muslim countries have failed economically they were unable to accumulate any wealth  directly due to the uncomprimising economic rules in the quran

in fact the rise of islam can easily be modeled after the pyramid effect  you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquering places

you are judging islam here on capitalist terms

capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth  this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings

to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking  islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist

this does not mean that islam does not support a freemarket  for it does in general  but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it

when this stopped you and i were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour

no capital no industry very poor social services  the education level in muslim countries are the lowest in the world the health statistics are miserable etc one can postulate numerous reasons for this

your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist etc

etc

selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that islam  lack of education and power

for a large part of history the islamic world was very powerful

for a significant section of history the islamic world was the foremost in the sciences

so to say that islam is for example antieducation is completely absurd

you try to blame this situation on islam  history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation

you blame muslims for not following the quran but i blame muslims for following the quran

well selim your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of islam

i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are following the quran or not

your idea is baseless from historical facts it is a poor utopia the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage  yet somehow in your theory it is by following the quran that muslims are backwards in education

selim it is your thesis that is antihistorical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory

while my ideas are derived from social and economic history

you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it

so far it seems to me that your view on islam being antieducation is quite contrary to history

that you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this

my solution to all muslims is simple cut the crap i think selim you should consider taking your own advice

get the facts straight here too

and work hard to reverse the effects of  years of ignorance

selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about  or so i think

yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history

selim if i remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from islam

i think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues and start reading some of our postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have

from sandviknewtonapplecom kent sandvik subject re islamic authority over women organization cookamunga tourist bureau lines  in article aprmonuccmonasheduau dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice wrote  the problem with your argument is that you do not know who is a real  believer and who may be faking it

this is something known only by  the person himherself and god

your assumption that anyone who  claims to be a believer is a believer is not necessarily true

so that still leaves the door totally open for khomeini hussein et rest

they could still be considered true muslims and you cant judge them because this is something between god and the person

you have to apply your rule as well with atheistsagnostics you dont know their belief this is something between them and god

so why the hoopla about khomeini not being a real muslim and the hoopla about atheists being not real human beings

 liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes   what if i act morally for no particular reason

then am i moral

what  if morality is instinctive as in most animals

   saying that morality is instinctive in animals is an attempt to  assume your conclusion

   which conclusion

   you conclusion  correct me if i err  that the behaviour which is  instinctive in animals is a natural moral system

  see we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here

earlier you said  that it must be a conscious act

by your definition no instinctive  behavior pattern could be an act of morality

you are trying to apply  human terms to nonhumans

pardon me

i am trying to apply human terms to nonhumans

i think there must be some confusion here

im the guy who is saying that if animal behaviour is instinctive then it does not have any moral sugnificance

how does refusing to apply human terms to animals get turned into applying human terms

 i think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative  this does not prevent his behavior from being moral

im sure you do think this if you say so

how about trying to convince me

  you dont think that morality is a behavior pattern

what is human  morality

a moral action is one that is consistent with a given  pattern

that is we enforce a certain behavior as moral

   you keep getting this backwards

you are trying to show that  the behaviour pattern is a morality

whether morality is a behavior  pattern is irrelevant since there can be behavior pattern for  example the motions of the planets that most all

people would  not call a morality

  i try to show it but by your definition it cant be shown

ive offered four times i think to accept your definition if you allow me to ascribe moral significence to the orbital motion of the planets

  and morality can be thought of a large class of princples

it could be  defined in terms of many thingsthe laws of physics if you wish

however  it seems silly to talk of a moral planet because it obeys the laws of  phyics

it is less silly to talk about animals as they have at least  some free will

ah the law of silly and less silly

what mr livesey finds intuitive is silly but what mr schneider finds intuitive is less silly

now thats a devastating argument isnt it

 didnt you say lucifer was created with a perfect nature

 yes

 define perfect then

 i think you  are playing the usual game here make sweeping statements like omni  holy or perfect and dont note that they mean exactly what they say

 and that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to  contradictions

 im not trying to play games here

but i understand how it might seem that way especially when one is coming from a completely different point of view such as atheism

 take your foot out of your mouth i wondered about that already when i was a catholic christian

the fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why i am an atheist

believe me i believed similar sentences for a long time

but that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims

now god could have prevented lucifers fall by taking away his ability to choose between moral alternatives worship god or worship himself but that would mean that god was in error to have make lucifer or any being with free will in the first place

  exactly

god allows evil an evil if there ever was one

  now thats an opinion or at best a premise

but from my point of view it is not a premise which is necessary true specifically that it is an evil to allow evil to occur

 it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used

letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil is another evil

 but could you give a definition of free will

especially in the  presence of an omniscient being

 will is selfdetermination

in other words god created conscious beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently of god

all will therefore is free will

 the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them

there is no choice left

all is known the course of events is fixed

not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by james tims

if god is omniscient then clearly creating beings with free moral choice is a greater good than the emergence of ungodliness evilsin since he created them knowing the outcome in advance

  why is it the greater good to allow evil with the knowledge that it  will happen

why not make a unipolar system with the possibility of  doing good or not doing good but that does not necessarily imply  doing evil

it is logically possible but your god has not done it

 i do not know that such is logically possible

if god restrains a free beings choice to choose to do evil and simply do not good then can it be said that the being truly has a free moral choice

and if good is defined as loving and obeying god and avoiding those behaviors which god prohibits then how can you say that one who is not good is not evil as well

like i said i am not sure that doing not good without doing evil is logically possible

and when i am not omnipotent how can i have free will

you have said something about choices and the scenario gives them

therefore we have what you define as free will

imagine the following

i can do good to other beings but i cannot harm them

easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds but dont make them long for them so they can not feel the absence of good as evil

but whose case am i arguing

it is conceivable so the omnipotent can do it

or it would not be omnipotent

if you want logically consistent as well you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first

deletion  perhaps it is weak in a way

if i were just speculating about the ubiquitous pink unicorns then there would be no basis for such speculation

but this idea of god didnt just fall on me out of the blue  or while reading science fiction or fantasy

i know that some will disagree  the bible describes a god who is omniscient and nevertheless created beings with free moral choice from which the definitional logic follows

but thats not all there is to it

there seems to be at least in my mind a certain amount of evidence which indicates that god exists and that the biblical description of him may be a fair one

it is that evidence which bolsters the argument in my view

that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible nothing less

and a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god unfortunately there cant be any with these definitions

benedikt

 but we were discussing it in relation to the death penalty

and the constitution need not define each of the words within

anyone who doesnt know what cruel is can look in the dictionary and we did

 or with no dictionary available they could gain first hand knowledge by suffering through one of your posts

 bob beauchaine bobbeviceicotekcom they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea



 there is a good deal more confusion here

you started off with the assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit here you finished up with a recursive definition

murder is objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself requires an appeal to morality

yes

now you have switch targets a little but only a little

now you are asking what is the goal

what do you mean by goal

are you suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere and we form our morals to achieve it

well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and propogation of the species

another example of a moral system is presented within the declaration of independence which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

you see to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system

that is we shall be moral unto what end

murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule

and i thought i had defined murder as an intentional killing of a nonmurderer against his will

and you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not

i fail to see what this has to do with anything

i never claimed that our system of morality was an objective one

i thought that was your very first claim

that there was some kind of objective morality and that an example of that was that murder is wrong

if you dont want to claim that any more thats fine

well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most every moral system

however i am not assuming that our current system and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral

i think that it is a very good approximation but we cant be perfect

and by the way you dont seem to understand the difference between arbitrary and objective

if keith schneider defines murder to be this that and the other thats arbitrary

jon livesey may still say well according to my personal system of morality all killing of humans against their will is murder and wrong and what the legal definition of murder may be in the usa kuweit saudi arabia or the prc may be matters not a whit to me

well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning

in article buedu jaegerbuphybuedu gregg jaeger writes  i hope an islamic bank is something other than bcci which  ripped off so many small depositors among the muslim  community in the uk and elsewhere

 grow up childish propagandist

gregg im really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice things arent quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim them to be upsets you you have done no such thing

bbci was an example of an islamically owned and operated bank  what will someone bet me they werent real islamic owners and operators

an islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules of islam in regard to banking

this is done explicitly by the bank

this was not the case with bcci

and why did these naive depositors put their life savings into bcci rather than the nasty interestmotivated western bank down the street

this is crap

bcci was motivated by the same motives as other international banks with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments

so please dont try to con us into thinking that it will all work out right next time

back to childish propaganda again

you really ought to get a life rather than wasting bandwith on such empty typing

there are thousands of islamic banks operating throughout the world which noone ever hears about

if you want to talk about corrupted banks we can talk about all the people whove been robbed by american banks

 the little things above were in reference to germany clearly

people said that there were similar things in germany but no one could name any

thats not true

i gave you two examples

one was the rather pevasive antisemitism in german christianity well before hitler arrived

the other was the system of social ranks that were used in imperail germany and austria to distinguish jews from the rest of the population

 rushlelandstanfordedu voelkerding writes in article aprseachgcom chrisbseachgcom chris blask writes add to this the outrageous cost of putting someone to death special cell block years of court costs extra guards and the benefits of the death penalty entirely disappear

  thats because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death  overrides the benefit of all the others

obviously its tragic but  it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty

if we went  to war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time  because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then  there is no way to win the war

  yes

fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power  and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of  thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oilhhhkuwait

we won the war  hurrah hurrah

the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media

the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century

this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently

the idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died is ludicrous

not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died and they were the ones being targeted

or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians

either the smart bombs didnt hit their targets and we know they did or they were targeting civilian targets 

which is hardly condusive to destroying iraqs military potential

the military mission planners are not fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a war

hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrantdictator

  ok so some innocent people died

yes maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing  along that road didnt need to be bombed to bits

perhaps that kid with half  his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs werent  entirely guilty

but its worth the death of a few innocents to save the  oilhhhlives of the kuwaiti people isnt it

after all the iraqis may  not have had a chance to vote for saddam but they showed their acceptance of  his regime by not assassinating him right

all that surrendering and  fleeing along open roads was just a devious ploy

we were entirely within  our rights to bomb em just in case without finding out if they were  soldiers

how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in ww

i dont hear you bemoaning them

war is never an exact science but with smart bombs its becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties

sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die

thats war the way it really is

but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like its one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is worse

like patrick henry said some  years ago i know not what course others may take  but as for me give me liberty or give me death

war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free

  the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime but the legal  shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court  battles etc

have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what  it should be

hence the question is do we instate the death penalty as  it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of  it entirely

  yes lets reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be

all that shit  about fair trials and a court of appeals just gets in the way of justice

 lets give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save  ourselves the expense of all those lawyers

  think of the knockon benefits too

la would never have had to spend so  much money cleaning up after riots and holding showcase trials if the cops  had been allowed to do their job properly

a quick bullet through the head  of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been  saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense

  after all if the police decide a mans guilty that ought to be enough

the  fact that the death penalty has been shown not to have any deterrent effect  over imprisonment well thats entirely irrelevant

   mathew   mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here

you come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent

so the iraqi war was wrong eh

im sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww eh

i guess we shouldnt have fought ww either  just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg

how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent

we should have just let hitler take over europe and youd be speaking german instead of english right now

tyrants like hussein have to be stopped

his kind dont understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun

my only regret is that bush wimped out and didnt have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peoples sacrifice not to mention the  americans who died was for naught

liberating kuwait was a good thing but wiping hussein off the map wouldve been better

and as for poor poor rodney king

did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty

those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape

but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen

when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a stateofmind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen

law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops

one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of ones guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict

anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism

subject re political atheists

in article pjbsdjfidoasdsgicom liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes i would say that one innocent person killed is in some sense as bad as many

we certainly feel that way when we punish someone for a single murder

now if we reform system x by reducing the number of deaths by one we produce system xx

id say we should not go back to system x even though by doing so we would reintroduce only a single extra death

 bob seems to think that one is as bad as many in a sense somewhat stronger than the one you indicate

 yes i do

my argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to kill people

that is its primary and i would argue only purpose

to continue to kill people by a practice that has almost no utility especially when you know you will be killing innocents is unconscionable

at the very least the existence of the prison system and our transportation system are based on their merits to society not their detriments

we are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems

one has to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment

just in case i wasnt clear again we maintain a capital punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with no net positive gain

now to the questions 

after claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed then semiretracting that claim by stating that you werent referring to all atheists i asked you to name some atheists who you feel dont fit your patterns to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of

you failed to do so

please do so now

question can you name any aa posters who do not fit into your stereotype

here is the context for the question  this is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line  in assuming that it is

 you however deleted the text further along where i said that i didnt mean to imply that everybodys experience was along the same lines

 whether or not you mean to make such implications you do so repeatedly

 allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheists that youve come across who do not fit into the patterns that you theorize



you have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by and when pressed you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation

i have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason

you failed to do so

please do so now

question can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning

here is the context for the question revelation is not reason and if we do have revelation then reasoning is not all we have

first show me that revelation exists

second if revelation is not perceived through the senses how exactly is it perceived

according to my websters revelation is an act of revealing or communicating divine truth

now tell me how such a thing can be revealed communicated other than via the senses

tell me how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason that is using your brain to interpret what you are sensing

when i say there is no way for a human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as interpreted by reason your brain it is because this is the simple truth

if you have another mechanism of interface by all means share it with us

then later you cannot escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is our senses and our reason period

 again this is indefensible

 no it is simple truth

i challenge you to show me otherwise

then later few mystics will agree to this assertion and the common defense of redefining senses to absorb for instance mystical experiences is begs the question of whether some senses are better than others

 i allow you the broadest definition of senses to make things easier for you

now show me that mystical experiences exist

remember you arent allowed to go by testimony of others eg mystics since you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable  you know tainted by my own bias

further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that persons reasoning capabilities

 i challenge you to show me these things

if you cannot do so you might as well give up the fight

then later let me reiterate you have not explained your interpretation of your experiences so it is not possible for me to have attacked them

in point of fact i specifically challenged you to explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about and i note for the record that you appear to have declined my challenge

 what is it

how is it sensed

how is it interpreted

and how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit of our senses and reasoning abilities

you have answered none of these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims

if you cant answer them your claims are entirely specious



you have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by aa posters are unverifiable and fantastical

i asked you to identify one such claim that i have made

you have failed to do so

please do so now

question have i made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical

if so please repeat them

here is the context for the question i must thank david wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong  posting

then later likewise the reference to unverifiable fantastical claims represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group

 give me your address and ill be pleased to send you a dictionary

failing that can you name one claim that i have made that is in any sense unverifiable or fantastical

i demand that you retract this statement if you cannot offer up evidence

if you follow your usual pattern of ignoring the challenge then you are simply an asshole



first you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldnt help but become atheist

i asked you to explain the contradiction

your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent an opinion not shared by others that i have asked be they atheist or theist

you have failed to answer the question

please do so now

question do you retract your claim that aa posters have not become atheists as a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect

if you dont retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism

here is the context for the question first quote we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is based on reason it is up to atheists to prove it to me  then  second quote but i do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with an atheistic point of view



first you claimed that you would probably not answer these challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous posts

later you implied that you wouldnt respond because i was putting words in your mouth

please clarify this seeming contradiction

question do you prefer to respond to challenges that include context from your own posts or that i paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text

here is the context for the question first you said my ordinary rules are that i dont read articles over over  lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen

these are not rules of morality but practicality

then later if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they cannot be argued with

as usual your responses are awaited with anticipation

dave wood ps for the record below is a compilation of charleys responses to these challenges to date

 this makes no sense to me at all it gives the appearance either of utter incoherence or of answering some question of mr woods imagination

  mr

wood i do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on the net requires any response whatsoever

at some point i might read and respond to your article and then again i might not

my ordinary rules are that i dont read articles over over  lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen

these are not rules of morality but practicality

  i left out something else i dont respond to

 utmost on my list of things to avoid are arguments about the arguments metaarguments as some call them

 when i have to start saying thats not what i said and the response is did so theres no reason to continue

if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they cannot be argued with

keith ryan writes  you will ignore any criticism of your logic or any possible incongruenties in your stance

you will not answer any questions on the validity of any opinion andor facts you state

when i have to start saying thats not what i said and the response is did so theres no reason to continue

if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they cannot be argued with

but of course your version of your position has been included in the charley challenges so your claim above is a flatout lie

further only last week you claimed that you might not answer the challenges because you were turned off by included text

so which is it do you want your context included in my articles or not

come to think of it this contradiction has the makings of a new entry in the next challenges post

by the way ive kept every bloody thing that youve written related to this thread and will be only too pleased to repost any of it to back my position

you seem to have forgotten that you leave an electronic paper trail on the net

this is the usual theist approach

no matter how many times a certain argument has been disproven shown to be nonapplicable or nonsequitur they keep cropping up time after time

speaking of nonsequiturs this has little to do with what i just said

and have some sauce for the goose some of the disproof is fallacies repeated over and over such as the law of nature argument someone posted recently

now now lets not change the subject

wouldnt it be best to finish up the thread in question before you begin new ones

dave wood

but you dont know that capital punishment is wrong so it isnt the same as shooting

a better analogy would be that you continue to drive your car realizing that sooner or later someone is going to be killed in an automobile accident

you know people get killed as a result of driving yet you continue to do it anyway

uh uh

you do not know that you will be the one to do the killing

im not sure id drive a car if i had sufficient evidence to conclude that i would necessarily kill someone during my lifetime

yes and everyone thinks as you do

no one thinks that he is going to cause or be involved in a fatal accident but the likelihood is surprisingly high

just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting blanks does not mean that you are less guilty

i dont know about jon but i say all taking of human life is murder

and i say murder is wrong in all but one situation when it is the only action that will prevent another murder either of myself or another

you mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation

and you should note that that situation will never occur

there are always other options thank killing

why dont you just say that all killing is wrong

this is basically what you are saying

im getting a bit tired of your probabilistic arguments

are you attempting to be condescending

that the system usually works pretty well is small consolation to the poor innocent bastard getting the lethal injection

is your personal value of human life based solely on a statistical approach

you sound like an unswerving adherent to the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few so fuck the few

but most people have found the risk to be acceptable

you are probably much more likely to die in a plane crash or even using an electric blender than you are to be executed as an innocent

i personally think that the risk is acceptable but in an ideal moral system no such risk is acceptable

acceptable is the fudge factor necessary in such an approximation to the ideal

keith

in article aprmonuccmonasheduau dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice writes  and it is he god almighty who created the night and the day and the sun and the earth all the celetial bodies swim along each in its rounded course

holy quran   hmm

this agrees with the ptolemic system of the earth at the centre with the planets orbitting round it

so copernicus and gallileo were wrong after all

 you havent read very carefully  if you look again you will see that it doesnt say anything about what is circling what

 anyway they are not moving in circles

oops sorry my words not the words of the quran

nor is there any evidence that everything goes around in a rounded course in a general sense

wishy washy statements are not scientific

note that the celestial bodies in the above verse is an interpolation which is why it is in brackets  it is the translators incorrect imho interpretation

here is maurice bucailles translation he studied arabic for his research into the quran and science of this verse god is the one who created the night the day the sun and the moon

each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion

quran  the positive aspect of this verse noted by dr maurice bucaille is that while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time and for a long time afterwards there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse or anywhere in the quran

fred rice dariceyoyoccmonasheduau

 of course bobby then states that satan has no free will that  he does as god wants him to

this brings up a host of  paradoxes is god therefore evil do i have free will  or is god directing me also if god is evil which part  of his infinite self is good and which is evil etc

 i would like for once a solid answer not a runabout

 i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one i simply dont agree  with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force

 i wrote  the belief to which i ascribe is that evil is not a creation  rather it is the absence of good

this fits with all the  logic about things having dual use eg a knife can be used  to sculpt and it can be used to kill

like entropy evil is  seen in this view as neither force nor entity

satan is  therefore metaphorical

in fact there are several verses  of the holy quran which appear to support this view and several  traditions as well

  for example there is a tradition that food should never be left open  on a shelf or table overnight lest satan enter it

it appears  that this is a reference to as yet undiscovered germs thus the  evil effect of spoiled food is described as satan

but there are many examples of satan personified

which am i  to believe

 and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the  holy quran the bible etc

there have been times in the spiritual  and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical  descriptions of heaven hell and satan were taken quite literally  and that worked for the time

as i mentioned in the tradition  cited above for example it was sufficient in the absence of a theory  about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil  which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic

which begs the question if satan in this case is metaphorical how can you be certain allah is not the same way

 the bottom line here however is that describing a spiritual plane  in human language is something like describing color to a person  who has been blind from birth

you may want to read the book  flatland if you havent already or the dragons egg

the first  is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con  cept some deleted for space saving  when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe  another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers then  such conventions as metaphor allegory and the like come to be  necessary

the unseen is described in terms which have reference  and meaning for the readerlistener

but like all models a compro  mise must be made when speaking metaphorically clarity and directness  of meaning equivalence of perception and the like are all  crippled

but what else can you do

this is why i asked the above

how would you then know god exists as a spirit or being rather than just being metaphorical

i mean its okay to say well satan is just metaphorical but then you have to justify this belief and justify that god is not some metaphor for something else

i say this because there are many many instances of satan described as a being such as the tormentor in the old testament book of job or the temptor in the new testament gospels

in the same way god too is described as a being or spirit

how am i to know one is metaphorical and not the other

further belief in god isnt a bar to evil

lets consider the case of satanists even if satan were metaphorical the satanist would have to believe in god to justify this belief

again we have a case where someone does believe in god but by religious standards they are evil

if bobby does see this let him address this question also

deleted some more on metaphor  obviously more philosophizing on this issue is possible but im  not sure that the readers of this newsgroup would want to delve  into religious interpretation further

however if anyone wishes  to discuss this im certainly willing either off line  email  or  on line  posting

it wouldnt be sufficient cause to bitch to the system operator if this was just some guy saying that atheists are going to hell

the point was that recently many messages were posted from that address

each of these messages was posted to a different newsgroup with the apparent intent of provoking the readers of that particular group

this along with the fact that these posts were written in allcaps makes these posts suspect

whoever is using this account is using it irresponsibly

if it is the intended user they should consider appropriate action

if it is someone else which seems a possibility then this is also reason to report it

it is only because i have seen posts on other groups by this user that i am considering action

brendan

 you know it just occurred to me today that this whole christian thing  can be blamed solely on mary

  so shes married to joseph

she gets knocked up

what do you think  ol joe will do if he finds shes been getting around

so mary comes up  with this ridiculous story about god making her pregnant

 nice attempt chris 





verrry close

you missed the conspiracy by  step

joseph knew who knocked her up

he couldnt let it be known that somebody else got ol mary prego

that wouldnt do well for his popularity in the local circles

so what happened is that she was feeling guilty he was feeling embarrassed and they decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been the downfall for both

clever indeed

come to think of it 





i have gained a new respect for the couple

maybe joseph and mary should receive all of the praise being paid to jesus

dave buckminster fuller how is that one o keeper of the nicknames 

 some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows

who would die for a lie

wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar

people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed

call me a fool but i believe he did heal people

anyone who dies for a cause runs the risk of dying for a lie

as for people being able to tell if he was a liar well weve had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of civilization

if david copperfield had been the messiah i bet he could have found plenty of believers

jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer and he wasnt the first to be witnessed

what sets him apart

 niether was he a lunatic

would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy

very doubtful in fact rediculous

for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away

rubbish

nations have followed crazies liars psychopaths and megalomaniacs throughout history

hitler tojo mussolini khomeini qadaffi stalin papa doc and nixon come to mindall from this century

koresh is a nonissue

 therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing

take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course

there are flaws in your logic everywhere

and as im sure others will tell you read the faq

 some other things to note

he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone

this in his betrayal and crucifixion

i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it

of course you have to believe the bible first

just because something is written in the bible does not mean it is true and the age of that tome plus the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible

so if you do quote from the bible in the future try to back up that quote with supporting evidence

otherwise you will get flamed mercilessly

 i dont think most people understand what a christian is

it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches

rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for gods sake

he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same

hey we cant do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him

thats tuff and most people dont want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at

but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time

we dont rush it in one day christianity is your whole life

it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while

we box everything into time units

such as work at this time sports tv social life

god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves

just like weight lifting or guitar playing eh

i dont know how you define the world total but i would imagine a total sacrafice sp of everything for gods sake would involve more than a time commitment

you are correct about our tendency to box everything into time units

would you explain how one should involove god in sports and hehehe television

unfortunately      most jews did not survive

    that sure sounds to me like ken is accusing the guy of being a nazi

  hitler and the nazis didnt spring fully formed from the forehead  of athena

they didnt invent antisemitism

they built on a  foundation of antisemitism that was already present in germany

 this foundation of antisemitism was laid down not by the nazis  but by the people i listed and also by hundreds of years of unthinking  kneejerk bigotry on the part of perfectly ordinary people and of  course their pastors and priests

  what we have to worry about today is not whether some hollywood  hitler in a black uniform is going to come striding onto the german  stage in one unprepared step but whether those same bedrock foundations  of antisemitism are being laid down little by little in germany  as we speak

  and if so they will be laid down not by hitlers and himmlers who  will come later but by people like the poster in question

the  people who think that casual antisemitism is acceptable or even fun

   deletions  i did

now may i suggest with the greatest possible respect that  you go read some history

  jon

so you consider the german posters remark antisemitic

perhaps you imply that anyone in germany who doesnt agree with israely policy in a nazi

pray tell how does it even qualify as casual antisemitism

if the term doesnt apply why then bring it up

bb bb  it doesnt make a rainbow any less beautiful that we  gods name is smack  understand the refractive mechanisms that chance to  for some

 produce it

jim perry perrydsinccom   alice in chains  

first ill make the assumption that you agree that a murderer is one who has commited murder

well id say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder

for instance if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks and someone was killed with such a gun the person who actually performed the action isnt the murderer but i guess this is actually made clear in the below definition

id be interested to see a more reasonable definition

what do you mean by reasonable

otherwise your inductive definition doesnt bottom out your definition in essence is that murder is the intentional killing of someone who has not commited murder against his will

expanding the second occurence of murder in the above we see that  yes it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition

but even though the series is recursively infinite i think the meaning can still be deduced

i assume you can see the problem here

to do a correct inductive definition you must define something in terms of a simpler case and you must have one or several bottoming out cases

for instance we can define the factorial function the function which assigns to a positive integer the product of the positive integers less than or equal to it on the positive integers inductively as follows math lesson deleted okay lets look at this situation suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past

each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family

now lets suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times

or if you dont like dealing with infinities suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing

that is there is a neverending loop of slayings based on some nonexistent travesty

how do you resolve this

well they are all murders

now i suppose that this isnt totally applicable to your problem but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system

and in any case the nested murderer in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive given the finite existence of humanity

and a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved

so the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer

is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition

see in a totally objective system where all the information is available such a nested definition isnt really a problem

keith

he stated that thousands of bibles were discovered at a certain point in time which were syllableperfect

this therefore meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted by my acquaintance was approximately  years after the death of jesus

this is as far as i know complete nonsense

the codification of the bible as we have it now came very much later

c wingate  the peace of god it is no peace  but strife closed in the sod

mangoecsumdedu  yet brothers pray for but one thing tovemangoe  the marvlous peace of god

 more horrible deaths resulted from atheism than anything else

there are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both atheists and theists

im sure bobby can list quite a few for the atheist side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at genocide

perhaps since im a bit weak on history somone here would like to give a list of wars causedled by theists

i can think of a few hitler claimed to be a christian for example but a more complete list would probably be more effective in showing bobby just how absurd his statement is

 peace on a side note i notice you always sign your posts peace

perhaps you should take your own advice and leave the atheists in peace with their beliefs

 bobby mozumder nanci 

if you know and are sure of the author of this quote please send me email nmwandrewcmuedu lying to ourselves is more deeply ingrained than lying to others

 many atheists do not mock the concept of a god they are shocked that  so many theists have fallen to such a low level that they actually  believe in a god

you accuse all atheists of being part of a conspiracy  again without evidence

  rule  condescending to the population at large ie theists will not  win many people to your faith anytime soon

it only ruins your credibility

fallacy  atheism is a faith

lo

i hear the faq beckoning once again wonderful rule  deleted  youre correct you didnt say anything about a conspiracy correction hard atheism is a faith

 rule  dont mix apples with oranges

how can you say that the  extermination by the mongols was worse than stalin

khan conquered people  unsympathetic to his cause

that was atrocious

but stalin killed millions of  his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist state

how can  anyone be worse than that

i will not explain this to you again stalin did nothing in the name of atheism

whethe he was or was not an atheist is irrelevant

get a grip man

the stalin example was brought up not as an indictment of atheism but merely as another example of how people will kill others under any name thats fit for the occasion

 rule  if you rely on evidence state it

were waiting

as opposed to relying on a bunch of black ink on some crumbling old paper atheism has to prove nothing to you or anyone else

it is the burden of dogmatic religious bullshit to provide their evidence

which we might you be referring to and how long are you going to wait

so hard atheism has nothing to prove

then how does it justify that god does not exist

i know theres the faq etc

but guess what  if those justifications were so compelling why arent people flocking to hard atheism

theyre not and they wont

i for one will discourage people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable statements on hard atheism

second what makes you think im defending any given religion

im merely recognizing hard atheism for what it is a faith

and yes by we i am referring to every reader of the post

where is the evidence that the poster stated that he relied upon

  oh yes though im not a theist i can say safely that by definition many  theists are not arrogant since they boast about something outside  themselves namely a god or gods

so in principle its hard to see how  theists are necessarily arrogant

because they say suchandsuch is absolutely unalterably true because  my dogma says it is true

i am not prepared to issue blanket statements indicting all theists of arrogance as you are wont to do with atheists

bzzt

by virtue of your innocent little pronoun they youve just issued a blanket statement

at least i will apologize by qualifying my original statement with hard atheist in place of atheist

would you call john the baptist arrogant who boasted of one greater than he

thats what many christians do today

how is that in itself arrogant

  im not worthy

only seriously misinformed

with your sophisticated putdown of they the theists your serious misinformation shines through

organization cookamunga tourist bureau lines  in article bissdasaturnwwcedu bissdasaturnwwcedu dan lawrence bissell wrote   first i want to start right out and say that im a christian

it  makes sense to be one

have any of you read tony campollos book liar  lunatic or the real thing

i might be a little off on the title but he  writes the book

anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity  in the process he became a christian himself

seems he didnt understand anything about realities liar lunatic or the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of jesus message

sigh it seems religion makes your mindbrain filter out anything that does not fit into your personal scheme

so anyone that thinks the possibilities with jesus is bound to the classical lewis notion of liar lunatic or saint is indeed bound to become a christian

bobby mozumder  snmultbiscritedu  april   the one true muslim left in the world

deleted    over on altatheism we tend to recognise two  categories of atheism

function format due to mathewmantiscouk i think   i weak  notbelievegods   ii strong  believenotgods  deleted     i  am a strong atheist and i must quibble with your assertion  that the strong position requires faith

i believe that no gods  as commonly described by theists exist

this belief is merely an   opinion formed on the basis of observation including a certain   amount of introspection

   i fully accept that i could be wrong and will be swayed by suitably  convincing evidence

thus while i believe that no gods exist this does   not imply faith on my part that it is so

 let me first say that to believe that no gods exist is in fact different than not believing in a god or gods

i will argue that your latter statement i believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith  that is if you are making a positive statement that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i dont know and therefore dont believe in them and dont not believe in then weak atheism

once again to not believe in god is different than saying i believe that god does not exist

i still maintain the position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires faith

but first let me say the following

we might have a language problem here  in regards to faith and existence

i as a christian maintain that god does not exist

to exist means to have being in space and time

god does not have being  god is being

kierkegaard once said that god does not exist he is eternal

with this said i feel its rather pointless to debate the so called existence of god  and that is not what im doing here

i believe that god is the source and ground of being

when you say that god does not exist i also accept this statement  but we obviously mean two different things by it

however in what follows i will use the phrase the existence of god in its usual sense  and this is the sense that i think you are using it

i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god

we also might differ upon what it means to have faith

here is what webster says faith a allegiance to duty or a person loyalty b  fidelity to ones promises  sincerity of intentions a  belief and trust in and loyalty to god  belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  firm belief in something for which there is no proof   complete trust  something that is believed esp

with strong conviction esp a system  of religious beliefs syn see belief one can never prove that god does or does not exist

when you say that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation i will have to ask what observtions are you refering to

there are no observations  pro or con  that are valid here in establishing a positive belief

all observations can only point you in a direction  a direction that we might even be predisposed to by predisposed i mean for example people whoes partents believe in god also tend to

to actually draw a conclusion about the existence or nonexistence of god requires a leap  and you have made this leap when you actively say i believe that god doesdoes not exist

personally i think that both statements are misguided

arguing over the existence of god is precisely the wrong way to find him and yes i use him because a personal god is the only viable concept imo  if a person wants to use she go ahead

of course god is neither he nor she  but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise

just because it is hard for you  to believe this doesnt mean that it isnt true

liars can be very pursuasive  just look at koresh that you yourself cite

this is whole basis of a great many here rejecting the christian account of things

in the words of st madalyn murreyohair face it folks its just silly  why is it okay to disbelieve because of your incredulity if you admit that its a fallacy

bill

but if you were to discuss the merits of racism or its psycholgical benefits you would do well to have experienced it personally

when you speak of experiencing religion you mean someone should believe in a religion

thats right and this is pretty impossible right

it would be ideal if we could believe for a while just to try out religion and only then determine which course of thought suits us best

but again this is not possible

not that religion warrants belief but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits

there are also some psychological burdens too

when you speak of experiencing racism do you mean that someone should believe in racism or that they should have racist things done to them

for parallelism the former must be what you meant but it seems to be an odd usage of the phrase

well if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually believing in racism

of course the parallel happens to be a poor one but you originated it

in any case you are wrong

think of those invisible pink unicorns

also the existence if jesus is not an extradinary claim

i was responding to the historical accuracy of biblical claims of which the existence of jesus is only one and one that was not even mentioned in my post

you may want to complain that the miracles attributed to him do constitute such claims and i wont argue otherwise but that is a different issue

ill take a wild guess and say freedom is objectively valuable

i base this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition almost all would want to complain

therefore i take it that to assert or believe that freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on a rainy day

i take this to be a candidate for an objective value and it it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values such as this exist

you have only shown that a vast majority  if not all  would agree to this

however there is nothing against a subjective majority

in any event i must challenge your assertion

i know many societies heck many us citizens willing to trade freedom for security

whatever promises that have been made can than be broken

john laws a man without the honor to keep his given word

 sgiblabadagiopanasoniccomnntpservercaltechedukeith subject re political atheists

i think an objective morality does exist but that most flavors of morality are only approximations to it

once again a natural or objective morality is fairly easily defined as long as you have a goal in mindthat is what is the purpose of this morality

maybe im not quite getting what you mean by this but i think objective morality is an oxymoron

by definition it seems any goal oriented issue like this is subjective by nature

i dont get how youre using the word objective

but the goal need not be a subjective one

for instance the goal of natural morality is the propogation of a species perhaps

it wasnt really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions to this were necessary

intelligent animals have different needs than the others and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more complicated than the law of the jungle

i dont think that selfactualization is so subjective as you might think

and by objectivity i am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be carried out completely

it was simply a plot device along with me being the keeper o the list to make the obvious play on the last name of fuller and to advance the idea that such a list should be made

i assumed that the ol timers would recognize it for what it is

deletion of course there is also the book of the subgenius and that whole collection of writings as well

does someone know a ftp site with it

benedikt

deletions  the fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie  any actions of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling

the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers

the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well

the crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media

 ps

im not sure about this but i think the charge of shatim also applies to rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the fasad ruling

if this is grounded firmly in islam as you claim then you have just exposed islam as the grounds for terrorism plain and simple

whether you like it or not whether rushdie acted like a total jerk or not there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words

it simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult muslims and their beliefs got that

you do not threaten the life of someone for words  when you do you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position

if you support threatening the life of someone for words you are not yet civilized

this is exactly where i and many of the people i know have to depart from respecting the religions of others

when those beliefs allow and encourage by interpretation the killing of nonphysical opposition

you or i or anyone are more than privledged to believe that someone whether it be rushdie or bush or hussien or whover is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn hisher soul refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with himher peacably demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the miscreants or whatever short of physical force

but once you physically threaten or support physical threats you get much closer to your earlier comparison of rape  with you as the rapist who whines she asked for it look how she was dressed

blaming the victim when you are unable to be civilized doesnt fly

they live in social groups  as we do so they must have some laws dictating undesired behavior

   so why must they have such laws

  the quotation marks should enclose laws not must

oh your highness

and exactly why should the quotation marks enclose laws not must

in case you didnt notice its the function of the must that i wish to ironicise

  if there were no such rules even instinctive ones or unwritten ones  etc then surely some sort of random chance would lead a chimp society  into chaos

perhaps the chimps that failed to evolve cooperative behaviour died out and we are left with the ones that did evolve such behaviour entirely by chance

are you going to proclaim a natural morality every time an organism evolves cooperative behaviour

what about the natural morality of bee dance

jon

humans have gone somewhat beyond what exactly

in one thread youre telling us that natural morality is what animals do to survive and in this thread you are claiming that an omniscient being can definitely say what is right and what is wrong

so what does this omniscient being use for a criterion

the long term survival of the human species or what

well thats the question isnt it

the goals are probably not all that obvious

we can set up a few goals like happiness and liberty and the golden rule etc

but these goals arent inherent

they have to be defined before an objective system is possible

how does omniscient map into definitely being able to assign right and wrong to actions

it is not too difficult one you have goals in mind and absolute knoweldge of everyones intent etc

now you are letting an omniscient being give information to me

this was not part of the original premise

well your original premises have a habit of changing over time so perhaps youd like to review it for us and tell us what the difference is between an omniscient being be able to assign right and wrong to actions and telling us the result is

omniscience is fine as long as information is not given away

isnt this the resolution of the free will problem

an interactive omniscient being changes the situation

which type of morality are you talking about

in a natural sense it is not at all immoral to harm another species as long as it doesnt adversely affect your own i guess

im talking about the morality introduced by you which was going to be implemented by this omniscient being that can definitely assign right and wrong to actions

you tell us what type of morality that is

well i was speaking about an objective system in general

i didnt mention a specific goal which would be necessary to determine the morality of an action

subject re there must be a creator

maybe   science is wonderful at answering most of our questions

im not the type to question scientific findings very often but

personally i find the theory of evolution to be unfathomable

could humans a highly evolved complex organism that thinks learns and develops truly be an organism that resulted from random genetic mutations and natural selection

stuff deleted computers are an excellent exampleof evolution without a creator

we did not create computers

we did not create the sand that goes into the silicon that goes into the integrated circuits that go into processor board

we took these things and put them together in an interesting way

just like plants create oxygen using light through photosynthesis

its a much bigger leap to talk about something that created everything from nothing

i find it unfathomable to resort to believing in a creator when a much simpler alternative exists we simply are incapable of understanding our beginnings  if there even were beginnings at all

and thats ok with me

the present keeps me perfectly busy

from acoopermacccmacalstredu subject idle questions for fellow atheists organization macalester college lines  i wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population

it is rather a ridiculous question in some ways i know but my newsreader is down so i am not getting any new postings for a bit so i figure i might as well post something new myself

also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking

the typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively

but then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it expresses its own selfishness

in article psfinnmudsidsinccom perrydsinccom jim perry writes only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the nature of the novel could think such a thing

this was in response to the claim that rushdie made false statements about the life of mohammed with the disclaimer fiction i know but where is the line between fact and fiction

i stand by this distinction between fiction and false statements however its not for his writing in the satanic verses but for what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is contained in that book

i have yet to find one single muslim who has convinced me that they have read the book

some have initially claimed to have done so but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial newsweek story might impart and all have made factual misstatements about events in the book

 you keep saying things like this

then you accuse people like me of making ad hominem arguments

i repeat as i have said in previous postings on aa i have read tsv from cover to cover i had not seen that claim or i might have been less sweeping

you have made what i consider factual misstatements about events in the book which i have raised in the past in the islam a clearer view thread as well as the root of the yet more rushdie re islamic law thread

my statement was not that you had not read the book but that you had not convinced me that you inter alia had

as i said before if you want to defend your position then produce evidence and respond to the evidence i have posted so far you have not

of course my statement was not directly aimed at you but broadly at a number of muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book indicating that they havent read it and narrowly at gregg jaeger who subsequently admitted that he hadnt in fact read the book vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case

so far the only things i have to go on regarding your own case are a the statements you made concerning the book in the a clearer view posting which i have challenged not interpretation but statements of fact for instance rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of islam as whores and b your claim which i had not seen before this that you have indeed read it cover to cover

i am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation but youll have to support your end by responding to my criticism

i have no doubt as to the ability of a particular muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at but you have upheld the view that tsv is intended as an attack on islam and upon muslims

this view must be defended by more than mere assertion if you want anyone to take it seriously

i am trying very hard to be amicable and rational

and i appreciate it but welcome to the club

i am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated or otherwise insulting attack on islam and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book i have seen is baseless propaganda

i have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with incontext quotes from the book and rushdies essays which is more than my correspondents have done

 jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom writes in article erusnewswwmantiscouk mathew mathewmantiscouk writes  yes

fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power  and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds o  thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oilhhhkuwait

we won the war  hurrah hurrah

  the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and  exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media

the  facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century

  lets analyze this claim a little

how is the size of a war defined

by  number of participants

geographical area

number of countries involved

 number of casualties

size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries too are all measures of size

in this case id say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area

  which other comparable wars are we talking about

vietnam and korea might make good comparisons

  which liberal news media are we talking about

 western news in general but in particular the american mass media cbs nbc abc etc

the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits

 this was due mostly  to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques  which were technically possible only recently

  i suspect that medical advances may have something to do with it too

i agree

  how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in ww

 i dont hear you bemoaning them

  perhaps because the topic hasnt cropped up

if you want my opinion i think  that the blanket bombing of german cities at the end of world war two was the  most appalling act of wholesale slaughter this country has committed in  centuries

bomber harris was no hero of mine

perhaps so

and maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too

but thats easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the s right

back then it was allout war and germany and japan had to be squashed

after all a million or more british had already died hundreds of thousands of french a couple hundread thousand or so americans and millions of russians not to mention a few million jews poles and other people of slavic descent in german concentration camps

all things considered the firebombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses

i for one dont regret it

  war is never an exact science but  with smart bombs its becoming more exact with a smaller percentage  of civilian casualties

sometimes mistakes are made targets are  misidentified innocents die

thats war the way it really is

  entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests without  regard for the lives of other people that is the way war really is

sure

and its the people who suffer because of them

all the more reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests

or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well

  why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet

if  iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before  we started bombing

i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war

it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically

but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the worlds oil supply he had to be stopped

sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the west before hussein invaded kuwait but it is still hussein who is responsible for his decision to invade

and once he did so a strong response from the west was required

  mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here

 you come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although i  feel sure that was not your intent

  whats your intent

to sound like a loving christian

well you arent  doing a very good job of it

well its not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them

or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion

so id have to say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest

  so the iraqi war was wrong eh

im sure that appeasement would have  worked better than war just like it did in ww eh

  who even mentioned appeasement

and what makes you think the situation is  even remotely analogous to world war two

i mentioned it

if we hadnt intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement

it is precisely the lessons the world learned in ww that motivated the western alliance to war

letting hitler take austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww from happening and letting hussein keep kuwait would not have stopped an eventual gulf war to protect saudi arabia

  i guess we  shouldnt have fought ww either  just think of all those innocent  german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg

  yes do

germans are human too you know

 sure

what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich

the consequences stemmed from that

 tyrants like hussein have to be stopped

his kind dont understand  diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun

my only regret is  that bush wimped out and didnt have the military roll into baghdad so  now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peoples sacrifice not to  mention the  americans who died was for naught

  i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet

 what should i say about them

anything in particular

 and as for poor poor rodney king

did you ever stop and think why  the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty

  yes

amongst the things i thought were hmm theres an awful lot of white  people in that jury

so

it was the policemen on trial not rodney king

and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers

if there had been black officers involved im sure their would have been black jurors too

this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow

  those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those  policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape

 but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i  have not seen

  when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone whos lying defenceless on  the ground its rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have  been

so

its hard to imagine

so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical argument

can we expect another revision soon

 just kidding

  if there is some wonderful evidence why is it seemingly being kept secret

 why not tell everyone what it is

then everyone could say oh yes youre  right king deserved a good beating and we could all live happily ever  after

i have to admit that i wonder this too

but neither the prosecution nor the defense is talking

so one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals

  law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused  whether they be criminals or cops

one is not found guilty if there is  a reasonable doubt of ones guilt and only the jury is in a position  to assess the evidence and render a verdict

  fine but im still finding it hard to imagine what the reasonable doubt  was in this case

i mean the cops certainly seem to be beating someone  whos lying defenceless on the ground

whats your explanation

mass  hallucination

orbital mindcontrol lasers

faked video footage

do tell

 ok

it certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved

and frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me too

but then i learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm

a charge which news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under california law

based on what the prosecution was asking for its evident that the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty

note not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm

the seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could

if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one

  science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round  as you would wish it

  you must be using values to mean something different from the way i  see it used normally

  and you are certainly using science like that if you equate it to  the real world

  science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the universe  and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning  those perceptions

science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed interpretations of our observations perceptions

 it has nothing to do with values as far as i can see

 values are  well they are what i value

 they are what i would have rather than not have  what i would experience  rather than not and so on

values can also refer to meaning

for example in computer science the value of  is true and  is false

science is based on commonly agreed values interpretation of observations although science can result in a reinterpretation of these values

 objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are  applicable to everyone

the values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been fully agreed and the change with time

the values of newtonian physic are certainly different to those of quantum mechanics

 in article aprblazecsjhuedu  arromdeejyusenkyoucsjhuedu ken arromdee writes  the automobile system kills nondriving passengers not to mention  pedestrians

you need not drive or even use a car to be killed by one

  indeed and it kills far more than a system of public transport would

i am  therefore entirely in favour of banning private cars and replacing them with  trains buses taxis bicycles and so on

i cycle to work each day and if we could just get those damned cars and their cretinous drivers off the road it would be a lot more fun

 i wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population

probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in emphasis

weekends might not be so inviolate more common to work  days a week in a business and instead of american atheists we would have similar religious organizations

a persons religious belief seems more as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions

of course people would have to come up with more fascinating rationalizations for their actions but that could be fun to watch

it seems to me that for most people religion in america doesnt matter that much

you have extreemists on both ends but a large majority dont make too much of an issue about it as long as you dont

now admittedly i have never had to suffer the bible belt but i am just north of it and see the fringes and the reasonable people in most things tend to be reasonable in religion as well

also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking

the typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively

but then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it expresses its own selfishness

 i dont bother according a higher value to my thinking or just about anybodys thinking

i dont want to fall in that trap

because if you do start that then you are then to decide which is better says whom why is there a best and also what to do about those who have inferior modes of thinking

in qiefkthorusapmchpsnide frankdsuucp writes  in article ursabearcom halatpoohbears jim halat writes   im one of those people who does not know what the word objective means  when put next to the word morality

i assume its an idiom and cannot  be defined by its separate terms

   give it a try

  objective morality is morality built from objective values

  and these objective values are  

please be specific and more importantly motivate

ill take a wild guess and say freedom is objectively valuable

i base this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition almost all would want to complain

therefore i take it that to assert or believe that freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on a rainy day

i take this to be a candidate for an objective value and it it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values such as this exist

somewhere roger colin shouse writes about radical gay dogma

somewhere else he claims not to claim to have a claim to knowing those he doesnt know

there are at least twenty instances of this kind of muddleheaded fourth reichsophistique shit in his postings

maybe more

in fact im not sure the instances could be counted because they reproduce like a virus the more you consider his words

 my question is this what is the best response to weasels like shouse and stan krieger

possibilities  a study them dispassionately and figure out how they work then  remember what youve learned so as to combat them when they or their clones get into office  contribute your insights to your favorite abnormal psych ward  b learn to overcome your repugnance for serial murder this posting is totally uncalled for in recscouting

the point has been raised and has been answered

roger and i have clearly stated our support of the bsa position on the issue specifically that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of the scout oath specifically the promise to live morally straight

there is really nothing else to discuss

trying to cloud the issue with comparisons to blacks or other minorities is also meaningless because its like comparing apples to oranges ie people cant control their race but they can control their behavior

what else is there to possibly discuss on recscouting on this issue

nobody including bsa is denying anybody the right to live andor worship as they please or dont please but it doesnt mean that bsa is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized positive religious and moral standards on which our society has been established and on which it should continue to be based

from sandviknewtonapplecom kent sandvik subject re free moral agency and kent s organization cookamunga tourist bureau lines  in article healtasaturnwwcedu healtasaturnwwcedu tammy r healy wrote  at the time ezekiel was written israel was in apostacy again and if im not  mistaken tyre was about to make war on israel

like i said the prince of  tyre was the human ruler of tyre

he was a wicked man

by calling satan  the king of tyre ezekiel was saying that satan is the real ruler over tyre

tammy is this all explicitly stated in the bible or do you assume that you know that ezekiel indirectly mentioned

it could have been another metaphor for instance ezekiel was mad at his landlord so he talked about him when he wrote about the prince of tyre

sorry but my interpretation is more mundane ezekiel wrote about the prince of tyre when we wrote about the prince of tyre

subject re a visit from the jehovahs witnesses  my syllogism is of the form a is b

c is a

therefore c is b

 this is a logically valid construction

 your syllogism however is of the form a is b

c is b

therefore c is a

 therefore yours is a logically invalid construction and your comments dont apply

if all of those are iss of identity both syllogisms are valid

if however b is a predicate then the second syllogism is invalid

the first syllogism as you have pointed out is validwhether b is a predicate or designates an individual

 in article qinmdspfidoasdsgicom liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes     at any rate even if your interpretation is correct this does   not imply that the killings are religously motivated which was   the original posters seeming claim

   tricky tricky

im replying to your blanket claim that they  are not religiously motivated

  they arent

irish catholics in the south do not kill irish protestants  in the south yet have precisely the same history behind them

those  who think the killings are religously motivated ignore the rather  obvious matter of british occupation partition and misguided patriotism  on both sides

false dichotomy

you claimed the killing were not religiously motivated and im saying thats wrong

im not saying that each and every killing is religiously motivate as i spelled out in detail

  the problems fault along the religious divide because at the historical  roots of this thing we have a catholic country partitioned and populated  by a protestant one

the grotesque killing of soldiers and  civilians is supposedly motivated by patriotism civil rights issues and  revenge

its only difficult to understand insofaras insanity is hard  to understand  religion need not be invoked to explain it

does anyone else see the contradiction in this paragraph

 but to claim that the killings in ni are not religously  motivated

is grotesque

all that means is that the church  and believers are doing what they always do with history  they cant face they rewrite it

  youre attacking a different claim

my claim is that when an ira  terrorist plants a bomb in warrington she does not have as a motive  the greater glory of god

sorry frank but what i put in quotes is your own words from your posting qibechorusapmchpsnide

dont tell us now that its a different claim

if you can no longer stand behind your original claim just say so

why its good to believe in jesus why i know that god exists einstein and god does not play dice everyone worships something why there must be a causeless cause the universe is so complex it must have been designed independent evidence that the bible is true godels incompleteness theorem george bush on atheism and patriotism i know where hell is

biblical contradictions wanted the usa is a christian nation the usa is not a christian nation  subject what is the purpose of this newsgroup

typical posting why have a newsgroup about atheism

why do atheists organize in groups

what is there to discuss

response many things are discussed here including  whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting ones family  prayer in schools  discrimination against atheists  sunday trading laws  the satanic child abuse myth  whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet  how religious societies prey sic on new college students  how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers  whether religion is a danger to society andor the individual  why people become atheists of course inevitably altatheism tends to attract evangelical christians looking for someone to convert

most readers of the newsgroup dont want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly illconsidered or uninformed postings

subject hitler was an atheist

typical posting hitler was an atheist and look at what he did

response adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist

as he said himself the folkishminded man in particular has the sacred duty each in his own denomination of making peoplestopjusttalking superficiallyofgodswillandactuallyfulfillgodswilland notletgodswordbedesecratedorig

ital

for gods will gave men their form their essence and their abilities

anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the lords creation the divine will

therefore let every man be active each in his own denomination if you please and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other

 hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator bydefendingmyselfagainstthejewiam fightingfortheworkofthelordorig

ital

adolf hitler from mein kampf trans

ralph mannheim

of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong

its also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in god

we certainly cant conclude that hes an atheist though

subject the bible proves it typical posting in the bible it says that

response most of the readers of altatheism feel that the bible is of questionable accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before

thus any claimed truth in it is of questionable legitimacy

this isnt to say that the bible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted

many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only is not legitimate

note that this feeling tends to extend to other books

it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion

subject pascals wager typical posting if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing  but if you dont believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell

therefore it is foolish to be an atheist

response this argument is known as pascals wager

it has several flaws

firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow

indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there

this is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem

if a person is a follower of religion x he may end up in religion ys version of hell

secondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not true

suppose youre believing in the wrong god  the true god might punish you for your foolishness

consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer

another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely  or at least that they are of comparable likelihood

if in fact the possibility of there being a god is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive

so sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already

also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on evidence with some amount of intuition

it is not a matter of will or costbenefit analysis

formally speaking the argument consists of four statements 

one does not know whether god exists



not believing in god is bad for ones eternal soul if god does exist



believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist



therefore it is in ones interest to believe in god

there are two approaches to the argument

the first is to view  as an assumption and  as a consequence of it

one problem with this approach in the abstract is that it creates information from no information

this is considered invalid in information theory

statement  indicates one has no information about god  but statement  indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god

this violates information entropy  information has been extracted from no information at no cost

the alternative approach is to claim that  and  are both assumptions

the problem with this is that  is then basically an assumption which states the christian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption

the argument thus collapses to if you are a christian it is in your interests to believe in god  a rather vacuous tautology and not the way pascal intended the argument to be viewed

the biggest reason why pascals wager is a failure is that if god is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager

he will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him

subject what is occams razor

typical posting people keep talking about occams razor

what is it

response william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occams razor

in its original form it said do not multiply entities unnecessarily

that is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do so

nowadays when people refer to occams razor they generally express it more generally for example as take the simplest solution

the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us 

there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural processes



there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there is also a god who created the universe

clearly this god must be of nonzero complexity

given that both explanations fit the facts occams razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two  solution number one

unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution 

there isnt an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there

we just imagine that there is

this third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people find unacceptable

subject why its good to believe in jesus typical posting i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion

response preaching is not appreciated

feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme

such postings do not belong on altatheism and will be rejected from altatheismmoderated try the newsgroup talkreligionmisc

you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would have them do unto you

often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy analogies or parables

be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that god exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it since it tells us nothing we have not been told before

subject why i know that god exists typical posting i know from personal experience and prayer that god exists

response just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist

that evidence varies from person to person

furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things  that they have been abducted by ufos visited by the ghost of elvis and so on

subject einstein and god does not play dice typical posting albert einstein believed in god

do you think youre cleverer than him

response einstein did once comment that god does not play dice with the universe

this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the christian god

used this way it is out of context it refers to einsteins refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory

furthermore einsteins religious background was jewish rather than christian

a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following i believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings

einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer

he believed that qm was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations

so far no such better theory has been found and much evidence suggests that it never will be

a longer quote from einstein appears in science philosophy and religion a symposium published by the conference on science philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life inc new york 

in it he says the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature

for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events

to be sure the doctrine of a personal god interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot

but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal

for a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress

in their struggle for the ethical good teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests

in their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the good the true and the beautiful in humanity itself

this is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task einstein has also said it was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated

i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly

if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it

the latter quote is from albert einstein the human side edited by helen dukas and banesh hoffman and published by princeton university press

also from the same book i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it

of course the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does not in itself imply that christianity is false

subject everyone worships something typical posting everyone worships something whether its money power or god

response if that is true everyone is a polytheist

theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about

if the atheists reactions to for example their families amount to worship then so do the theists

subject why there must be a causeless cause typical posting sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause

response the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has no smallest member

further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion

subject the universe is so complex it must have been designed typical posting the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god

surely you dont think all this appeared here just by chance

response this is known as the argument from design

it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe

those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talkorigins for a while

there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here

however the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of socalled scientific creationism

furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth

the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it cant have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately

but if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely

the approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist position

this leads us to the familiar theme of if a creator created the universe what created the creator but with the addition of spiralling improbability

the only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is or was

from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator

indeed stephen hawking in his book a brief history of time explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end

the argument from design is often stated by analogy in the socalled watchmaker argument

one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach

does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it evolved naturally

of course one assumes a watchmaker

yet like the watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the universe too must have a creator

the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above those common to all arguments by design

firstly a watchmaker creates watches from preexisting materials whereas god is claimed to have created the universe from nothing

these two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak

secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in the world

if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldnt assume it was created by the watchmaker

the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a different part of creation

finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature

yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random but shows elements of order

the watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent

subject independent evidence that the bible is true typical posting the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence

for example

response the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence

early versions of josephuss work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or james the extant version discusses john in a nonchristian context

many scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing but that this was expanded by christian copyists

several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect

much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius about  ce

it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity

it is eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material

aside from the new testament the biographical information about jesus is more welldocumented

for further information please consult the frequently asked questions file for the newsgroup socreligionchristian

subject godels incompleteness theorem typical posting godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the bible to be both true and complete

response godels first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid true or false within that formal system

technically speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system

essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a liar paradox

the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is this sentence is false

note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable

the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims that godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolation

one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of god simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom

this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however

it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with

it may then be possible to show that godels incompleteness theorem holds for that system

however that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists within the system

furthermore it certainly wouldnt tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally

note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of god the formal systems are just abstractions

another frequent claim is that godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that a religious text the bible the book of mormon or whatever cannot be both consistent and universally applicable

religious texts are not formal systems so such claims are nonsense

subject george bush on atheism and patriotism typical posting did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens

response the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i sherman of american atheist press and george bush on august  

sherman is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps

the republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for illinois

the discussion turned to the presidential primary rs what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists

gb i guess im pretty weak in the atheist community

faith in god is important to me

rs surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists

gb no i dont know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered patriots

this is one nation under god

rs do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church

gb yes i support the separation of church and state

im just not very high on atheists

upi reported on may   that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks

the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february  

it can also be found in free enquiry magazine fall  issue volume  number  page 

on october   mr sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane cochairman of the bushquayle  illinois campaign

this concerned a lawsuit mr sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school district  chicago illinois from forcing his firstgrade atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as one nation under god bushs phrase

the following conversation took place rs american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday

does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing

em its bullshit

rs what is bullshit

em everything that american atheists does rob is bullshit

rs thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush campaign is on this issue

em youre welcome

after bushs election american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract his statement

on february st  c boyden gray counsel to the president replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by his original statement and wrote as you are aware the president is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the government

subject i know where hell is

typical posting i know where hell is

hell is in norway

response there are several towns called hell in various countries around the world including norway and the usa

whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it readers of altatheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week

subject biblical contradictions wanted typical posting does anyone have a list of biblical contradictions

response american atheist press publish an atheists handbook detailing biblical contradictions

there is a file containing some biblical contradictions available from the archiveservermantiscouk

see the contacts file for more information

subject the usa is a christian nation typical posting because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers shouldnt the united states be considered a christian nation

response based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear that they never intended the us to be a christian nation

here are some quotes there are many more

what influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society

in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people

rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries

a just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it needs them not

james madison a memorial and remonstrance  i almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preservedthe cross

consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced

john adams in a letter to thomas jefferson history i believe furnishes no example of a priestridden people maintaining a free civil government

this marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose

thomas jefferson to baron von humboldt  i cannot conceive otherwise than that he the infinite father expects or requires no worship or praise from us but that he is even infinitely above it

benjamin franklin from articles of belief and acts of religion nov    subject the usa is not a christian nation typical posting is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any sense founded upon the christian religion

response no

the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the  treaty of tripoli  stat  treaty series  article  as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion  as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of musselmen  and as the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries

the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections such as charles bevans treaties and other international agreements of the united states of america  vol

pp



the english text of the treaty of tripoli was approved by the us senate on june   and ratified by president john adams on june  

it was recently discovered that the arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation it lacks article xi altogether

the person who translated the arabic to english was joel barlow consul general at algiers a close friend of thomas paine  and an opponent of christianity

it is possible that barlow made up article xi but since there is no arabic version of that article to be found its hard to say

in  a new treaty of tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation

in article aprmonuccmonasheduau dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice writes   do women have souls in islam

 people have said here that some muslims say that women do not have souls

i must admit i have never heard of such a view being held by muslims of any era

i have heard of some christians of some eras holding this viewpoint but not muslims

are you sure you might not be confusing christian history with islamic history

  yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the turkish caliphate

 i am not aware of any turkish caliphate viewpoint on this

can you reference

however i found a quote due to imam ali whom the shias follow men never obey your women in any way whatsoever

never let them give their advice on any matter whatsoever even those of everyday life

indeed allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away ones wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth

we see them without religion when alone they are left to their own devices they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake

it is easy to enjoy them but they cause great anxiety

the most virtious among them are libertines

but the most corrupt are whores

only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice

they have three qualities particular to miscreants they complain of being oppressed whereas it is they who oppress they make oaths whereas they are lying they pretend to refuse mens solicitations whereas they desire them most ardently

let us beg the help of god to emerge victorious from their evil deeds

and preserve us in any case from their good ones

quote from masud alqanawi ref

a bouhdiba sexuality in islam p 

i wouldnt consider this quote as being exemplary of the islamic tm viewpoint though

for all we know the prophets cousin and the fourth khalif hazreti ali may have said this after a frustrating night with a woman

from rashid subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law nntppostinghost  organization nh lines   what about the twelve imams who he considered incapable of error  or sin

khomeini supports this view of the twelve imans

this is  heresy for the very reasons i gave above

i would be happy to discuss the issue of the  imams with you although my preference would be to move the discussion to another newsgroup

i feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate

the topic is deeply embedded in the world view of islam and the esoteric teachings of the prophet sa heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally if at all concerned with the metaphysical substance of mans being and nature

a good introductory book in fact one of the best introductory books to islam in general is murtaza mutahharis fundamentals of islamic thought  god man and the universe  mizan press translated by r campbell

truly a beautiful book

a followup book if you can find a decent translation is wilaya  the station of the master by the same author

i think it also goes under the title of master and mastership  its a very small book  really just a transcription of a lecture by the author

the introduction to the beautiful psalms of islam  translated by william c chittick available through muhammadi trust of great britain is also an excellent introduction to the subject

we have these books in our university library  i imagine any well stocked university library will have them

from your posts you seem fairly well versed in sunni thought

you should seek to know shiite thought through knowledgeable shiite authors as well  at least that much respect is due before the charge of heresy is levelled

will is selfdetermination

in other words god created conscious beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently of god

all will therefore is free will

the above is probably not the most representative paragraph but i thought id hop on anyway what strikes me as selfcontradicting in the fable of lucifers fall  which by the way i seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text but my ex rcism may be showing  is that as benedikt pointed out lucifer had perfect nature yet he had the free will to choose evil

but where did that choice come from

we know from genesis that eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was satan but how did lucifer discover invent create call the action what you will something that god had not given origin to

also where in the bible is there mention of lucifers free will

we make a big fuss about mankind having free will but it strikes me as being an afterthefact rationalisation and in fact like salvation not one that all christians believe in identically

at least in my mind salvation and free will are very tightly coupled but then my theology was roman catholic

still how do theologian explain lucifers fall

if lucifer had perfect nature did man

how could he fall

how could he execute an act that a contradicted his nature and b in effect cause evil to exist for the first time

lucio de re lucioproximaaltza  tab stops at four

of course if at some later time we think that the death penalty is cruel or unusual it will be outlawed

but at the present most people dont seem to think this way

this from the same fellow who speaks of an objective or natural morality

i suppose that if the majority decides slavery is ok then it is no longer immoral

i did not claim that our system was objective

keith

the positive aspect of this verse noted by dr maurice bucaille is that while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time and for a long time afterwards there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse or anywhere in the quran

there is no notion of heliocentric or even galacticentric either

my sole intention was learning to fly

i want to know how this omniscient being is going to perform the feat of definitely terming actions right or wrong

if you were omniscient youd know who exactly did what and with what purpose in mind

then with a particular goal in mind you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance with the general goal

i dont think youve show the existence of any objective moral system

they exist but in practice they are difficult to perfectly emulate

i mean you understand the concept of an objective system right

i thought you were explaining it to us

i certainly dont understand what you are explaining

in an objective system there are known goals

then actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals or not

simple

the problem with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ

that is the goals of each society are different

note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one

the concept of innocence is dependent on whether certain actions are right or wrong and this depends on the moral system

but if we have an objective system then someone can be deemed innocent or not quite easily by an omniscient person

anyway i think i cleared up the recursive definition of murder because no one is complaining about it

i dont think it solves anything to speculate where we would be if we did have an objective moral system

the question is still whether you can even say what one is

ive said it many many times

and for what its worth i dont think you cleared up anything concerning murder

which part do you have a problem with

what do you mean by harmed

is it harm if you have to spend your existence metabolising food for another species

oh most moral systems would be considered only within a species

it is okay for us to enslave other animals right

but not humans of course ideally perhaps we wouldnt even have to bother any other animals one the first point its wrong to enslave humans according to my persoanl moral system

on the second point im a vegetarian

but we can enslave the animals right

but just not kill them

or are you a vegetarian for health reasons

so are you a vegetarian

no

i fail to see how my personal views are relevant anyway

is it wrong to eat animals in your personal moral system

of course not

it seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species for food

it might be nice though if the other animals were not made to suffer

for instance a cow in a field lives out its life just about the same way it would in the wild

they seem happy enough

however the veal youngsters arent treated very well

how about an objective moral system

i dont know

what is the goal of this particular system

there is no inherent system

how about a natural moral system

nope

again it seems okay to kill other species for food

lines  you blashephemers

you will all go to hell for not believing in god

be prepared for your eternal damnation



 the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was

or he was just convinced by religious fantasies of the time that he was the messiah or he was just some rebel leader that an organisation of jews built into godhood for the purpose off throwing of the yoke of roman oppression or  some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows

who would die for a lie

are the moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into jewish embassies dying for the truth hint they think they are

were the nazi soldiers in wwii dying for the truth

people die for lies all the time

wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar

people was hitler a liar

how about napoleon mussolini ronald reagan

we spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying

so the answer is no they wouldnt be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things

gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed

call me a fool but i believe he did heal people

why do you think he healed people because the bible says so

but if god doesnt exist the other possibility then the bible is not divinely inspired and one cant use it as a piece of evidence as it was written by unbiased observers

 niether was he a lunatic

would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy

very doubtful in fact rediculous

for example were hitler or mussolini lunatics

how about genghis khan jim jones there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics

anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away

 therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing

so we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad

 some other things to note

he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone

this in his betrayal possibly selffulfilling prophecy ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general public had access

possibly also that the text is written in such riddles like nostradamus that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional prophecy

and crucifixion

i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it

stuff about how hard it is to be a christian deleted i severely recommend you reconsider the reasons you are a christian they are very unconvincing to an unbiased observer

so you are saying that it isnt possible for an instinctive act to be moral one

that is in order for an act to be an act of morality the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard it

from nyedacnsvaxuwecedu david nye subject re after  years can we say that christian morality is organization university of wisconsin eau claire lines  reply to frankdsuucp frank odwyer im one of those people who does not know what the word objective means when put next to the word morality

i assume its an idiom and cannot be defined by its separate terms

give it a try

objective morality is morality built from objective values

from a dictionary of philosophy by anthony flew objectivism the belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired

for instance no one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering might be thought of as a plausible example

even in a world of sadists who all rejected it the contention remains true just as      remains correct even if there is no one left to count

the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established

if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world

nor can they be analytic since this would involve lack of actionguiding content one ought always to do the right thing is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action see analytic and synthetic

at this point the objectivist may talk of selfevident truths but can he deny the subjectivists claim that selfevidence is in the mind of the beholder

if not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true

the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself

to hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity

cwainwright eczcawmipsnottacuk wrote deletions   it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function deletions  so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children

 hmmno wonder the world is overpopulated

obviously you keep to the  monty python song every sperm is sacred

and if as you say it has  a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own  arguement natural

 consider the context im talking about an evolutionary function

one of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate those who dont have no purpose in that context

oh

i guess all those social insects eg

ants bees etc

which have one breeding queen and a whole passel of sterile workers are on the way out huh

 these days is just aint true

people can decide whether or not to have  children and when

soon they will be able to choose its sex c but thats  another arguement so its more of a lifestyle decision

again by  your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they  must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children

both are  as unnatural as each other

 yet another nonsequitur

sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental

that homosexuals dont procreate means that sex is only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose

i refer you to the bonobos a species of primate as closeley related to humans as chimpanzees that is very closely

they have sex all the time homosexual as well as heterosexual

when the group finds food they have sex

before the go to sleep at night they have sex

after they escape from or fight off prdators they have sex

sex serves a very important social function above and beyond reproduction in this species

a species closely related to humans

there is some indication that sex performs a social function in humans as well but even if not this shows that such a function is not impossible

you cant just pick your two favorite trends notice a correlation in them and make a sweeping statement of generality

i mean you can and people have but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis

at best its a gross oversimplification of the pushpull factors people experience

 basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society are far too complicated for us to control

we just have to hold on to the panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing

but one things for sure depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not due solely to sex out of marriage

note that i never said that depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is due solely to extramarital sex

i specifically said that it was a prime cause of this not the prime cause or the only cause of this  i recognize that there are probably other factors too but i think that extramarital sex and subsequent destabilization of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in psychological problems including depression in the west in the th century

cclumistacuk kutlukcclumistacuk kutluk ozguven writes atheists are not mentioned in the quran because from a quranic point of view and a minutes reasoning one can see that there is no such thing

 but there are people who say that they are atheists

if they arent atheists what are they

when the quran uses the word din it means way of individual thinking behaving communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs

this is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion

the atheists are not mentioned in the quran along with jews mushriqin christians etc

because the latter are all din

to have a din you need a set of beliefs assumptions etc to forma a social code

for example the marxist have those such as history conflict etc

that they do not put idols sometimes they did to represent those assuptions does not mean they are any different from the other mushriq or roughly polytheists

there cannot be social atheism because when there is a community that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate the society

when they inscribe assumptions say nation or progress is the natural consequence of human activity or parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government however they individually insist they do not have gods from the quranic point of view they do

therefore by definition atheism does not exist

we are a atheist society in fact means we reject the din other than ours

atheism can only exist when people reject all the idolsgodsdogmas suppositions of the society that they part and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief and quran tells about such deviations and disbelief

but as i mentioned from a quranic point of looking at things there is no atheism in the macro level

from mangoecsumdedu charley wingate subject re who says the apostles were tortured

lines  the traditions of the church hold that all the apostles meaning the  surviving disciples matthias barnabas and paul were martyred except for john

tradition should be understood to read early church writings other than the bible and heteroorthodox scriptures

c wingate  the peace of god it is no peace  but strife closed in the sod

mangoecsumdedu  yet brothers pray for but one thing tovemangoe  the marvlous peace of god

the argument goes as follows qoid quotes appear in john but not in the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke

however they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and not an entirely different source

assuming you are presenting it accurately i dont see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion

the material in john im not sure exactly what is referred to here but ill take for granted the similarity to the mattluke q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john getting it straight from jesus mouth

we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors

the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages

it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark

the version of the usual theory i have heard has matthew and luke independently relying on mark and q

one would think that if luke relied on matthew we wouldnt have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing

as it is assumed that john knew the content of lukes text

the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly

this is the part that is particularly new to me

if it were possible that you could point me to a reference id be grateful

unfortunately i havent got the info at hand

it was i think in the late s or early s and it was possibly as old as ce 

when they are from about  why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three

because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing copy quit a bit

the further away from the original the more copies can be written and therefore survival becomes more probable

and i dont think a one step removed source is that bad

if luke and mark and matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then i really cannot believe in the sort of big transformation from jesus to gospel that some people posit

in news reports one generally gets no better information than this

and if john is a diciple then theres nothing more to be said

that john was a disciple is not generally accepted

the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument

im not really impressed with the theology argument

but im really pointing this out as an if

and as i pointed out earlier one cannot make these arguments about i peter i see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter

one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times

compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies

the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is not so bad

in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak

but the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case its agreed that the most important epistles predate mark

from lnewnhambradfordacuk leonard newnham subject re islam and scientific predictions was organization university of bradford uk lines  xnewsreader tin version 

pl umar khan khanitditdnrlnavymil wrote i strongly suggest that you look up a book called the bible the quran and science by maurice baucaille a french surgeon

it is not comprehensive  he was unable to find a wealth of scientific statements in the holy quran but what he did find made sense with modern understanding

so he investigated the traditions the hadith to see what they had to say about science

they were filled with science problems after all they were contemporary narratives from a time which had by pour standards a primitive world view

his conclusion was that while he was impressed that what little the holy quran had to say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the holy quran did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in the traditions

how would a man of th century arabia have known what not to include in the holy quran assuming he had authored it

this book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue

the book is in two sections

section  contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the bible showing many inconsistencies between the bible and modern science

well we all know that no surprises

section  analyses the korans version of the old testament stories and seems on the face of it to present a good case showing the koran is consistent with modern science

however it was plain to me that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the koran

take the flood for example the bible is full of detail forty days and forty nights pair of every animal etc we all know this is nonsense

the korans description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as a big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage

yes no contradiction but also not much fact

the koran might be consistent with modern science but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time does not seem much of an achievement

the book concludes by saying something like the koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of to us now ridiculous ideas about the universe and none of them can be found in the koran

arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme

the above is of course from memory so i may have missed some points

furthermore to take the law into ones own  hands is a criminal act as these are matters for the state not for  individuals

nevertheless khomeini offered a cash prize for people to  take the law into their own hands  something which to my  understanding is against islamic law

yes this is also my understanding of the majority of islamic laws

however i believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all five schools of law  sunni and  jaffari can be levelled against muslim or nonmuslims both within and outside daralislam

i do not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and open hostility to islam falls into this category of the law

i do know that historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone by the death penalty

my understanding is that khomeinis ruling was not based on the law of apostasy alone

it was well known that rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the quran hadith or in islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy

i believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that of fasad

this ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals

the reward was not offered by khomeini but by individuals within iran

 stuff deleted  also i think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that  khomeinis fatwa was issued due to the distribution of the book

my  understanding is that khomeinis fatwa was issued in response to the  writing and publishing of the book

if my view is correct then  your viewpoint that rushdie was sentenced for a crime in progress is  incorrect

 i would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what i remember was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book

however the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges

i remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between britain and iran over the fatwa  iran stressed that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis

but you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa

islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people not books

the rushdie situation was followed in iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa

rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred

fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book he was everywhere in the media

then muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book

rushdie appeared momentarily concerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the muslims and defend his sacred rights

it was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued

the fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie  any actions of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling

the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers

the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well

the crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media

ps

im not sure about this but i think the charge of shatim also applies to rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the fasad ruling

your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable posts

the first i captured was by ken arromdee on  feb  on the subject re atheist too

that was article  here your question was article  which is an average of about  articles a day for the last three years

as others have noted the current posting rate is such that my kill file is depressing large

among the posting i saved in the early days were articles from the following notables  from lorensunlightllnlgov loren petrich from jchristnazarethisraelrel jesus christ of nazareth from mrctomobikichocacwashingtonedu mark crispin from perryapollohpcom jim perry from lipparduavaxccitarizonaedu james j lippard from minskymediamitedu marvin minsky  an interesting bunch

i wonder where  is

 jeff west writes   you claimed that people that took the time to translate the bible would  also take the time to get it right

but here in less than a couple  generations youve been given ample proof agreed to by yourself above  that the new versions tends to be out of step with other modern  translations

  what i said was that people took time to copy the text correctly

 translations present completely different issues

so why do i read in the papers that the qumram texts had different versions of some ot texts

did i misunderstand

jon

  so you consider the german posters remark antisemitic

when someone says so after  years of sightseeing and roaming around its ok to come back kill palastinians and get their land back right

yes thats casual antisemitism

i can think of plenty of ways to criticize israeli policy without insulting jews or jewish history

cant you

hanging

hanging there slowing being strangled would be very painful both physically and psychologicall i imagine

 well most hangings are very quick and i imagine painless

i think this is a misnomer

 firing squad 

 note not a clean way to die back in those days  etc

all would be considered cruel under your definition

all were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers

 and hangings and firing squads are allowed today too

and if these things were not considered cruel then surely a medical execution painless would not be either

but this just shows then that painful execution is not considered cruel and unusual punishment

this shows that cruel as used in the constitution does not refer to whether or not the punishment causes physical pain

rather it must be a different meaning

id cheat on hillary too

in article cccngbranrlnavymil khanitditdnrlnavymil umar khan writes i just borrowed a book from the library on khomeinis fatwa etc

i found this useful passage regarding the legitimacy of the fatwa it was also common knowledge as prescribed by islamic law that the sentence was only applicable where the jurisdiction of islamic law applies

moreover the sentence has to be passed by an islamic court and executed by the state machinery through the due process of the law

even in islamic countries let alone in nonmuslim lands individuals cannot take the law into their own hands

the sentence when passed must be carried out by the state through the usual machinery and not by individuals

indeed it becomes a criminal act to take the law into ones own hands and punish the offender unless it is in the process of selfdefence

moreover the offender must be brought to the notice of the court and it is the court who shoud decide how to deal with him

this law applies equally to muslim as well as nonmuslim territories

i agree fully with the above statement and is precisely what i meant by my previous statements about islam not being anarchist and the law not being enforcible despite the law being applicable

hence on such clarification from the ulama islamic scholars muslims in britain before and after imam khomeinis fatwa made it very clear that since islamic law is not applicable to britain the hadd compulsory punishment cannot be applied here

i disagree with this conclusion about the applicability of the islamic law to all muslims wherever they may be

the above conclusion does not strictly follow from the foregoing but only the conclusion that the fatwa cannot be enforced according to islamic law

however i do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to rushdie even were it well founded

wow from the above it looks like that from an islamic viewpoint khomeinis fatwa constitutes a criminal act  perhaps i could even go out on a limb and call khomeini a criminal on this basis

certainly putting a price on the head of rushdie in britain is a criminal act according to islamic law

anyhow i think it is understood by knowledgeable muslims that khomeinis fatwa is islamically illegitimate at least on the basis expounded above

others such as myself and others who have posted here particularly umar khan and gregg jaeger i think go further and say that even the punishment constituted in the fatwa is against islamic law according to our understanding

yes

subject re a visit from the jehovahs witnesses  god is eternal

a  b  jesus is god

c  a  therefore jesus is eternal

c  b   this works both logically and mathematically

god is of the set of  things which are eternal

jesus is a subset of god

therefore  jesus belongs to the set of things which are eternal

the first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity statements since the is in those statements is the is of predication rather than of identity

instead they should be translated using a predicate letter

using g to designate god and j to designate jesus and the predicate letter e for the property of being eternal the first premise is eg and the conclusion is ej

the second premise appears to contain an is of identity in which case it can be properly symbolized as j  g but your remark that jesus is a subset of god suggests that strict identity is not desired here

if however the first premise means that all members making up the set god have the property of being eternal the same conclusion follows

 jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom writes in article frusnewswwmantiscouk mathew mathewmantiscouk writes  which liberal news media are we talking about

  western news in general but in particular the american mass media  cbs nbc abc etc

the general tone of the news during the whole  war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely  this cruise missile blew this building to bits

  most odd

over here there was very little about the suffering of the iraqi  civilians until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the  few remaining quality newspapers

true

at first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets

but later and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone

it seemed to me that they didnt have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare

its like they were only progulfwar as long as it was nice and clean smart missiles dropping in on military hqs but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping up

what naive hypocrites

  how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in ww

 i dont hear you bemoaning them

 discussion about blanketbombing and abombs deleted

  all things considered the firebombings and the atomic bomb were  essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick   end to avoid even greater allied losses

i should have said here militarily justified

it seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified

i apologize

  what about the evidence that america knew japan was about to surrender after  hiroshima but before nagasaki

is that another lie peddled by the liberal  media conspiracy

i have often wondered about this

ive always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on japans island fortress of truk

a good inpenatrable military target

the second bomb couldve been held back for use on an industrial center if need be

but i digress

yes i have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb

unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the uss ulimatum

therefore the second bomb was dropped

most unfortunate imo

  i for one dont regret it

  nuke a jap for jesus

 i dont regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people

but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions

  why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet

 if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks  before we started bombing

  i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the  west before the war

it is evident that the west especially america  misjudged hussein drastically

but once hussein invaded kuwait and  threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the worlds  oil supply he had to be stopped

  oh i see

so we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of  people but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gasguzzling car  well the mans gotta go

actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us and allied action

if some backwater country took over some other backwater country we probably wouldnt intervene

not that we dont care but we cant be the worlds policman

or if a coup had occured in kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldnt have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to saudi arabia

but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the wests oil interests caused us to take action

   ive moved a paragraph from here to later on      if we hadnt intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would  have been appeasement

  right

but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action

or  are you just setting up a strawman

 im not setting up a strawman at all

if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait

diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective

 i guess we  shouldnt have fought ww either  just think of all those innocent  german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg

  yes do

germans are human too you know

  sure

what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in  his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich

the consequences  stemmed from that

  translation they were asking for it

 well in a sense yes

they probably had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to

 but what about those who didnt support hitlers dreams of conquest

its  not as if they democratically voted for all his policies

the nsdap got   in the elections of  and that was the last chance the german people got  to vote on the matter

they suffered along with the rest

why does this bother you so much

the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect

many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others

it it regretable but thats thewayitis

there are no perfect solutions

   i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and  tibet

  what should i say about them

anything in particular

  the people of east timor are still being killed by a dictatorship that  invaded their country

hell even western journalists have been killed

all  this was happening before the gulf war

why didnt we send in the bombers to  east timor

why arent we sending in the bombers now

probably because were not the saviors of the world

we cant police each and every country that decides to selfdestruct or invade another

nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places

   heres that paragraph i moved    whats your intent

to sound like a loving christian

well you arent  doing a very good job of it

  well its not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up  nearby countries and keep them

or to allow them to continue with mass  slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion

so id have to  say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the  most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest

  the chinese government has a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization  of tibetans

tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed

amnesty  international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china

  why arent we stopping them

in fact why are we actively sucking up to them  by trading freely with them

tell me how we could stop them and ill support it

i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it

i agree that it is deplorable

  and as for poor poor rodney king

did you ever stop and think why  the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty

  yes

amongst the things i thought were hmm theres an awful lot of white  people in that jury

  so

it was the policemen on trial not rodney king

  erm surely its irrelevant whos on trial

juries are supposed to represent  a crosssection of the population

are they

or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held

normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order

im not an expert on california law or even us law but it seems that this is the way the system is set up

you can criticize the system but lets not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown around

  and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers

  you are saying that black people are not the peers of white people

no not at all

the point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant

  this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow

  this idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them  is really stupid

should the nuremburg trials have had a jury entirely made  up of nazis

germans perhaps

peers doesnt mean those who do the same thing like having murderers judge murderers

it means having people from the same station in life presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendents motivations

  those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those  policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape

 but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i  have not seen

  when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone whos lying defenceless on  the ground its rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have  been

  so

its hard to imagine

so when has argument from incredulity  gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical  argument

  were not talking about a logical argument

were talking about a court of  law

as the faq points out some fallacious arguments are not viewed as  fallacies in a court of law

ok granted

however you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion

this is not a court of law

  if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then  i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one

  were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy

 the media is not totally monolithic

even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneillehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news

there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look

hurrah for rush

btw i never used the word conspiracy

i dont accept without far more evidence theories that there is some allpervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources

 thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing  in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way  as unfortunately it cannot be helped

  jim brown bible for loving christians   thanks mathew i like the quote

pretty funny actually

im a  monty python fan you know

kind of seems in that vein

  of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem  contradictory

but then you know that already

  ha ha only serious

  i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people

  you a supposed christian are arguing that its ok to kill innocent people  so long as you get some guilty ones as well

hardly

i didnt say that its a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just

unfortunately we dont live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions

if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die

i didnt say it is ok  it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary

  i a moral relativist am arguing that saturation bombing of german cities at  the end of world war ii was as far as i can see an evil and unnecessary act

i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering

im not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say

that conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved

and perhaps it was unnecessary as lets say we now know

that doesnt mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didnt see it as being necessary

rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision

at the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it

but dont assume that i feel the bombing was morally justified  i dont

i just dont condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances

  you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i am  in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the  war

you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist

i as an absolutist am in a position to judge but i defer judgment

 you are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular  context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral  now

wrong

they were neither moral then nor now

they seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war

i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision

  wheres your christian love

wheres your absolute morality

oh how quick  you are to discard them when it suits you

as ivan stang would say jesus  would puke

one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum

i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so

i dont believe that you can make the same claim

  mathew and btw the reason i brought up the blanketbombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable

yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasnt accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time

but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm

so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww

even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some civilians suffer

but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history

many iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids

the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk

yes bunk

the us lost  servicemen in ww over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting

but we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of civilian iraqis died in a war lasting about  months

and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that

what hogwash

if hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died it was due to actions hussein took on his own people not due to the allied bombing

regards jim b

i stopped believing in you as well long before the invention of technology

 god  dont listen to this guy hes just a crank

at first this business about being the one true god was tolerated by the rest of us but now it has gotten completely out of hand

besides it really isnt so bad when people stop believing in you

its much more relaxing when mortals arent always begging you for favors

pnanci ann miller writes p pmy favorite reply to the you are being too literalminded complaint is pthat if the bible is really inspired by god and if it is really that pimportant to him then he would make damn certain all the translators and pscribes and people interpreting and copying it were getting it right pliterally

if not then why should i put any merit at all in something pthat has been corrupted over and over and over by man even if it was poriginally inspired by god

p pthe corrupted over and over theory is pretty weak

comparison of the pcurrent hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the text phas in fact changed very little over a space of some two millennia

this pshouldnt be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this manner pare likely to makes some pains to make good copies

well corrupted the first time is good enough

seeing that the bible was constructed  years after jesuss death in the text of merchants ieowe this and owe that i wonder how anyone can take the literal word seriously

obviously it was not intended for such nonsense otherwise the authors of the bible would not need to plagerize sp off of the asians for most of the contents that can be interperated to make sense

from bobbeviceicotekcom robert beauchaine subject nostalgia organization tektronix inc beaverton or

lines  the recent rise of nostalgia in this group combined with the incredible level of utter bullshit has prompted me to comb through my archives and pull out some of the best of altatheism for your reading pleasure

ill post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demands that i stop or i run out of good material

i havent been particularly careful in the past about saving attributions

i think the following comes from john a johnson but someone correct me if im wrong

this is probably the longest of my entire collection

so that the prophecy be fulfilled    in considering the christian religion and judging it according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier jewish prophecy

the scribe matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of jesus of nazareth

as you will see matthews main strategy is to take various old testament passages often not even about the promised messiah and apply them to the circumstances in the new testament

we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts

since the gospels were written at least  years after jesus was executed we do not know how much happened exactly as stated

but for purposes of analysis we will take particular claims at face value

immanuel we begin of course at the beginning

mt 

 mary will bear a son and you joseph will name him jesus which means gd is salvation for he will save his people from their sins

all this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet isaiah 

 in the days of ahaz c  bce king of judah rezin of syria and pekah of israel made war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not quite conquer it

when the house of david ie

ahaz and his court in judah were told of this its heart and the heart of its people shook and the lord gd said to isaiah go to meet with ahaz and the lord spoke to ahaz through prophet isaiah naturally saying ask a sign of gd your lord

it can be as deep as sheol or as high as heaven

but ahaz said i wont ask i will not put the lord to a test

then isaiah said hear then o house of david

is it not enough for you to weary men that you must weary my god too

therefore the lord himself will give you a sign behold a young woman is with child and will bear a son and name him immanuel which means gd is with us

he will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose good

for before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings you dread will have been deserted matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics

further he the hebrew word almah young woman as specifically virgin

but this is not a prophecy about the messiah

it is not a prophecy about an event to happen  years later

it is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother

in short it not about jesus

matthew has made use of a verse out of context and tries to make it fit the specific case of mary

it should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be made to fit mary

mary virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child

of course the fit is shady and has problems

jesus while thought of by later christians to be gd walking among men was never called by the name immanuel

if christianity wished to claim this prophecy for jesus it becomes at best a cutandpaste prophecy a second class prophecy

not too convincing

egypt after jesuss birth in bethlehem matthew tells about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt as if he wishes to liken jesus to moses

this was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king herod

mt 

and remained there until the death of herod

this was to fulfil what the lord had spoken out of egypt i have called my son

what the lord really said was this

hosea 

when israel was a child i loved him

and out of egypt i called my son

the more i called them my people the more they went from me they kept sacrificing to the baals and kept burning incense to idols

matthew conveniently omits the rest of hoseas oracle

but it was indeed israel that once called out of egypt wanted to return

this is history

jesus is certainly not being spoken of here

and if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesus that flees and resists gd

again this prophecy is just not as convincing as matthew probably had hoped

rachel weeps while jesus is off vacationing in egypt matthew says that king herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of all young male children

matthew then writes mt 

by this that which was spoken by the prophet jeremiah was fulfilled a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud lamentation rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they were no more

the reference is to a passage in jeremiah  referring to the carrying off of israel into exile by sargon of assyria in  bce

rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of israel ephraim and manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no more

it is metaphorical of course since rachel lived and dies before the hebrews were even in the egyptian exile

it is interesting to note that it was leah not rachel who was the ancestor of the judeans the land where jesus and bethlehem were

if anyone should do weeping for her children it is leah

the only connexion that rachel has with bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city on the way to ephrath bethlehem

as for herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred

one never knows but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the bible nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time

herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deeds of herod were carefully recorded

this might be a prime example of how events were added to jesuss life to enhance the message of the churchs gospel

because of the whole storys similarity to the tale of the infant moses in egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set up by matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of jesus

it is not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the jeremiah quote

the children the prophet speaks of are not dead but exiled in the assyrian empire

gd comforts the weeping rachel saying that the children will be returned he will gather them back together

of course this would not suit matthews purpose as the children he speaks of are dead for good

again the prophecy matthew sets up is not even that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too convincing

the nazarene we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another matthean prophecy

after leaving egypt joseph  wife take the infant jesus to live in the city of nazareth mt 

that what was spoken of by the prophets might be fulfilled he shall be called a nazarene

first thing we notice is that matthew does not mention the name of the prophets this time

second we have to ask who he is

there are no messianic prophecies speaking of a nazarene

worse there are no prophecies period mentioning a nazarene

still worse there are no nazarenes mentioned in the old testament at all

in the book of judges an angel tells samsons mother that she will judges 

conceive and bear a son

no razor shall tough his head for he will be a nazirite to his god from the day of his birth

he will deliver israel from the hands of the philistines

this is of course not a prophecy of jesus or the messiah of gd

but it is the best that can be found

obviously matthew has begun to go overboard in cutandpaste prophecies in that he is simple making them up now

bearing our diseases jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities

mt 

this was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our diseases

as expected the verse quoted in isaiah is quoted out of context and a few words are skewed to fit the christian scheme

we have is 

surely he the suffering servant has borne our sickness and carried our pains

from a reading of the surrounding passages in isaiah we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of israel jehovahs chosen servant and people

he speaks to the israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it

this image is deeply ingrained in jewish identity an image of a chastised yet cherished israel as the instrument of the nations salvation by gd

the verses speak of israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline

they do not speak of a servant going around and healing people

notice that the servant in isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations and individual jews

jesus as we all know did not take the diseases onto himself

the verses here in isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that had already happened

while it is believed that jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear the illnesses he healed

so while someone might want to say that figuratively jesus reenacted the deeds of israel in his spiritual atonement he has to admit that matthews parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect

silent messiah upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that jesus ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldnt arouse the attention of the local rulers

mt 

this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet isaiah

behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is pleased

i will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the gentiles

he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets

he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his name

the isaiah passage quoted reads is 

behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delights

i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the nations

we will not cry or lift up his voice or make it heard in the street

he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick

he will faithfully bring forth justice

he will not fail burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has established justice in the earth

and the coastlands await his law

you see matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the dealings of jesus

christians could never think of jesus failing never would the light of mankind burn dimly

but the servant nation of israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done

when the gentiles come to embrace gd there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the children of gd

also the ending phrase has been changed from the judaic the coastlands await his law

to the christologic the gentiles will hope in his name

while the original proclaims the torah law of jehovah the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name

if one has any doubt the servant referred to is not jesus one has only to read the whole chapter isaiah  and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and plundered

so we see that when matthews attempt at prophecy is examined it crumbles

three days and three nights now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god jesus himself

he speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection

mt 

for as jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights

before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know how the jews understood days

as far as day names went each was  hours long lasting from sunset pm to the following sunset pm

what was referred to as a day was the period of light from am to the ending sunset at pm

thus according to our time scale a sabbath day began at pm friday evening and lasted until pm saturday evening

this is why the jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturdays instead of sundays

it seems like a real miracle that christians didnt forget that saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week

thus when days and nights are referred to together  hour daylight portions and  hour night periods are being spoken of

thus jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights

as the good book tells us jesus was crucified on the ninth hour which is pm friday afternoon

he then was put into the grave sometime after that

then jesus left the grave rose before dawn of what we call sunday the dawn after the sabbath was over

what this means is that jesus was using our time for clarity in the grave from pm friday night to some time before am sunday morning

we could also add a little time before pm friday since the bible is not specific here

what this means using jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two nights and possibly a couple of hours of one day

certainly this is a problem for jesus prediction

there is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights even using modern time measurements

we then are led to suspect that this error is another one of matthews little mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his gods mouth

and no matter who made the prediction it is more than unconvincing it is counterconvincing

hearing  understanding jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of jesus

he reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants

if the people cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any better

matthew says mt 

with them the audience indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive

because this peoples heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with them her with their ears and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them

the original isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his call to the ministry

this is in  bce when israel is flourishing right before it falls under the authority of assyria

isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from gd calling him to bring reform to israel and judah

is 

and gd said go and say to this people hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceive

make the heart of this people fat make their ears heavy and shut their eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn and be healed

then isaiah said how long lord

and he said until the cities lie waste without inhabitant and houses without men and the land is utterly desolate and the gds take men far away and forsaken places are many in the land

and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is felled

the holy seed is its stump

here we see that it is really gd who causes the people of israel to stop listening to the prophets warnings but reaffirms the promise made to solomons and davids seedlineage

if you read the rest of isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of gd to use israel as a servant a light to the nations

look at isaiah   

we see that matthew has cutandpasted just a little portion of isaiahs verse to suit his own gospel needs

more than that he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didnt understand jesuss stories

and as we see isaiahs verses are not prophecies but rather commands from gd to him in the present

once again matthews prophecy falls flat on its face

matthew tries again to make jesuss parables look like they have the prophetic approval

mt 

he said nothing to them without a parable

this was to fulfil what was spoken of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in parables

i will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the world

matthew really botches up here

he attempts to quote not from a prophet but from the psalms

ps 

i will open my mouth in parable

i will utter dark sayings of old things that we all have heard and known things that our fathers have told us

we will not hide them from their children but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord as was pointed out the verses in the psalms do not really come from a prophet

you might also want to know that earlier copies of matthews gospel even inserted isaiahs name as this prophet

apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up

perhaps the most significant part of this is that once again matthew has altered the old testament scriptures

as jesus has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them

the parables in the psalms are not to be hidden

further they speak of things known that our fathers have told us

jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the world

indeed jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion

this is in direct opposition to the parables in the psalms

no wonder matthew had to rewrite them

and still once again matthews artificial prophecies fall flat on their face

but christians rarely look at this

matthews prophecies arent the only things about christianity that are beginning to look bad

excuses of little faith in mt

 we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons except in one case

not knowing what epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons

it is no wonder that the disciples were unable to dispossess the epileptic

but jesus perhaps no more enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying they didnt have enough faith

this seems strange

why was this demon special

it seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not

apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountains

of course you will find no one these days that can move real mountains

no one parts seas

the only miracles the charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to mexico or some faraway place

major miracles are making some old womans arthritis feel better on sunday morning tv

and the gods including jesus are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts

they are either dead sleeping or hiding in heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone

yet life goes on

tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant time or a distant place

gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days jehovah too

but now they are silent

all the theologians give are various excuses as to why we dont get to see god anymore

were too lazy were not zealous enough were sinful its just his plan we put too many of our own demands on gds appearance if we had the right faith if we were willing to meet gd on his terms

yet even the most pious of men have not seen gd

you dear reader have not seen gd

not literally you know that to be true

i know thats presumptuous and bold

but searching your heart you know what i mean

all that weve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing gd

they say our little faith does not merit us to see gd

sometimes they say see the love in these people you worship with see the lives of people change that is seeing gd

thus people get lulled to sleep satisfied with turning gd into the everyday sights

but that is not seeing gd as i am speaking of it is not seeing gd the way people used to see

what we see in the world that is good is the compassion of human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the forgiveness practised by christian  atheist alike beauty created by the mind of man

these are the things that are done these are what we see

but it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith

jesus rides on an ass shortly after accepting the role of the jewish messiah king jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into jerusalem

mt 

this took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet saying tell the daughter of zion behold your king is coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a asscolt

of course the passage quoted from zechariah 

reads a little differently

lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass colt he will command peace to the nations

there isnt all that much difference here except that zechariah only involves one animal an asscolt while matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently

thus he has jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass

from matthews version we get a comical picture of the divine christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys

this could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma

we find that in the account written earlier by st mark only the colt was called for and brought to jesus

this indeed fits the verses of zechariah properly and shows us that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has bungled

now excluding many respectable christians i have met i have noticed that while christ is thought to have ridden on asses the situation is often reversed nowadays then entering the jerusalem temple the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling jesus the messiah

but jesus replied as we might expect matthew to have done mt 

havent you read

out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise

it is more likely that matthew made this response up since jesus was never one to point out such little prophetic things and since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to fit matthews track record quite well

we might ask jesus or matthew havent you read

for the source reads psalms 

o yahweh our lord how majestic is your name in the whole world

you whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the avenger

the passages hardly need comment

there is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to gd not his messiah king and not jesus

as mentioned it seems to be just one more case of matthews pen making up convenient prophetic scripture

yhvh said to my lord jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised jewish messiahking is to be descended

the jews agree it is king david

but then jesus counters by quoting psalms  the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet

taken at face value jesus is denying the necessity of davidic descent

one assumes he is in opposition to their answer

of course the christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiahking

its tempting to believe this if one is a christian and not interested in matters of investigation

but there are problems

in jesuss time the psalm was thought to be about the messiah

and it is easy to see why david might refer to the messiah as his superior

we need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king bringing the jews to times even better than those under davids rule

of course the jews listening had no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the christians worship

the problem lies in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several jews of jesuss time had also made

one must remember that there were various factions among the jews often as a result of different expectations of the messiahking

jesus was apparently one of these adventists like his audience who thought the messiahs advent was imminent and who interpreted psalms  among others as being messianic

what is the problem then

psalm  literally reads yhvhs utterance to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool

yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion

rule in the midst of your foes

your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountains

you are a priest of the order of melchizedek forever

the word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord

but in the hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalisation exists

adoni simply means lord a generic term as we would use it

it is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to gd

it is merely an address of respect

there is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiahking

that this is supposed to be written by david is not certain

the title of the psalm translates to either a psalm of david or a psalm about david

it seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet about davids covenant and endorsement from gd

if the psalm had been written by david it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah

the idea of a perfect king descended from david was not present in davids age

we have extensive tales of davids doings and sayings none of which include any praises of a messiah

many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after david was dead in times of the exile when gd had put his show of favour for davids kingdom on hold

the description in the psalm fit david very well

david was promised by gd a rise to power victory over his enemies successful judgement among the nations he conquered

he achieved the priesthood common to melchizedek in being a righteous king enabled to bless the people

it all fits

we do not have to blame this problem on matthew alone though

here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though his use of the scripture is rather questionable

still this event is common to the other gospels too

so we let matthew off a little more easily this time

it is interesting to note though how matthew dresses up the event

the earlier gospel of mark tells the tale with jesus simply speaking to a crowd

matthew has the pharisees who became the religious competition of an infant christianity be the target of jesuss question

as we might expect matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the pharisees

such power is the pen

moses  jesus had it together all along we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see a pseudoprophecy in johns gospel

the gospel story of john deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of jesuss career as told by even matthew

but for the moment we will just look at one verse

the early church leaders founded a religion on the jewish hopes of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by gd

when constructing the history of abraham moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people

while this was accomplished eventually under the rule of king david the christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise

but to do so they expanded on the promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom

john 

jc speaking your father abraham rejoiced to see my day

he say it and was glad

it would be nice to tie in approval for jesus from abraham but abraham knew nothing of jesus or a messiah or anything christian

i have tried and failed to find any event in the old testament which corresponds to johns little prophecy

it is par for the course to see st john making up old testament backings just like his forerunner matthew

many christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they still cling to it

the potters field we are told that jesus was betrayed while in jerusalem by one of his followers judas iscariot

matthew writes mt 

and throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple judas departed

but the chief priests taking the silver said it isnt lawful for us to put it in the treasury since it is blood money

so they bought a potters field with it to bury strangers in then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet jeremiah and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of israel and they gave them for the potters field as the lord directed me

this prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of old testament scripture

first matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet

it is zechariah who utters the verses which matthew makes use of

zech



and they weighed out my wages thirty shekels of silver

then yhvh said to me cast them to the treasury the lordly price at which i was paid off by them

so i took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of yhvh

first of all the verses of zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of gd

the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before gd would send judah and israel into conflict with one another

the word treasury had been replaced by the king james scholars with to the potter precisely because this made matthews quote fit better

but this is a blatant error

the correct translation of the hebrew is indeed treasury which also makes perfect sense in zechariahs context whereas potters field is totally unrelated

whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation

however given matthews track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty

of course matthew would have ample reason for altering the text

the thirty pieces of silver match judass situation and if as most christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity matthew might have another prophecy to toss around

however the correct translation of zechariah directly contradicts the situation with judas and the high priests

the high priests would not put the money in the treasury

the worthless shepherd of zechariah does exactly the opposite

of course to the average thursdaynight bible student the prophecy as presented by matthew would be taken at new testament face value

to those matthews work is convincing enough

wine vinegar  casting lots then jesus is led away to be crucified

mt 

they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink it

and when they had crucified him they divided his garments among them by casting lots that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots

first of all the vinegar offered to jesus is actually common sour wine of the type that roman soldiers drank regularly

we find that right before jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him some to drink not polluted with gall

jn 

jesus said i thirst

a bowl of vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth

when he had received the vinegar he said it is finished but matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the prophets but one from the psalms

ps 

i looked for pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none

they gave me poison for food lit

they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee

let them be blotted out of the book of the living

of course the sour wine offered to jesus is done at his request of drink

this does indeed seem to be a show of pity

the psalm quoted is about david and his political and military enemies

it is not about the messiah or jesus

it is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the jesus in the psalm asks gd for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the jesus of the gospels says lk 

jesus said father forgive them the dont know what they do

further matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall a bitter substance put into jesuss drink not his meat as the psalm stipulates

with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask what of the casting of lots

this brings up the nd psalm which deserves discussion all by itself

suffice it now to say that the fact that jesuss clothes were divided as told is no great thing

it turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days

as we will soon see it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to jesus

it does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of jesuss clothes

for a man so removed from worldly possessions his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions

the nd psalm this psalm is attributed to david as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies

it becomes a song of praise to yhvh and of hope

taken out of context parts of it seem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well

we will examine the primary passages

verse  my god my god

why have you forsaken me

why are you so far from helping me far from the words of my groaning

oh my god i cry by day but you dont answer and by night but find no rest

jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross

this suggests that the whole psalm is really about jesus rather than king david

of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to jesus or his execution

jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its shearers

indeed jesus doesnt do much groaning even when on the cross

he certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross

 but i am a worm and no man scorned by men all who see me mock at me

they make faces and wag their heads he committed his cause to yhvh

so let him deliver him for he delights in him

this seems to fit jesuss execution pretty well with the exception of the holy messiah being called a worm

 many bulls encompass me they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion

 yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encircle me they have pierced my hands and feet

i can see all my bones

they divide my garments among them and cast lost for my raiment

 but you yhvh be not far away

deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog

save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull

it would seem quite convincing and im sure the early christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too

unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal flaw

the words have pierced really do not exist in the psalm

the correct hebrew translation is  yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my hands and feet

in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character

the word in the hebrew text is literally like the lion kaari which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer

it is convenience that would urge a christian to change the word to kaaru

but to add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is just what the christian translators have chosen to do

while the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators

apart from the erroneous verse  the psalm does not lend itself to jesus so easily

verse  speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross

this naturally fits the psalms true subject king david

as a side note we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather the forearms

this doesnt say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms

but then facts arent bound by our religious beliefs

matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord jesus

but the psalm like many others was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of jesuss life and death

how much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for christian theology

it is easy to see for those who are not faithful fundamentalists how some of the events in the new testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager matthew

but it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims

so far this has not said good things for st matthew

the reference to the piercing looks a lot like jesuss crucifixion

johns gospel recount written about  years after the fact tells us at jesuss execution jn  but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and out came blood and water these things took place that scripture be fulfilled

the will look on him whom theyve pierced

of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context

prophet zechariah tells us how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them

zc 

and yhvh will give victory to judah and on that day i will seek to destroy the nations that come against jerusalem in judah

and i will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child

johns attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that matthews attempts

matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage

johns errors are grossly obvious and blatant here

it does not speak well for any of the gospel writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded

reckoned with transgressors after his arrest jesus is quickly executed for claiming the jewish kingship messiahship

according to one version of the gospel tale jesus gets executed along with two thieves

mk 

and with him they crucified two robbers one on his right one on his left

and so the scripture was fulfilled which says he was reckoned with the transgressors

here mark is trying to link jesus to a passage in isaiah  about the servant nation of israel

the passage is not about the messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of isaiah  and its surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation

the verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any event

the servant is thought of as a criminal

this also happens to fit the description of jesus

had the passage really been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why executing jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in isaiah

jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry

he was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career

locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons

mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with jesus also reviled him



this is to be expected from a couple of robbers

of course in his later recount st luke decides to change some things

luke tells us lk 

and one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed arent you the messiah

save yourself and us

this certainly fits with marks recount which tells how the people who crucified jesus said save yourself

and that the robbers did the same

but then luke goes on but the other criminal rebuked the first saying dont you fear gd since you are under the same sentence of condemnation

and we indeed justly so for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds

but this man has done nothing wrong

and he said jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom

and jesus answered verily i say to you today you will be with me in paradise

now this little dialogue seems highly contrived

it stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech

we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering

such a man apparently noble and of principle doesnt seem likely to have been a robber

we wonder at the amount of theatrics created by luke

of course lukes recount also disagrees with marks

luke has only one criminal revile jesus not both

it is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of gd do not have this avenue open

this is yet another example of a writer trying to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology

in this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have seen

the end of the world mt

 now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the new testament

it is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity

jesus mentions the destruction of the jewish temples and buildings and his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world which he has been warning about

the disciples tell us when will this the temples destruction be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age

jesus take care that no one leads you astray for many will come in my name saying i am the christ

you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for this must take place but the end is not yet

for nation will rise against nation all this is but the beginning of the birthpangs

they will deliver you up put you to death and false prophets will arise and lead many astray

but he who endures to the end will be saved

this gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a testimony to the nations and then the end will come

so when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet daniel let those who are in judea flee to the mountains

immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn and see the son of man coming and he will send out his angels and gather his elect

learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know that summer is near

so also when you see all these things you will know that he is near at the very gate

truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all these things take place

but of the day and hour no one knows not the angels not the son but only the father

therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect

from this it is clear that jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples

he tells them that although he doesnt know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready

theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error

but unfortunately jesus made himself to explicit

he told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away

there have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the bible and said that the phrase this generation shall not pass away really means this race of people will not pass away of course the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples

it is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn greek he didnt learn it well enough to make himself clear

but

it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples at least some of them are supposed to live to the end of the world

the charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the apostles responses

it becomes abundantly clear from rev

  peter   john  and rev

 that jesus meant exactly what he said

the end was very near

for  years christians have rationalised this th chapter of matthew or ignored its meaning altogether

for  years they have waited for their executed leader to come back hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that he is coming soon

surely he must be

all we must do is wait

can you imagine how tired he must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for just the right moment to spring

so shortly after his crucifixion jesus of nazareth joshuabenjoseph died

it is said that after three days or three days and three nights or three periods of time or three eternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine radiance

then the saviour decided it wasnt in the best interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven

so the story goes anyway

as has been seen there were many things attributed to jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down

to them jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture

we have seen though that this matter is quite shaky

but throughout church history christians have held fast to faith in simple belief

what doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question

to question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters

thus for  years the prophecies cited in the new testament have gone on largely accepted

things may well continue that way for some time

pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of christianity have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support wars and persecution i suppose there is one prophecy of which christianity can securely keep hold

mt 

jesus dont think that i have come to bring peace on earth

i havent come to bring peace but rather a sword

subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say muslim

in general anyone who calls themselves a muslim and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim

thus one who might do things contrary to islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly not become a muslim

if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave islam

you and mr bobby really need to sit down and decide what exactly islam is before posting here

according to zlumber one is not a muslim when one is doing evil

 a muslin can do no evil  according to him one who does evil is suffering from temporary athiesm

now would the members who claim to be muslims get their stories straight

satan and the angels do not have freewill

they do what god tells them to do

keith

and what about that revelation thing charley

if youre talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well its obviously a risk one takes

many people say that the concept of metaphysical and religious knowledge is contradictive

im not an objectivist so im not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization

the problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience

one can get some rough understanding but the language is from the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the perspective of whats being described rather inexact to be charitable

an analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is that the better descriptive language is not available

and in case it holds reliable information can you show how you establish that

from pwwspacsunriceedu peter walker subject re a silly question on xtianity date mon  apr   gmt in article qaqiinngjegapcaltechedu werdnaccocaltechedu andrew tong wrote  so what

 why would the rushdie case be particularly legitimate

as ive said  elsewhere on this issue rushdies actions had effects in islamic  countries so that it is not so simple to say that he didnt commit  a crime in an islamic country

actually it is simple

a person p has committed a crime c in country x if p was within the borders of x at the time when c was committed

it doesnt matter if the physical manifestation of c is outside x

for instance if i hack into nasas ames research lab and delete all their files i have committed a crime in the united kingdom

if the us authorities wish to prosecute me under us law rather than uk law they have no automatic right to do so

this is why the net authorities in the us tried to put pressure on some sites in holland

holland had no anticracking legislation and so it was viewed as a hacker haven by some us system administrators

similarly a company called red hot television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in britain

if they were broadcasting in britain they would be committing a crime

but they are not they are broadcasting from denmark so the british government is powerless to do anything about it in spite of the apparent lawbreaking

of course im not a lawyer so i could be wrong

more confusingly i could be right in some countries but not in others mathew

subject re death penalty was re political atheists

  in aprbatmanbmdtrwcom   responding to dave first with official aa nickname fuller      the death penalty is a deterrent dave

the person executed will never  commit a crime again

guaranteed

   that means that it is an effective antirecidivism measure

it does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place

the true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering

or commiting treason  are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the usa

that is if there were no death penalty would its introduction deter a wouldbe criminal from committing herhis crime

i doubt it

this is only the first step

even if it were a strong deterrent short of being a complete deterrent i would reject it

for what about the case of the innocent executed

and even if we could eliminate this possibility i would reject the death penalty as immoral

this makes me something of a radical on the issue although i think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make

i would if magically placed in charge facilitate stateaided suicide for criminals who have lifesentences

this could be a replacement for capital punishment

those who dont want to live the rest of their lives in jail would always have this option

in article aprmonuccmonasheduau dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice writes deleted to get to the point   therefore in a nutshell my opinion is that premarital sex makes the  likelihood of extramarital sex more probable

furthermore  in my opinion extramarital sex helps break down partnerships and leads  to greater divorce rates

this in turn in my opinion creates trauma  and a less stable environment for children who are then in my opinion  more likely to grow up with psychological problems such as depression  etc

and thus sex outside of marriage is in the long run harmful to  society

i think that you are drawing links where there are none  having sex before marriage has nothing to do with adultery once committed into marriage

the issue as i see it is more of how committed you are to not foisting pain on your spouse and how confident you are about yourself

 in addition what someone does within their marriage is their own business not mine and not yours

i have witnessed strong relationships that incorporate extramarital sex

 i would agree with your assertion about children  children should not be witness to such confusing relationships  if adultery is stressful to adults which i assume it in general is how can we expect children to understand it

  where is the evidence for my opinions

at the moment there are just  generalities i can cite

for example i read that in the th century  the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from  depression has been steadily climbing in western societies probably  what i was reading referred particularly to the usa

similarly one  can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage  in this century in western societies  particularly with the sexual  revolution of the s but even before that i think otherwise the  sexual revolution of the s would not have been possible  particularly with the gradual weakening of christianity and consequently  christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage

i propose  that these two trends  greater level of general depression in society  and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity  are  linked with the latter being a prime cause of the former

i cannot  provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis  seems very reasonable to me and i request that people ponder upon it

why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards depression

you cant just pick your two favorite trends notice a correlation in them and make a sweeping statement of generality

i mean you can and people have but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis

at best its a gross oversimplification of the pushpull factors people experience

my argument is mainly a proposal of what i think is a plausible argument against extramarital sex  one which i personally believe has some truth

my main purpose for posting it here is to show that a plausible argument can be made against extramarital sex

at this stage i am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that just that it is plausible

to try to convince you all of this particular point of view i would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field etc in order to gather further evidence which i simply do not have time to do now

also note that i said that i think extramarital sex is a prime cause in my opinion of the generally greater levels of psychological problems especially depression in western societies

i am not saying it is the prime cause or the only cause just a prime cause  ie

one of the significant contributions to this trend

i think when you say you think my view is simplistic you have forgotten this  i admit that there are probably other factors but i do think that extramarital sex and imo subsequent destabilization of the family is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in western society this century

fred rice dariceyoyoccmonasheduau

 first i want to start right out and say that im a christian

it makes sense to be one

have any of you read tony campollos book liar lunatic or the real thing

i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book

anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself

i assume you are posting to encourage comments  how much history has tony campello read

not much it seems

 the arguements he uses i am summing up

the book is about whether jesus was god or not

i know many of you dont believe but listen to a different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what others have to say

it is good to hear that there are a few reasonable christians about

if only those christian scientists would take note

in australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics

for example there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is  years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been accounted for

   the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was

or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people

did tony follow that one up

 some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows

who would die for a lie

wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar

people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed

millions of people have died for a lie

this point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments work in that way but consider the many aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the spanish invaders

the list is endless

the aztecs lost btw

call me a fool but i believe he did heal people

that is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone to become a christian

more to the point it does not add weight to the claim that jesus was the real thing

 niether was he a lunatic

would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy

very doubtful in fact rediculous

for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away

have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of nazi germany

more to the point did tony mention this

one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his many colleagues fools or illogical men their support of hitler was based i presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles

obviously my argument is invalid if tony thought that hitler was sane  therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing

hmmm

i dont think his arguments warrant the use of a therefore  some other things to note

he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone

this in his betrayal and crucifixion

i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it

this is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions i have had with people result in  quoting the bible

the only reasonable way i think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present

if someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of shit

tonys argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone who thinks the bible is total fiction that jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless

for example in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b

 i dont think most people understand what a christian is

that would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct

it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches

rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for gods sake

he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same

hey we cant do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him

thats tuff and most people dont want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at

but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time

we dont rush it in one day christianity is your whole life

it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while

we box everything into time units

such as work at this time sports tv social life

god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves

i think if you posted this part to altreligion you would get more flames than here 

i have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people

someone famous said that there two evils in life polititians and churchs one rules by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead

if i am pressed i could probably find the exact quotation

cheers charles

well i have typed in the oed definitions

 figuratively

things can be cruel

id imagine nails in your eyes would be very painful

but this does not imply that a painless death is cruel which is what you are supposed to be trying to show

i dont think youre right about germany

my daughter was born there and i dont think she has any german rights eg to vote or live there beyond the rights of all ec citizens

she is a british citizen by virtue of her parentage but thats not full citizenship

for example i dont think her children could be british by virtue of her in the same way

i am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an application for it

it might require immigration to germany but i am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable in this case

more interesting is your sentence in fact many people try to come to the us to have their children born here so that they will have some human rights

how does the us compare to an islamic country in this respect

do people go to iran so their children will have some human rights

would you

more interesting only for your propaganda purposes

i have said several times now that i dont consider iran particularly exemplary as a good islamic state

we might talk about the rights of people in capitalist secular third world countries to give other examples of the lack of rights in third world countries broadly

say for example central american secular capitalist countries whose govts the us supports but who amnesty international has pointed out are human rights vacua

from rayengrlatechedu bill ray subject re the bible and abortion organization louisiana tech university lines  distribution worldlocal nntppostinghost eeengrlatechedu xnewsreader tin version 

pl james j lippard lippardskybluccitarizonaedu wrote  exodus    and if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with  child so that she has a miscarriage yet there is no further  injury he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may  demand of him and he shall pay as the judges decide

  but if there is any further injury then you shall appoint  as a penalty life for life   eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot   burn for burn wound for wound bruise for bruise

 the most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if  men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry the penalty  is only a fine

if however the woman is injured or dies the  lex talionis doctrine of an eye for an eye applies

this is the  jewish interpretation and is supported by jewish commentaries on  these verses

 this is quite an embarrassment for prolifer christians so there is  of course an alternate explanation

the alternative interprets the  word miscarriage to mean premature birthie the child is born  aliveand further injury to mean injury to either the woman or  the fetus

this is not a straightforward interpretation it is not  so far as i know supported by any jewish commentaries and it does  not appeared to be supported by any other part of the bible

what if any historical reference do we have to abortion at this time

did the ancient jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion

i am truly asking not making a point veiled as a question

if there is little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion it is not surprising the bible makes little reference to it as it makes little reference to nuclear power and contamination

while your interpretation is a reasonable one i see no reason to reject the other out of hand

the king jimmy translation says if there is no further mischief

this does not necessarily imply to the woman

i know if my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort we would feel that a life was truly taken not simply a process halted

so you are saying that it isnt possible for an instinctive act to be moral one

i like to think that many things are possible

explain to me how instinctive acts can be moral acts and i am happy to listen

for example if it were instinctive not to murder that is in order for an act to be an act of morality the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard it

weaker than that

there must be the possibility that the organism  its not just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives

so only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other beings mimics theirs

and how much emphasis do you place on intelligence

animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but they dont

are you trying to say that this isnt an act of morality because most animals arent intelligent enough to think like we do

jon

dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice writes my point of view is that the argument all sexism is bad just simply does not hold

let me give you an example

how about permitting a woman to temporarily leave her job due to pregnancy  should that be allowed

it happens to be sexist as it gives a particular right only to women

nevertheless despite the fact that it is sexist i completely support such a law because i think it is just

fred youre exasperating sexism like racialism is a form of discrimination using obvious physical or cultural differences to deny one portion of the population the same rights as another

in this context your example above holds no water whatsoever theres no discrimination in denying men maternity leave in fact im quite convinced that were anyone to experiment with male pregnancy it would be possible for such a future father to take leave on medical grounds

okay

i argued this thoroughly about  weeks ago

men and women are different  physically physiologically and psychologically

much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book brainsex by anne moir and david jessel

i recommend you find a copy and read it

their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced

now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different

maternity leave is an example of this  it takes into account that women get pregnant

it does not give women the same rules it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust

this is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different

now people make the naive argument that sexism  oppression

however maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant

men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the same extent or degree and therefore it is sexist

no matter however much a man wants to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can

and therefore the law is sexist

no man can have access to maternity leave no matter how hard he tries to get pregnant

i hope this is clear

maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women different

there are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book brainsex

your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious

if men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women

to have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is  so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious

you are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women  which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist

the discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities because of her legally determined sexual inferiorities

as i understand most religious sexual discrimination and i doubt that islam is exceptional the female is not allowed into the priestly caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to rights which as an equal human she ought to be entitled to

there is no official priesthood in islam  much of this function is taken by islamic scholars

there are female islamic scholars and female islamic scholars have always existed in islam

an example from early islamic history is the prophets widow aisha who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholar

no matter how sweetly you coat it part of the role of religions seems historically to have served the function of oppressing the female whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where there is no opportunity for selfimprovement or by denying her access to the same facilities the males are offered

you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions and i dispute it

i could go on and on about women in islam etc but i recently reposted something here under the heading islam and women  if it is still at your newssite i suggest you read it

it is reposted from socreligionislam so if it has disappeared from altatheism it still might be in socreligionislam i forgot what its original title was though

i will email it to you if you like

the roman catholic church is the most blatant of the culprit because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy but the other religious are no different let a woman attempt to escape her role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her

your statement that other religions are no different is i think a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than christianity and perhaps judaism

ill accept your affirmation that islam grants women the same rights as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the same position as say khomeini and there are no artificial religious or social obstacles on her path to achieve this

aisha who i mentioned earlier was not only an islamic scholar but also was at one stage a military leader

show me the equivalent of hillary rhodamclinton within islam and i may consider discussing the issue with you

the prophets first wife who died just before the hijra the prophets journey from mecca to medina was a successful businesswoman

lucio you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions

fred rice dariceyoyoccmonasheduau

i think you should support your first claim that people will simply harass me no matter what as i doubt this is true

i think some of the theists will be at a loss and that is enough reason for me

because in god we trust is a motto on the coins and the coins are a representation of the government christians are given ammunition here to slander atheists as unpatriotic

so we should ban the ammunition

why not get rid of the guns

and yes i have heard this used in conversation with christians

sure they may fall back on other things but this is one they should not have available to use

it is worse than others

the national anthem

should it be changed too

god bless america

the list goes on imagine if the next years set of coins were labeled with the motto god is dead

certainly such a statement on us coins would offend almost every christian

and id be tempted to rub that motto in the face of christians when debunking their standard motto slinging gets boring

then youd be no better than the people you despise

any statement printed on an item that represents the government is an endorsement by the government

oh

the coin motto is an endorsement of trusting in god

an endorsement or an acknowledgement

i think gods are things that people are proud of but i dont think the motto encourages belief

i dont particularly feel like trusting in god so the government is putting me down with every coin it prints

is it

 for the motto to be legitimate it would have to read  in god gods or godlessness we trust would you approve of such a motto

whether the motto was intended to be antiatheist or not it turns up as an open invitation to use as an antiatheist tool

and removing the tool will solve the problem

or will it increase the problem

those books can speak far more eloquently than i

one would hope

 bob beauchaine bobbeviceicotekcom they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea



my opinion is that the strong atheist position requires too much belief for me to be comfortable with

any strong atheists out there care to comment

as far as i can tell strong atheists are far outnumbered on altatheism by weak atheists

at the cost of repudiating the faq i think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue although in the context of altatheism where were continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists believe in the nonexistence of god i think the separation is a valid one

to cover my arse what im trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism i wish

whereas i logically can only support the weak atheist position in effect i am a strong atheist and wish i could be a mathematical one

to justify my strong atheist position i believe i need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty

if i read the faq correctly no argument for the existence of god generic as represented by mainstream theologians has ever been found to be unassailable

to me this is adequate evidence that the realgod is undefinable or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight which in turn i accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god

im a little fuzzy on the edges though so opinions are welcome but perhaps we should change the thread subject

lucio de re lucioproximaaltza  tab stops at four

i dont expect the lion to know or not know anything of the kind

in fact i dont have any evidence that lions ever consider such issues

and that of course is why i dont think you can assign moral significance to the instinctive behaviour of lions

what ive been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior

that is it doesnt take much work to be moral but it certainly does to be immoral in some cases

also ive said that morality is a remnant of evolution

our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in the animal kingdom

so you are basically saying that you think a moral is an undefinable term and that moral systems dont exist

if we cant agree on a definition of these terms then how can we hope to discuss them

no its perfectly clear that i am saying that i know what a moral is in my system but that i cant speak for other people

but this doesnt get us anywhere

from pcastermizaruscedu dodger subject gross grosses out dodger fans again

organization university of southern california los angeles ca lines  nntppostinghost mizaruscedu went to the dodgers game tonight  it was cap night

astacio pitched ok but had control trouble all night

in the first he walked a batter balked him to second then a single scored the run with the batter taking second on the throw home

another single made the score  cards

lasorda tried a new line up featuring butler reed and piazza batting third

darryl and eric were benched in favor of snyder and webster

piazza homered in the first to make the score  cards

the dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by offerman

by the fourth inning astacio had already made about  pitches but the score was still 

the dodger defense made several impressive plays

piazza looked great behind the plate gunning down a runner trying to steal second throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base etc

karros also made a spectacular play keeping a ball from going into the outfield

the runner on first was so sure that ball was going through he just kept running past second

karros got up and threw to third and easily got the runner at third

my heart sank in the th when gross got up to warm up in the bullpen

astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter and when gross entered the game with the score still  dodger fans just knew it was over

gross was relieving because he stunk on tuesday pitching just   innings forcing lasorda to use much of his bullpen

the  inning game had the same effect the next nightso only gross was fresh given his light work out tuesday

gross lived up to his name

he walked the first batter gave up a hit to the second and walked the bases loaded

after a grounder resulted in a force at home zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it  cards

gross paid little attention to the runners and the next thing you knew the cards had stolen a fourth run

the runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down but the th run had scored long before that

meanwhile the dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning

lee smith pitched the ninth

he had little trouble getting karros and wallach does anyone have trouble with wallach these days

cory snyder collected his first hit as a dodger a single but that was all the offense the dodgers could mount

smith got his third straight save against the dodgers and all i got was my free dodger cap and a good look at piazza

if piazza keeps this up all year he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors

though its really early karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year

 well officially its the braves

at least up until they started winning  it was

are they still officially

 if so why

and how did they receive this label

  unoffically but without a doubt americas team is the cubs

why

 well my guess is because america loves underdogs

every year no matter  the cubs talent or the predictions they never as close to never as  possible win anything

over the years as the losing has mounted america  has fallen in love with these perennial losers

the cubs have more fans  in chicago then some teams do worldwide

the cubs have more fans  worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined

 an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season  like no one else

including the ws champs it must be that eternal hope

 this is the year

theyve got the talent

theyre off to a good start

 theyve got the pitching or hitting or whatever their strong point is  at the time

its that inevitability that the cubs will eventually  win the ws again

when

only god knows

since its been so long it  could come at any time or it could be another  years

but until they  do finally win and start winning consistently the cubs will remain  americas lovable underdogs

the cubs areamericas team

 orin

 bradley u the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend

the  mets and  orioles are prime examples not the cubs

i root for the cubs because i feel sorry for them but basically they are dogs

the pirates today are a great example of an underdog

if the rockies and marlins compete they will be underdogs

the north stars trip to the stanley cup finals was a good example of an underdogs journey

the cubs have a good team this year and play in a weak division they are much less than americas team

morgan and guzman will have eras  run higher than last year and the cubs will be idiots and not pitch harkey as much as hibbard

castillo wont be good i think hes a stud pitcher this season so far morgan and guzman helped to lead the cubs at top in era even better than the rotation at atlanta

cubs era at 

while braves at  we know it is early in the season we cubs fans have learned how to enjoy the short triumph while it is still there

  polish and jewish are not mutually exclusive

i didnt mean to offend or anything im just quoting stanky himself on the subject

i remember one time last year he was being interviewed by espn and the interviewer cant remember who asked stanky if he was jewish because he the interviewer was jewish and wanted to see more jewish ballplayers

to which stanky replied im polish not jewish

so maybe that wasnt the most pc thing for stanky to say and maybe i was a little naive when i posted it

i think we should just devote this subject to finding actual jewish ballplayers i myself am jewish and the only ones i ever knew until now were koufax greenberg and blomberg

 the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend

the  mets and  orioles are prime examples not the cubs

sorry but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent over  games

i would amend your definition to underdog a team expected to lose but which wins thanks to underestimated talent

the tribe will be in town from april  to the th

there are always tickets available

though they are playing toronto and many toronto fans make the trip to cleveland as it is easier to get tickets in cleveland than in toronto

barry

so far simmons looks like a total idiot

whatever you say

i think its just  games into the season myself so im going to wait a bit before calling names

 i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week

now ottos latest debacle has restored simmons reputation

now he looks like he is back in his  form when he had the als highest era among starters

four our sakenot teds sake i hope he pitches with a 

era for the rest of the season

yeah right

i expect that dave otto will be a really bad pitcher and i have no idea why simmons ever wanted him

on the other hand i expect him to release otto if he doesnt turn things around pretty fast

btw ottos game score for that  ip stinker was only  which points out a problem with the method since ottos performance was infinitely bad and excruciatingly prolonged

 tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing

they are still doing decently

but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse

i think merceds rookie year was a bit flukey but arent you willing to give him some more at bats and tomlin a few more starts before acting so gloomy

 walk well he seems to be on the losing end tonight

but i still think that walk desrved his contract

no he didnt

walk is a time bomb

he has no stuff whatsoever and when the league finally realizes this it wont be pretty at all

 the rookie batters well young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact

other than that their excellent performance hasnt been too much of a surprise

i think we should thank doughty for that

dont be so fast

doughty is the guy who signed steve buechele which was a move that threatened to bury kevin young in the minors

meanwhile im not sure whether doughty or simmons signed martin as a sixyear free agent before the  season

 rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke

twice through the rotation and youve given up

yikes

 slaught how come he wasnt given a contract extension last year

now his value has increased immensely

but so has his age at least in baseball terms

the useful halflife of a  yearold injuryprone catcher cant be much longer than a year

 lonnie smith

well eric davis was signed for a comparable amount

but he wanted to be a dodger and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 

i dont think there was any chance for the bucs to sign him

lets see

eric can hit better

he can run better

he can field better

now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis

an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith

he certainly wasnt last year

even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this yearhe wont be an asset

he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field

hey thats the skates smith package deal

anybody who acquires lonnie for his defense or baserunning particularly at this stage is a real weirdo

 management big big zero

sauer has yet to make a forceful argument in favor of revenue sharing

he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay

if thats the goal of the team ownership than i dont see why sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy

i dont know what he has or hasnt said about revenue sharing so i cant comment there

 alex cole fiasco

 stuff deleted ironically the biggest accomplishment of simmons tenure was getting alex cole really cheap

too bad

that he gave him away in the expansion draft

its annoying but since leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain jeff king it was probably unavoidable

meanwhile i think bigger accomplishments of simmons tenure were getting some value for john smiley not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year drafting well in  letting the rookies show something in 

foley smith and candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts which means that even if fail it hasnt done serious damage to the bucs future

 compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it

the pirates can rant and rave

they will not get those picks

as of now the issue is still being appealed

does this mean that the bucs lost the initial arbitration case

i never heard the outcome of this

when will the final verdict be in on this

now if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots nothing else will

im not sure who was the idiot in this case so i dont know who to blame

it might have been doug danforth after all

in fact i seriously suspect it was doug danforth who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet

in article aprramseycslaurentianca maynardramseycslaurentianca roger maynard writes the facts are that morris  has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a ws winning club

 clemens hasnt

what does it take to play on a ws winning club

we have no way of knowing because we cannot separate morris contribu tion from the rest of the teams

there is only one way of determin ing best in baseball

and that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game

each game determines which team is the best that day

at the end of the season the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division

the playoffs determine the best of the best

but the point is that the only decision making pro cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams

not the individual players

there is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances

and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game

to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab solutely that player as team would have played better with player b in their lineup

sheer speculation

impossible to ascertain

if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria then fine

but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individuals contribution to winning the ws  because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base ball

so until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham pionship more than morris your evaluation of clemens is totally sub jective and is mere opinion

i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon

the fact is that morris didnt win any ballgames toronto did in spite of morris contribution

this has been explained to you exactly

the jays won with morris pitching

and boston wins with clemens pitching

i am not saying that morris is better than clemens

i am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally meaningless and that anyone claiming that clemens is better based on his era has missed the point of what baseball is all about

many many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it

you dont have to be rude

you are completely consumed by the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy

for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy  ignoratio elenchi

i am not saying that morris is better than clemens because he has more rings although i have tongue in cheek claimed that in the past

i am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individuals performance from that of his teams for the purpose of comparing that individuals performance with another individuals per formance

the stats are a nice hobby and thats about it

there is no new knowledge being produced

so when a poster claims that morris is better than clemens because he has more rings the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds

 ok the mets and os are good examples but what about the  reds

i know people who didnt even think theyd win a game let alone win the series

these people were very silly

any team that gets to the world series can win the world series and anybody who ever expects a sweep is crazy

if you put the best team in baseball in the series against the worst team in baseball the worst team would win at least a game most of the time and very well could win the series though the odds would certainly be against them

i kind of doubt that even you agree with it

im not going to go through your points one at a time because after all not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball

im only replying to this because you brought up pam postema the aaa umpire who sued is suing

baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasnt promoted to the majors

jeez

look at pam postema

just because shes a woman everybody on the face of the earth thinks its great that shes getting an opportunity to ump

if you even watched the games and had an iq greater than that of roast beef youd see that she is not nearly as good as most aaa umpires

ive never seen her ump a game

i have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire

but i have seen her on talk shows

and her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most

it seems to me that she is missing the point and if thats how she sees the role of umpires in the game well i wouldnt promote her either

the umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out hell joe lundy could do that

their primary function is to maintain order in the game keep the game moving and keep the players from trying to kill each other

umpires have to be extremely tough people

that disqualifies most of us both men and women

and if ms postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook then i think that disqualifies her as well

umpires need to command the game command of the rulebook is secondary

 hispanic magazineapril  had a couple of interesting articles about hispanic players including its hispanic allstar team

some of the major points are nprs morning edition aired a report this morning  on hispaniclatin american players in mlb and how they have many of the same problems faced by blacknegroafrican american players when they first entered the league

however although baseball has adjusted to the presence of black players many hispanic players still labor under the stereotype of being fireballs hot blooded flashy

the report also emphasised that despite the rantings my word of jessie jackson about baseballs discrimination against black players in its upper echelons baseball has actually done much better by black players than hispanic players

another interesting point was the language barrier problem

the reporter elaborated on an interview with ruben sierra which he gave in spanish to a spanish speaking newspaper reporter with the fact that there are maybe  major baseball writers that speak spanish despite the fact that spanish is one of if not the easiest languages to learn so easy that the author cormac mccarthy learned spanish at age  in order to research his book all the pretty horses

yet few mlb organizations employ spanish speaking personel one of the exceptions being the oakland as

another point nearly  of latin american players have some african blood

yet most report that theyd never really felt black until playing ball in the us

ironically enough it is the early presence of latin american baseball players in the major leagues that support the idea that baseball was integrated before the arrival of jackie robinson as many light black or brown latin americans were incorporated into baseball

me too rbi are a worthless stat

of course so is stolen bases because sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run

and of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases so batting average slugging and obp out too

hmmm i guess homers would not count then either

my point

rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is

and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters

maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are

i just know it

but why would you want to use rbi

rbi is an attempt to measure is some combination of clutch hitting and power hitting

if you believe in clutch hitting then look at how the guy hit with risp

if you want to see how good of a slugger he is then look at his slugging average

in terms of evaluating players rbi totals are better than nothing

but why use them when so many better stats are out there

 correction nied was the only player identified in this book as a grade a prospect who was exposed to the draft according to bill james in the stop the presses section preceding his player evaluations

he valued nied at  and said that nieds value does not increase significantly as a result of his selection although he did catch a break getting away from the strongest rotation in baseball

i thought bill james latest book completely and totally sucked

i bought it but will not purchase anything of his ever again without thoroughly looking at it first

what tripe

the book is inconsistent and filled with selective analysis

james claims to be looking forward and then makes some absolutely bizarre statements of value

not only that but i got the impression he probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name on it

  argh

here is where you are obviously dead wrong

not since the yankees   of the s and s has a team been so nicely setup as this yearsand   years to come braves

i dont think that the allstar team will be able  this may be an appropriate comparison

 the  yankees finshed nd rd and nd finshing    and  games out of first

 in  and  they also finished second  though they were only    and  games out

 even great teams can lose  thats why they play the season

 on the other hand im still picking the braves to go all the way  um surely you didnt intend to compare the  reds with the   philidelphia as

the yankees were finishing nd to  a team that was as good as the  yankees while the  yankees had aged some from their peak years

ruth and gehrig  couldnt play every position simultaneously

  imo given the various ages of the braves and reds this season  that the braves will be closer to their peak while the reds  have slightly passed their peak

  also if youre going to compare braves and yankees a more appropriate  comparison to the  braves might be the  yankees

 after falling short two years in a row in exciting world series  both teams wonwill win the series this year despite the  heroics of some old fart on the other team

perhaps so

i was only responding to the yankees of the s and s part of the comment

if those teams were a sure thing and lost then its probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another team not that i did

these things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real businessman ex  safeway president peter magowan to figure it out

just like he used to tell his checkers if the customers dont come back i dont need as many checkers

this isnt a knock on bob lurie  he was a competent businessman but he didnt deal much with the general public

interesting article craig

its amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers

no other business could ever get away with the th century attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs

i guess the owners look at baseballs high growth rate and ask why its necessary to bring th century business practices into the game but they dont realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of longterm popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans

  i dont know about the tribune but the times has daily coverage and boxscores

 of course they have special emphasis on the yankees and mets beware

the original poster looks to be from louisville and chances are louisville gets the edition of the nytimes that is printed in chicago for the midwest

this edition has boxscores only on monday and sunday and an extremely skimpy sports section few game summaries mostly just color stories

last year i kept saying that slaught should get the bulk of the playing time that he was clearly the better player at this point but leyland insisted on keeping a pretty strict platoon

and now he is released

that doesnt make any sense to me

greg  the story goes like this  spanky is too slow

if he were quicker he would still be here

but with slaught and tom prince they didnt want to lose prince in order to bring up that th pitcher

slaught is about as good as spanky and prince is coming along nicely

well my question still hasnt been answered if spanky was bad enough to release this year why did he get so much playing time last year

yes i know he was part of a platoon and thats why he got more playing time than slaught but that doesnt answer the question

if slaught was so obviously better this year wasnt this also obvious last year and shouldnt he have been taking away some of spankys playing time against righties

from mssnetcomcom mark singer subject darrrrrrrrryl organization netcom online communications services  login guest lines  the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to death but i havent seen anything in rsb yet

gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run

he stroked a line drive into the right field corner

the ball cleared the threefoot high fence and went into the crowd

darryl racing over from right center got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he missed the ball

a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt reached up and caught the ball

home run

now ive seen the replay several times and i have concluded that darryl missed the ball and that the fans glove was essentially behind darryls

several dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with strawberry

what cannot be disputed however is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing

he was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch

that exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry went into a tirade at the man

all reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of costing the dodgers a game

shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch

dodger stadium officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and just relocated him to another area

in an interview after the game lasorda blamed the fan for the loss

strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they dont care about winning

la times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch

before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play

was the fan wrong

should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference

or was he human and just reacting

by the way he is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is impossible

others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of  rbi through the first nine games

i question what he was doing in right center with a lefthanded pull hitter up and the game on the line

had he been closer to the play he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball

but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan

 well my guess is because america loves underdogs

every year no matter  the cubs talent or the predictions they never as close to never as  possible win anything

over the years as the losing has mounted america  has fallen in love with these perennial losers

the cubs have more fans  in chicago then some teams do worldwide

the cubs have more fans  worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined

 an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season  like no one else

including the ws champs it must be that eternal hope

actually i admired the spirit of the fan at the cubs opener several years ago who held up a sign that said wait till next year

this is true but the main thing the commish ie

you cannot allow a team to come out at the ump as the braves did

i usually rip umps but in this case the players were dead wrong

cox should go for  games

if i had ever umped a game where that happened id have ejected every player that came out

but it helps to have  all the recognition hes had plus to play in a city which is  likely to pour in the votes

i like alomar

but id like to differ with your opinion about a city which is likely to pour in the votes

i attended many games last year during the balloting

i know that a great number of the attendees did not fill out their ballots but left them beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands

toronto gets no more and no less votes than any other city for the all star game

unfortunately this is not a one time thing

ive attended games during the last four seasons and it has happened every time

the apathetic attitude to all star ballots really offends me

ljs

 the roar at michigan and trumbull should be loader than ever this year

with  mike illitch at the head and ernie harwell back at the booth the tiger bats  will bang this summer

already they have scored  runs in two games and with  fielder tettleton and deer i think they can win the division

no pitching 

bull

gully moore wells and krueger make up a decent staff that will keep  the team into many games

then there is henneman to close it out

watch out  boston toronto and baltimore  the motor city kittys are back

nice woofing or should i say meowing

and yes the tiggers are a fun exciting team that i would pay to see

but last year they went 

this year their offense is essentially the same and their pitching is at best essentially the same

so why do you think they will suddenly improve to win the  or so games which will be required to win the al

what is the worst start jack morris has had 

  uh jack lost his edge about  years ago and has had only one above  average year in the last  

  again goes to prove that it is better to be good than lucky

you can  count on good tomorrow

lucky seems to be prone to bad starts and a  bad finish last year  

  yes i am enjoying every last run he gives up

who was it who said  morris was a better signing than viola 

 hey valentine i dont see boston with any world series rings on their  fingers

oooooo

cheap shot

  damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his  future

who cares

he had two of them before he came to toronto and if the jays had signed viola instead of morris it would have been frank who won  and got the ring

and he would be on his way to  this year too 

therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best  signing

your logic is curious and spurious

there is no reason to believe that viola wouldnt have won as many games had he signed with toronto

when you compare their stupid wl records be sure to compare their teams offensive averages too

now looking at anything like the morrisviola sweepstakes a year later is basically hindsight

but there were plenty of reasons why it should have been apparent that viola was the better pitcher based on previous recent years and also based on age frank is almost  years younger

how many knew that

people got caught up in the  world series and then on morris  wins last year

wins are the stupidest most misleading statistic in baseball far worse than rbi or r that he won  just means that the jays got him a lot of runs

the only really valid retort to valentine is werent the red sox trying to get morris too

oh sure they said viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say 

and dont tell me boston will win this year

they wont  even be in the top  in the division more like th

if this is true it wont be for lack of contribution by viola so who cares

my question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the death of baseball so strongly

i have seen articles of a similar vein in the chicago tribune and in sports editorials on tv

maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom

these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times losing money bankruptcies at an alarming rate and theres going to be an increased degradation of the product they produce

could you imagine ibm with all their problems promoting themselves the way major league baseball does

their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths not that they are too far from it now 

what would happen at gm

where would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an inferior product because of alleged labor problems

i think it shows a lack of confidence for the people who run the game

anyway it just frustrates me when the media says such things because it inevitably leads to owners trying quick fixes like increasing playoffs to satisfy television or trying interleague play to drum up interest

forget it

word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about a done deal

it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the networks also have to begin soon

mark has driven in   and  

last year mark was batting second primarily and it was his worse year average wise

since he is batting either rd or th this year i predict he will be back up to his previous standards i think he will be better  rbis is not that much of a stretch

from ecaxronmarslercnasagov thu may     baltimore will not fade

they will not win the division this year  but they will finish within five games

i find the prospect of two  orioles winning  each easier to comprehend than that of two sox

 no offense  i think their pitching is about as good as the division  has to offer

the orioles finished seven games out

none of them won  though mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts

 nobody else in the division is worth a darn

they all finish a minimum  of fifteen games out the tribe 

thats another reason to watch  baltimore this year and next  they wont waste many of those games  against the rest of the division

except for the brewers who you probably forgot you were right

the rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre

i do think that the jays have the best talented team in the al east and if we had a good or even average manager we might have a bigger lead right now

i also think that the orioles will not play much better than 

baseball for the rest of the season

jose rijo will win the  cy young award if he is healthy enough to go at least  ip

who would have thought he would try to steal a base

why risk such an injury

he had  ip but didnt win the cy young

maddux surprised all



the orioles will win  games in at least  of the next  years probably the last  and their pitching staff will have a team era among the best  in the al in at least  of the next  years but not necessarily all the same years as they win 

this one will take a long time to verify

i dont think i want to wait that long

but they won  games last year and they were fifth in the league in era

not a bad start



ben mcdonald will not challenge for an era title in the next  years nor will he have  victories either year

by challenge i mean finish among the leaders being among the leaders before the season is done doesnt count

he will probably never be the pitcher he was hyped to be but is still a decent starter to have

looks like it

he wasnt bad last year just too consistent to be an ace

so far this year looks like more of the same



the phillies will give up many fewer walks ifwhen they get rid of their bullpen coach ryan

i am not predicting when or whether they will get rid of him and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust before seeing the radical change

they would have a fine pitching staff if they would just steal ray miller away from pittsburg

the white sox seem to have the same problem but not as bad

i honestly cant say

did they get rid of him

their bb totals were down last year



ricky jordan will have  rbi if he starts  games hitting in the  or  or  spot in any lineup or the  spot in a lineup with very good obp in the  hitters

eli will give cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble a bit from last years pace before coming forth with an offer

from ezdaleucdavisedu gary built like villanueva huckabay subject jose cansecos swing   vs 

organization julio machado candlelight vigil society distribution na lines  was going over some videos last night

studying  and  videotapes of jose canseco proved to be very interesting

and enlightening

heres my analysis of jose canseco circa sep  and jose canseco circa june 



hes bulked up too much

period

he needs to lose about  pounds not gain more bulk



his bat speed has absolutely vanished

conservatively id say hes lost  of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed



that open stance is killing him

note that he acts sort of like brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is released

downing could do this without significant head movement  canseco cant

also note that canseco doesnt always close his stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes theyre fully closed

without a good starting point its hard to make adjustments in your swing

what would i do if i were jose

aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that id never have to work again id restructure my entire swing

first minimize movement before the swing

close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing

hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely

second drop  pounds

cut out the weight work

third relax the wrists

will cost some power but until i can find my  stroke concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up rolling the wrists through the strike zone and hit line drives

his strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park

if cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems hell be out of baseball in three years

if not he could still hit  hr

a friend and i were talking the other day and we were for some reason trying to come up with names of jewish baseball players past and present

we werent able to come up with much except for sandy koufax somebody stankowitz and maybe john lowenstein

can anyone come up with any more

i know it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but humor us

thanks for your help

 hank greenberg would have to be the most famous because his jewish faith actually affected his play

missing late season or was it world series games because of yom kippur the other jewish hofer is rod carew who converted

lowenstein is jewish as well as montanas only representative to the major leagues

undeserving cy young award winner steve stone is jewish

between stone koufax ken holtzman 

might have the wrong pitcher im thinking of the one who threw a nohitter in both the al and nl and big ed reulbach thats quite a starting rotation

moe berg can catch

harry steinfeldt the b in the tinkerseverschance infield

is stanky jewish

or is that just a dave cohen kinda misinterpretation

whatever doesnt look like he stuck around the majors too long

his equivalent average started at

so let us say he had established in his last two seasons a 

level of play

that is good

very good in fact

but it probably doesnt make the top ten in the league

the th best eqa in the al in  was dave winfields 

 thomas was first at  first in the nl was bonds an incroyable 

 tenth was bip roberts 

but 

is better than any season in the past five years by joe carter it is about what mattingly had in  

 what felix jose had the last two years just ahead of time raines fiveyear average better than ryan kleskos mles

he got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing though his hype was a lot better than his hitting

that is the basis for the netcomments about him being overrated

the media would have you beleive he was a great hitter

i think he was a good maybe very good hitter

he was imo something like the th best hitter in the majors

 in article aprulkyvxlouisvilleedu pjtierulkyvxlouisvilleedu writes  everytime i have written on the net about the possibility of a successfuls season by the philadelphia phillies i have gotten ripped from everybody from pittsburgh to calcutta

but if all the ignoramouses care to look at this weeks baseball weekly they will see    that im not the only one who considers then as division winners  the rest of the most respected baseball writers in the country do as well

  and what was the reasoning of this genius writer

that even though their pitching is at best sound they will win on the strength of their offense

lesse   offense   offense  thompson  incaviglia    offense   wins   division winners  at least  wins  so   wins   wins  thompson  incaviglia  therefore   wins  thompson  incaviglia  what did you learn in school today

 if you take a math course and your teacher turns out to be rob rains run dont walk to dropadd

 p tierney   you obviously dont know what the hell youre talking about

no  thompson and incaviglia dont equal  wins but ill take the two  of them over stan javier and ruben amaro 

hr ab   

hr  ab id say this improvement should equate to or   wins at least

  then ill take lenny dykstra who played  games last year and  project his numbers   hits  bs  hr rbi  sb  over  games

thus  hits  bs hr rbi  sb  okay now well put these numbers in the leadoff hole and thus  i have to bump kruk hollins daulton rbi numbers up just a tad  now lesse they knocked in   and  respectively

dont  you think its fair to add about  or  rbi to each

they managed  to knock in a pretty nice amount of runs with a 

leadoff hitter

 okay bozo do you think its fair to add maybe  or  more wins  now

oh and how can i forget wes chamberlain  abs  hr   rbi even with a month and  in aaa and a horrible first half

 well project that over a full season to get  hr and  rbi or so

 is that worth a win or two

  finally take the worse pitching staff in the nl last year add  the worse injury decimation of 

okay now we add danny  jackson some health and a full season for schilling is that  worth at least  wins

  okay weve been conservative and added about  wins so far

now  were adding about  more wins thanks to the expansion teams  okay thats  wins

lesse dipshit math genuious       hmmm

i think thats good enough to win the worse division in  baseball

  next time before you say something foolish get a clue first

  actually i was simply relaying the reasoning of this socalled genius bw writer

i agree

the reasoning was foolish

next time before you say something foolish be aware what you are responding to

btw  wins

very funny

 in article aprptsmotcom epdnptsmotcom writes  this certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any  statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what  percent is fielding

  not yet i wish there were

its much more difficult to tease these apart  than to tease apart scoring runs and preventing runs

and thus we come to one of the true beauties of baseball these things along with many others will never be separated

almost everything in baseball is situational and interdependent

this is what allows us to carry on all the arguments that we have

if everything could be explained and balanced on a statistical basis none of the wonder and mystery would be left

why we might have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself

 shameless woofing deleted on behalf of the rest of us tiger fans out here i appoligize for this shameless woofing

we try to keep it to a minimum but we did win a game the other day so sometimes its hard to control

see phillies fans  michael

 right

so who cares which player gets credited as long as the team gets more runs

if a player helps the team get more r and rbi but doesnt score them all himself who cares

amusing isnt it

seems only the sdcns realize how much baseball is a team game combining efforts from every player for the win

consider the red sox game last night

the sox won  in the bottom of the th

who won the game

clemens pitched a strong nine 

innings allowing only two runs

ryan pitched a couple shutout innings though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so

quantrill pitched a couple of innings gave up the goahead run and got credited with the win when the sox scored two in the bottom of the inning

looks like a team effort to me

yet only quantrill got credit for the win

how about the offense

dawson and vaughn hit i think hrs early in the game

without either one the sox would have lost in nine

quintana led off the th with a solid single

zupcic pinchran for quintana providing the speed to go from first to third when cooper ripped a second single in the inning

melvin avoided the dp getting the run home with a sac fly

not much of a help but it was something

scrub richardson then hit a double scoring the speedy cooper all the way from first

hills lack of defense helped

cooper and zupcic were credited with runs melvin and richardson were credited with rbis

but it seems to me that it was quintanas hit that set up the whole inning

and did melvin really contribute as much as richardson

furthermore people seem to consider rbis to be more significant than runs

did melvin contribute more than cooper

cooper provided the gamewinning baserunner and moved the tying run to third base with only one out

assigning credit based on runs and rbis is clearly ridiculous

you can argue that obp and slg dont show you who came through in the clutch but rrbi dont do any better

at least obp and slg dont claim to try to tell you that

heres to the red sox who contributed to last nights victory

all  of them

from hbrooksuiatmaatmosuiucedu haroldbrooks subject rbi risp and slg organization bills safety cab and record bar chickasha ok lines  off and on over the last several months threads about rbis and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a players rbis using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position risp that he bats with

in the brock model bill james calculated predicted rbis as rbitotal bases  home runs

this completely ignores the context which was all that brock could do since context was unknown to it

so i thought id take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing rbihome runs to slgrisp

ive started with team data using data from the eliass that ive picked up over the years when a i could afford them and b i could stomach the thought of increasing eliass profits

that gave me the years   and 

i dont have team rbis for  or i could add that year

if you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get rbihome runs  slgrisp

the correlation between the lhs and the rhs is  which is significant at a ridiculously high level

so i feel like the fit is good at the team level

ive no started to move on to the player level and have looked at  players will clark ozzie smith joe carter and don mattingly

i hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year

it doesnt do too badly except the equation underpredicts the low hr hitter smith which may be a fault of the model or it could just be ozzie

the results rbihr years actual predicted carter   

clark   

mattly   

smith   

i think we can make a case and i hope to make it stronger that rbis can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up

here is where you are obviously dead wrong

not since the yankees of  the s and s has a team been so nicely setup as this yearsand years  to come braves

the  yankees finshed nd rd and nd finshing   and  games out of first

even great teams can lose  thats why they play the season

on the other hand im still picking the braves to go all the way  um surely you didnt intend to compare the  reds with the  philidelphia as

the yankees were finishing nd to a team that was as good as the  yankees while the yankees had aged some from their peak years

ruth and gehrig couldnt play every position simultaneously

imo given the various ages of the braves and reds this season that the braves will be closer to their peak while the reds have slightly passed their peak

also if youre going to compare braves and yankees a more appropriate comparison to the  braves might be the  yankees

 this is fascinating

you say that alomar was the better hitter last year and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that baerga had a better year

the only category that i see which shows an advantage for alomar is obp hmmmwhat about walks and sb

baerga got clobbered by alomar in obp and beat him in slg by a lesser margin

even putting aside any other factors a player with a  point edge in obp is more productive than a player with a  point edge in slg

the issue has been studied before and i doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way

people see the batting average and the hr but they dont really know their value is worth unless theyve studied the issue closely

the fact is that baerga ate up a lot more outs than alomar while baerga was making outs alomar was drawing walks and being on base for carter winfield etal

benjamin sisko

was going over some videos last night and you wrote an excellent report about it



hes bulked up too much

period

he needs to lose about  pounds  not gain more bulk

 

his bat speed has absolutely vanished

conservatively id say hes  lost  of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed

 

that open stance is killing him

note that he acts sort of like  brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is  released

downing could do this without significant head movement   canseco cant

also note that canseco doesnt always close his  stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes  theyre fully closed

without a good starting point its hard  to make adjustments in your swing

i understand from an unreliable source that canseco was considered expendable by the as when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance

the as brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated if not caused by having a wide open stance closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque thats a paraphrase of what i remember

in any event canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance and the as began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power

aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that id never have to work again id restructure my entire swing

apparently you sound like larussa

second drop  pounds

cut out the weight work

the as also objected about this

if cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems hell be out of baseball in three years

if not he could still hit  hr

but possibly the cause and effect is the reverse of that

 in article adobecom snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being  offense  defense

a run scored is just as important as a run prevented

  this certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any  statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what  percent is fielding

id really like to know

btw sherri thanks for  the da data i find it fascinating

of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented

just as a penny saved is a penny earned

enough with the cliches

my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they wont need much offensive support

i realize this is a big if

this staff leaves the  bosox in the dust

there is no legitimate comparison

two cy young winners and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter

it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs

the team that scores the most runs wins

this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs

a low scoring game would clearly benefit the braves

they should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting

on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers

they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent

the name of the games is to win

even ray knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard

all im trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the braves have the offense doesnt need to be as strong

from djsritvaxiscritedu subject re finnally the phils have support nntppostinghost vaxciscritedu replyto djsritvaxiscritedu organization rochester institute of technology the phillies were picked to be in first

someone replied that the people who picked them were the same people who picked the mets last year

my reply yeah that may be true but this is the phillies

fritz

i love it how all of these people are blaming the phillies success on a weak division

why dont we look at the record of the teams in each division read interdivisional play well see that the east is really kicking the shit out of the west

i know it is early but that is all we have to go on

atlanta is just so strong with their 

ba cincinnati is  coming off a sweep at veterans stadium in philadelphia and houston was swept in its first three games by the phillies in the astrodome

that my western division friends shows that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you think

or you may be posting this way too early and be eating your words by midseason

cmon the phillies havent proved anything yet

atlanta was similar to the phils  years ago

they sucked

they started having a good year but didnt get any respect until they actually won the division

which is how it should be so until the phils at least have a good year not just a good  weeks they wont get any respect either

btw atlantas 

ba is actually a compliment to how good the braves really are

their record is 

can you imagine the phils record if they were batting 

hahahaha

and atlantas hitting will improve dramatically

no im not a braves fan

just defending a good team

orin

bradley u

phils all the way in  braves hit like a aaa club reds need marge  bob  im really a jester in disguise

who thinks the astros are going places

theyre currently first place

theyre   on the road

 i agree lumberjack except that theyre in nd

they are going places  san diego los angeles san francisco cincinnati denver atlanta miami philadelphia new york montreal pittsburgh chicago st louisand points in between

  but theyre  at home

but they faced the phillies  a team that got off to an  start

 im just not used to an overly enthusiastic houston fan

i really shouldnt discourage it so hang in there lumberjack

but get ahold of that shift key will ya

 obbase apparently the new owner drayton mclain sp

doesnt particularly like excuses

an item in our paper the austin americanstatesman  if you read it here it was somewhere else first said that he wouldnt take injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been accounted for

uh oh

i dont want an owner thatll keep everybody on edge  id never gotten that feeling about him but who knows

does to be honest i think the city of houston loves the new owner

he has brought baseball back to houston with key acquisitions  players that were from the houston area and wanted to play for the astros

i dont think that too many people are fearful that mclane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he doesnt know a whole lot about baseball

mclane is a businessman and doesnt like excuses

he makes a valid point that injuries shouldnt be an excuse to this club

look at the depth of the bench this season canadele can play  positions bass and james are solid outfielders and can hit well too uribe is nice to have as well

the pitching staff has  legitimate starters

were dealing with a young houston team so injuries shouldnt play a big role

the only threat is the bullpen  if jonesy goes out we may be in trouble but with the type of starters we have this season there is less pressure on the pen

 joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball

  for anyone who didnt see sundays game   with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed  hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers

thats because lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games before that and was daytoday only available as a pinchrunner

  later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts  lankford a  hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis  alicea a  hitter with no power as a pinch hitter

what the hell  is he thinking

see above

  earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented  how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a  regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said  he liked gilkey coming off the bench

gilkey hit over  last year  what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every  team in the league

 at the beginning of the interview torre also said lankford is the one outfield guy whos in there no matter what

my guess is jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low on base percentage

whiten was a great acquisition decent offense and great defense in rightfield

but dont worry gilkey will be starting as soon as jordan or whiten displays an extended period of low offensive output

subject hal mcrae nohal mcrae is the worst manager in baseball

i havent seen enough royals games to judge his tactics so you may have a point here

but ive never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can

one of the best rawtalent staffs in the league and hes still finding a way to lose

imo the royals dont have a chance to win the pennant even if mcrae suddenly began channeling for john mcgraw

ok they have some decent pitchers

but when your offense consists of bums like gagne and lind and mcreynolds and mcrae and an overthehill brett youre not going to finish 

unless mcgraw brings christy mathewson back with him

id say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck

 yesterday april th a friend and i were discussing the theory put  forth by a local sports radio station personality that the  commissionerless baseball owners had snuck a live ball into this years  baseball games in an effort to increase home run numbers and attract  fans

its always possible but if this is the case i think that there is some blatant discrimination going on here

clearly selig is allowing the opposition to use pre baseballs against the dodgers

 well guess who stepped up to the plate for his first career grand slam  last night against the jays

none other than my boy

from nigumaugcsdalca gord niguma subject g williams sent down yanks win al east nntppostinghost ugcsdalca organization math stats  cs dalhousie university halifax ns canada distribution na lines  well it really isnt this cut and dry but as a jay fan the thing i feared worst has happened

the yanks sent down williams g and are going to start williams b in cf

i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation which is much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought theyd throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience

granted witt might be good but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience

the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards the jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff

the orioles should also be there in the end gord niguma to salvage the season let jj olerud win mvp

 dead wrong

last time i checked jim fregosi was still managing the phillies and doing quite a fine job thank youbest record in baseball at  look asshole i got him confused with somebody else

i didnt flame you and i would appreciate it if you extended me the same courtesy

no i dont know everything in the world

does that surprise you

valentine

 at age  alomar had a brilliant rookie year

true he was limited by injuries in his sophomore season but his numbers both that yaer and the year following were quite mediocre

this season the same bill james projects a ba of  ops of 

the same bill james

why do you say that

it sounds like youre suggesting bill james had something to do with overhyping the kid to death

au contraire he was fairly critical of him after his roy campaign noting that he wasnt allworld as a catcher or a hitter

he called him basically average when everyone else in the media was predicting the next johnny bench or roy campanella

both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball

the reports i read indicate that lopez is very ordinary defensively

which reports are those

the dodgers options are parrish and hernandez and now only carlos

piazza is 

as long as he continues with his very hot bat they will keep him in the lineup because they need the offensive production

when he cools off look for the much better defensive catcher hernandez only  to play more

i like hernandez a lot but if piazza can catch the ball youve gotta play him imho

hes a much better hitter although hernandez isnt a bad hitter

right now it sounds like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez will be candiottis caddy since he can catch the knuckler

as long as they play up to their abilities the dodgers could have a very good catching tandem

the braves options are berryhill and olson

i agree that olson is nothing special but i do think berryhill is better than many people on rsb believe

but both the braves catchers are very good defensively calling a game blocking the plate throwing and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively they play on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat

i think both are overrated defensively see nichols law of catcher defense but thats something thats difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine

about the only tangible thing we can look at is opponents sb and thats clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners

catchers era is a possibility but its subject to way too many biases

as for them playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat i disagree here too

about the only chink in the braves armor is that theyre weak offensively at several positions cf c b ss if belliard plays b unless bream and hunter form another superplatoon and very weak defensively if blauser plays

id like to see the braves give at least one of mel nieves javy lopez or chipper jones a shot but much like the talentrich jays of recent years theyll be conservative and stick with what they have

im not saying thats wrong just conservative

dave hung like a jim acker slider kirsch blue jays  do it again in  kirschstafftcumnedu new  quotes out of context

not to beat a dead horse but its been a couple o weeks  this disappoints mepunishmentsdischargesjackhammering  stephen lawrence

heres my analysis of jose canseco circa sep  and jose canseco circa june 

 

hes bulked up too much

period

he needs to lose about  pounds  not gain more bulk

ive been saying that for at least  years now and even the as conditioning guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his backalthough i dont for one second believe jose used steroidshis back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their framesee jeff bregel ex er as a textbook example and imho jose is too big for his frame



his bat speed has absolutely vanished

conservatively id say hes  lost  of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed

i cant imagine how to estimate bat speed but its pretty obvious that jose is missing fastballs he used to hit likely due to his back



that open stance is killing him

note that he acts sort of like  brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is  released

downing could do this without significant head movement   canseco cant

also note that canseco doesnt always close his  stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes  theyre fully closed

without a good starting point its hard  to make adjustments in your swing

i dont know he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the as and had no problems with it then

it might be that preback problems he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused but now hes lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him

the old saying if youre hot its a trigger mechanism if youre cold its a hitch

first minimize movement before the swing

close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing

hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely

the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance hes comfortable with for more than a few months

he changes his stance so much he loses track of where the strike zone is

in wednesdays night game he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me

i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because hes changed his stance so much

im also a bit concerned that because hes got palmer and gonzalez hitting all the homeruns hell become competitive swing even harder and screw himself up even worse

larussa always said that cansecos famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits

russ smith  i dont know anything about xs but i know about some o george gervin on being an assistant coach

 and now the not so pleasant surprises   tartabull

the book on tartabull was keep him healthy and  hell produce

well he hasnt done too much so far

sure

hes  hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasnt  gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed  to give you

then again he had a slow start last year once he  got off the dl that is and turned into a oneman wrecking crew see you in the series

 alan lets see april th less than  at bats and you claim that he hasnt done too much so far

cut this guy some slack

danny will produce this year

its scary to think just how much hell produce if he were to stay healthy all year

the yanks have a lot going for them this year good starting rotation good bullpen good defense and a good lineup

also i like buck showalter

frank howard on st is also a good move

everything sounds good so far

if the yanks stay healthy they have a good chance at winning the pennant

this is the most fun ive had watching the yanks since

from djcuxacsouiucedu doc  subject re evil smile on my face as cubs beat braves organization university of illinois at urbana lines  boy hats off to any cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put down braves fans

i mean all the braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series

also being the cubs fan that i am i really have to hand it to all the braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have

however i do have to protest anyone saying that all cubs fans are stupid

the way i see it either im just too stupid to acknowledge it or that observation was just plain wrong

you might have us confused with bear fans

 anyway about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the cubs would finish up last in their division

even behind florida

sheesh

these same people were predicting the braves to clean up in their respective division

well were ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now

i wonder why

well the way i see it the east is up for grabs and whoever wants it most is going to take it with the exception of florida

every team seems to have good batting and pitching with philly presently leading the pack

but i just have to point out if the cubs do take the east theyll do it without the benefit of a competent manager

however and it pains me to say it the pennant is going to go to the west

just had to get that off my chest

from tekqvirginiaedu todd karlin subject new uniforms organization university of virginia lines  usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season but the past few seasons have been incredible

any thoughts on the new old reds uniforms

i remember seeing a pete rose rookie card and unless i miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds

the mets how about docs performance today

have reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder and changed the mets insgnia on the front of the jersey

to my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since  and it reminds me a little of the dodger logo

many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform or at least uniforms that look more traditional

phillies reds expos white sox padres etc

and the once bright colors have been altered to gray

the trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years as opposed to the cookiecutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties

with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs no one in the comissioners office and interleague play on the horizon its nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be

every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being  offense  defense

a run scored is just as important as a run prevented

of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented

just as a penny saved is a penny earned

enough with the cliches

its not a cliche and unlike your comments below its not a tautology

it neednt have been true

if every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality ie

if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them simply because the ability to actively prevent runs would be much weaker

my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they wont need much offensive support

if thats your point you should have said so

what you in fact said was pitching and defense win championships and later pitching is the essence of baseball

neither of which says what you are now claiming was your point and neither of which is true

it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs

the team that scores the most runs wins

and you accuse sherri of mouthing cliches

this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs

a low scoring game would clearly benefit the braves

its not clear to me at all that this is true

in highscoring games the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time

in low scoring games the split is essentially  regardless of team ability

they should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting

on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers

i thought you said pitching and defense win championships and pitching is the essence of baseball

thanks for your help

hank greenberg would have to be the most famous because his jewish faith actually affected his play

missing late season or was it world series games because of yom kippur the other jewish hofer is rod carew who converted

did he ever really convert

he married a jewish woman but ive never heard him say he converted

elliot maddox on the other hand lowenstein is jewish as well as montanas only representative to the major leagues

undeserving cy young award winner steve stone is jewish

between stone koufax ken holtzman 

might have the wrong pitcher im thinking of the one who threw a nohitter in both the al and nl and big ed reulbach thats quite a starting rotation

moe berg can catch

harry steinfeldt the b in the tinkerseverschance infield

yep holtzman

saul rogovin won an era title in  or so before blowing out the arm

is stanky jewish

 third basemen    leius scott    





 looks good

too bad hes moving to short

 pagliarulo mike 







 this is an interesting line

his  figure was slightly below average

 his  was pathetic and his  was the next best year by anybody

part of  that may be his mobility

was with the yankees

was with the  padres who appear to have a rotten infield

was with the twins and  judging by leius and gaetti the metrodome may be a good place to play  third

gaetti gary 









apologies if i dont know what im talking about  but as a twins fan i like to think they have good players in any park

not sure if i remember completely or not but i think gaetti played with the twins in  for the world series and again in  note thats his lowest of the

he probably didnt even have as good a season as alomar last year

 guess which line is which  ba obp slg ab h b b hr bb x 





y 





 the walks should give it away

obps in general somewhat more valuable than slugging and alomars edge in obp was quite a bit larger than baergas edge in slugging

 im no sdcn but whats more valuable   hits w more doubles  more hrs or  more triples and  bbs

lets not forget the  extra sbs

how many cs

 of course the  hits and  homers are more valuable

 but dont forget the  outs

you cant have it both ways baergas higher raw numbers are due to him having more playing time and thus he had more hits and homers but dont forget the cost of those outs

 btw just to answer your question alomar had  sb and  cs baerga had  sb and  cs which gives a minute plus on alomars side

something else to consider alomars hr splits were  slg  obp

baergas was  and 

pretty clearly alomar got a huge boost from his home park

id say you could make a good for them being about equal right now

tp rated baerga higher actually

   what

  uh yes

baerga has a lot of flash but alomar was the better hitter  last year

  batters ba slg obp g ab r h tb b b hr rbi bb so sb cs e  baergac 





 alomarr 





 this is fascinating

you say that alomar was the better hitter last year and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that baerga had a better year

the only category that i see which shows an advantage for alomar is obp

the boston red sox lead the kc royals  after  innings

 the sox are the only undefeated team in the al east after  days

 go jump in the lake you nonbelievers

  steve  as i have read this net the last few days i am continually amazed at the pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals

especially when it comes down to saying that the bosox havent a prayer

as a long time red sox fan i will simply say the impossible dream year   for those of you with short memories

short lives or both

to be a red sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow the hot team

this statement is supported based on the increased number of brave woofers out on the net

a true fan of a team any team will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years and be amply rewarded when the time is right

yeah so what if buckner let a roller go through his legs in 

who cares if clemens told cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower

the fact is they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them

now that it appears that they are on lean times the number of detracters come from all over

so what

let them play and we will see what happens come september

the red sox may not be that good but they are certainly not that bad either and they do have a chance to win the world series after all remember the  mets

who would have given them a chance to even make it that far let alone beat baltimore

lets face it baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than football and basketball

because of this one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of  games

 this talk about the phillies winning the nl east is scary

very scary

dont get me wrong im a phillies fan but as late as last year they looked helpless

the funny thing was they did have a lot of injuries in  spring training that basically killed their chances

of course dont forget the dykstra wrist injury in the first or second game

 first game first at bat

 not clear to me at all

id certainly rather have a team who was winning   games than  games

in the  game luck is going to play a much  bigger role than in the  game

but you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to one run

not if youve scored four runs you dont

why strain even the best pitching staff

why not make it easier for them

in the  game the best pitching staff in the world cant compensate for a blown call a bad hop a gust of wind

winning close is the wrong way to win both keeping opposing runs down and scoring a lot yourself are insurance against the shit happens aspect of baseball

not every great teamhas even good pitching

but somehow rosemorganbench perezetc

you have a lot to learn

  learn what

i know that  million dollars is a lot of money

i know  rickey henderson doesnt have a career out of baseball

i know if he  didnt have baseball he wouldnt be making near the money he is now

 and michael jackson jack nicholson and bill cosby wouldnt be making near as much money if they werent entertainers

so whats your point

 i just dont understand how some athlete who only plays a sport for a  living for millions of dollars say he is not being paid enough

  if nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one hurting

 the as will still win without him

will they

you cant usually take away one of the teams best players and still expect them to win

or do you think the pirates will continue to win without barry bonds

  remeber many of these athletes have nothing if not for their athletic  ability

nothing

they are getting paid much more than most hard working  citizens and they are complaining of not enough pay

so

again jack nicholson gets paid much more than most hard working citizens and much more than rickey henderson for that matter

  i dont have a problem with them making millions

my problem is when the  say they arent being paid enough when they already get  millionalso  their numbers get worse

the reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks start making the real big salaries late in their career when they are on the decline

there are exceptions of course

dave parker fell apart after making his first million because he put most of that million up his nose

  actually i kind of liked the abott trade

we did trade the rookie of the year snow but with don mattingly at first for another  years why bother

id be willing to make two wagers  snow doesnt win roy

mattingly is out of baseball within five years

im skeptical of the first because i dont think snow is that good a player and he is on a losing team

im skeptical of the second because of his back

mattingly is  this year and how many players play until they are 

not too many and most of them didnt have chronic back problems when they were 

could be wrong on either or both but i think thats the smart way to bet

cheers valentine

 as for ryan is his wl better than morris

thats what a lot of voters tend to look at

and morris was awfully good for a decade and doesnt lead mlb history in walks allowed either

a replacement level second baseman could have had  hits  walks and a couple of xbh for the additional outs baerga had

a triple is little different than a home run

were talking exchanging almost  walks for six or seven home runs and four doubles

i would say the almost walks are more valuable

also alomar got a far greater boost from his home park than baerga did from his

and six or seven home runs

hmm

so if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in toronto youd take alomar

anywhere else and youd probably take baerga

from geneticpittedu david m tate subject re young catchers articleid

 blue

organization department of industrial engineering lines  mssnetcomcom mark singer said  we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball

yes

but this is irrelevant

youre talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on

i might as well say we know that very very few people are more than  feet tall so chances are that manute bol is really only  foot 

no

maybe i need to improve my writing skills

lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age  having not played at aaa level that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the braves lineup in 

why isnt lopez likely to hit that well

he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did

by a lot

as for rushing

if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i dont believe there is then wouldnt you rather waste lopezs year old good season than his year old very good season or his yearold excellent season

the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use

lopez was hitting 

over  ab when he was cut from spring training

what does he have to do to earn a chance

maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth

 gee

i dont know

abs sounds pretty good to me

about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a backup role rather than start every day at aaa

talk about me as a gm

the point was not that  ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up

ok

most players are not ready for the bigs at age  most players are never ready for the bigs

what does this have to do with javy lopez

most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa

see above

most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs

those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year

but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds

most players arent that good so they probably wont be that good this year either

now

the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners

and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble

not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans

not superstars not stars not even good players

maybe average if were being charitable

the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops

ummm

justice is a very fine hitter

pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell

gant is a big question mark

the breamhunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on whos in

blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop

the center field platoon will probably hit 

however good lopez bat might be given the above it wont be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability

wanna bet

the difference between lopezs bat and olsonberryhill could be  or  runs over the course of the season

given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play ill take the latter every time

the kid will improve playing at aaa just like keith mitchell did

i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out

my goodness

do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential

that was me and you so far your only counterproposal is that they really dont understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two

i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization

are they idiots who have built this ballclub

i doubt it

if destrade performs to the height of expectations then even otherwise edge to cubs second base sandberg vs barberieno contest

sandberg will be back may 

edge to cubsa big edge

shortstop vizcaino vs weissvizcaino is excellent defensively but is an automatic out at bat

weiss isnt much better with the stick

even

third base dave magadan vs buechellemagadan has a higher obp and is a better hitter

buechelle has more power and is better defensively i think edge to florida

catcher santiago vs wilkinswilkins is ok but santiago is better

edge to marlins left field conine vs maldonadowow

for  yesterdayi know conine has potential

i watched him play at omaha the last couple years

until he actually proves himself i give maldonado the edge however like at b this is position where florida might be even or better if the player there has a huge year

center scott pose vs wilsonmayedge to may even if wilson

hopefully the cubs will use may and save wilson for pinch running and the like

may isnt ken griffey jr but he will hit 

with  homers if he plays full time

right felix vs sosafelix jose has occasional power and a bad obp

so does sosa but sosa also has speed and a good glove

edge to cubs starters aquino

armstrong

hammond

a lot of fifth starters here

the cubs wont remind anyone of the brave staff but morgancastilloguzmanhibbard is average to okbetter than the marline

edge to cubs middle relief even

the cubs have some decent middlemen and so do the marlins

carpenter anf klink or decent but so are assenmacher and mcelroy

closer a healthy harvey is a big edge to the marlins

meyers is decent but no harvey

of course the cubs may have a few more games to save

look for  saves  blown from meyers and  saves  blown with a better era for harvey

edge florida

overall an edge to chicago

neither of these teams will threaten to win anything of course

  bob vesterman

  on what basis do you make this statement

  q sean are you serious

pitchers are pinchhit for in the nl

they are not in the nl

if a pitcher is cranking in the al he will stay in the game

if he is cranking in the nl he may not  especially if its a pitchers duel and his team needs an extra run

baltimore orioles  pitching but devareaux anderson and hoiles will drop 

cleveland indians  still dont seem to know what they are doing 

detroit tigers  all key players but fryman are another year past peak 

boston red sox  any team with clemens and viola might be beter than th al west  this division was the toughest for me to pick

whoever of the top  gets pitching should win it



minnesota twins  young pitchers seem to have best chance for success 

texas rangers  i dont know why i have them here

jose canseco



chicago white sox  frank thomas but no pitching



oakland as  larussa is the best manager and would keep any team close

chicago cubs  they dont know what theyre doing nl west  the  best teams in baseball are in this division



atlanta braves  awesome starters but offense could be a concern 

cincinnati reds  would not surprise me if they won it all 

houston astros  any team that signs uribe wont contend

closer to  than  

san diego padres  plantier could be the sheffield of  

los angeles dodgers  better pitching than the giants 

san francisco giants  because the rockies just stink

   the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to  death but i havent seen anything in rsb yet

  gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two  on and his club down by a run

he stroked a line drive into the  right field corner

the ball cleared the threefoot high fence and  went into the crowd

darryl racing over from right center got to  the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he  missed the ball

a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt  reached up and caught the ball

home run

  now ive seen the replay several times and i have concluded that  darryl missed the ball and that the fans glove was essentially  behind darryls

several dodger fans with seats in the immediate  vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with  strawberry

what cannot be disputed however is that the fan  who caught the ball never took his eye off it he was oblivious  to where the fielder was playing

he was also quite exuberant as  soon as he realized he had made the catch

  stuff about daryl and tommy and everyone blaming fan for the loss deleted i saw the replay several times too

no question about it

daryl missed the ball then the fan caught it

daryl is so tall that he had the first shot at the ball

daryls just whining again

i think it shows a lack of class when tommy daryl and the dodgers blame a single fan for losing the game

what about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball

what about the pitchers that gave up  runs up to that point

sorry tommy

if it were a  game and daryl was  feet  inches tall then maybe  just maybe  youd have an argument

i really hope baines can provide the rf support the os need

orsulak was decent but i had hoped that chito martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in 

the os right now dont have many lefthanded hitters

anderson proving last year was no fluke and cals return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant

the rotation should be sutcliffe mussina mcdonald rhodes 

olson is an interesting case

will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs

you never know

the way i see the al east this year with personal biases mixed in baltimore new york toronto milwaukee cleveland boston detroit the top  are the only true contenders in my mind

the braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description although right now id expect smoltz or glavine to take the mantle

what the braves lack however is an offensive stopper somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump

theres just no one there

first of all how could he start maldonado over may

after the way may played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the cactus league how could you let him sit the bench

not to mention that a right hander maddux started

i really blew my top when lefebvre pinch hit for rick wilkins with tommy shields

how can you do that just because of the leftyrighty thing too much is made of that

wilkins is twice the hitter that shields is

then the next batter was jose vizcaino one of the weakest hitters i have ever seen and who had looked terrible at bat all day and lefebre let him hit while may still sat the bench

i think even arnie harris was stunned by this because he showed may sitting in the dugout while vizcaino was batting

face it lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball

first is that the way the sun was shining in miami it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball

the second and most important was the fans

i like these guysgals

i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball

it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the miami dolphins

the way they were cheering i thought it was the afc playoffs

of course opening day may have a lot to do with it but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities

baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement

games ahead and lost it

i hope this season is much different

strictly from memory i think the phillies were something like ten games up with  to go lost  in a row and  of last  to lose to the cardinals

honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there

theyre both  shortstops that just hung around for a long time

big deal

are you for real

how many gold gloves does ozzie smith have

if a guy hung around and hit  homers a year for  years wouldnt he be a given for the hall

is defense not just as important

and if robin yount couldnt hit why would he have stuck around long enough to get  hits

are you saying  hits is a fluke

 hits is no big deal

 lets be a little more selective huh

stop handing out these honors so  liberally

save them for the guys who really deserve it

face it if something  isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore

when  certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential  candidates the absurdity is apparent

gee can these guys even compare to i agree garvey and morris dont deserve it

the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan

well based on your argument nolan ryan doesnt deserve the hall of fame

he is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time and could throw hard

very few  game winning seasons lots of losing seasons lots of walks

no cy young awards

how does nolan ryan compare to a guy like steve carlton who dominated  or  major league seasons won  divisons  world series and won half of his teams games in 

he doesnt compare

not even close

kirby puckett hasnt done it long enough for me

give me  more seasons like hes been having then ill think about it

in article netnewsupennedu sepinwalmailsasupennedu alan sepinwall writes   spike owen

sure hes hitting like crazy but the guy cannot  field to save his life

and they said he was brought in to  provide defense

velarde stankiewicz and even silvestri  are better defensively than owen

 remember  its still early

look for his offense to tail off and his defense to improve hopefully

he has that rep because i heard that either last year or over the last  years or something like that  he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops  behind cr

and tony im not gonna help this sorry mets team at all fernandez

i do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far

owen only has one error so far i believe

that seriously underrepresents the harm he has done in the field

owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches

he will have a fine fielding percentage like always

the problem is that he doesnt reach anything that isnt hit straight at him

this wouldnt be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to kelly gruber or robin ventura

but the third baseman for the yankees is wade boggs who should have moved across the diamond last year

ive only seen one game abbotts first start but there were three balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality defensive players

instead they were charged as hits against abbott

in article chhwvcvkaustinibmcom marcyogiaustinibmcom marc j stephenson writes keeping in line with the pessimists on the net ill hold off on the astros being all the way back

they could indeed contend but that would count on   atlanta encountering some unforeseen problems such as injuries or keeping  up their early season abysmal hitting

while atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation i feel that their relief staff may be suspect

they dont have a real closer  although mike stanton  saves has been used in that role

didnt stanton start off great last year and then falter

despite this your point is well taken

atlanta doesnt seem to have the same personality as a ny team thus is unlikely to selfdestruct

for houston to take em atlanta needs to suffer some injuries particularly to their starting rotation

  astros relief corps holding together

if doug jones keeps his changeup  effective and xavier hernandez can be effective then its passable

 theres no reasonable lefthanded help and the middle relief is iffy

 tom edens was expected to take over the joe boever setup man role but  hes been injured and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway

 houston thought that boever would demand too much money so they let him  go

doug jones can lose his touch  he went from clevelands allstar  closer to the minors in a pretty short span

from what i understand boever and murphy were considered expendable by the club

houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of players art doug jones is the key to houstons success

he must have another great year for houston to challenge in the nl west

lousey spring

 closer to the minors in a pretty short span

right

a strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling bullpen

 bit of shakiness at the fifth starter slot but thats basically normal

  taubensee anthony gonzalez and cedeno fulfilling some hitting potential

 anthony appears to be about there taubensees swing looks a lot better  this year solid knock against expos last night gonzalez is showing  some early power and cedeno still has the loopiest swing this side of  tim wallach

the unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the club so far

biggio and finley just arent doing their job of getting on base

instead of filling his role as an rbi man bagwell has had to assume biggio and finleys job

biggio concerns me since he usually starts the season very strong

on a side note are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning next years uniform

there is talk that their road uniform will be blech traditional grey with the word houston written across the chest

if im not mistaken their home uniforms may totally eliminate the color orange shiver mclanes favorite color is red so im really upset the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound horrible

id like to see the uniform of the mids return

they may not have been pretty but houston had established a long precident of wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball  and i liked it

end of the bargain remember two years ago

a little relief goes a long way then they could win  games

but i doubt it

ill project them at  wins

 its not an exception

good players come up young most players who come up young will be good

this has always been the rule

are most players who come up young always good when theyre young or later

worse its not a shift

this is the way it has always been

several detailed studies of this have been done and theyve all shown that players arent coming up any younger or older than in the past and they arent playing any more or less in the minors than they used to

the only thing that shifts is our memories of the good old days 

damn

i was afraid you would say that

 but all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current discussion which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who hasnt established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran

the padres played santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth playing

well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there

but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion

and i happen to agree

 both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball

 not by recsportbaseball consensus

that may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment but ive found that the sdcn consensus when one exists is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball people affiliated with mlb

i can believe that

im a newbie here so ill take your word

but alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above

that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long as they feel he can also hit a bit

lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded seasoning

 i dont know who knows

i suppose the same people or similar who know he will be better than some other catcher

these are of course just differing opinions

i read that his arm is not that strong i suppose somewhere there is some measurement of sb ratios and that he is still learning to call a game

that latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of his performance but it is a tangible skill

 i disagree in that i dont think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is

i dont deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really dont see any way that we could ever know who they are

nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously

sorry

new

dont know nichols law

dont believe in catchers era

but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers

any info on that

  absolutely

the evidence is piling up year after year

the only other alternative is that the braves really dont know that their young players are on average better than their current starters

im not ruling out that kind of gross incompetence but i think the salaryschedule explanation is more charitable

in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial

i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no

 consider we know that the braves are about the strongest team in baseball right now even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup

they have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has

it actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly lets go ahead and compete this year with what we have and then bring up the studs only as we have to so that well still have them under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions

 is it fair to the young players

no

does it make organizational sense

i think it does

well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions

i mean please dont tell me how to run my business

especially when im being successful

  c i could make it  or  wins if you let me bring up lopez

 s listen bobby

id like to

but the way i see it if he hits  the big club this year well be paying megaarbitration bucks  down the road in a couple of years and theres no way i want  to do that

 and continues with   we can win without him and then keep winning next year with him

 hows that

im sure you could be right

you could also be smoking some illegal substance

hey

thats a joke

dont get offended

please

 hey id love to be wrong about this

if you think its unlikely id love to know why

dont cite anybodys innate ethical rectitude though unless you know them personally

  well i cant cite anyones ethical rectitude because i dont know what it means

 but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it

baseball is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping lopez on the farm then thats what the braves should do

i happen to believe that its a baseball decision

while you from your armchair may disagee i dont

i think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made

i predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training

i think it is a very normal decision to have made

it is certainly more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers

sure it may be conservative

it may also be logical

i dont know what ethics have to do with it

seems like pretty good common sense to me

from ericsnetcomcom eric smith subject re the  phillies deja vu

keywords phillies organization netcom online communication services   guest lines  previously i wrote yeah the phillies played over their heads almost the whole year but it all caught up to them in one game streak

i am as old as  man

and i was a big phillies fan at the time age 

september  is still a painful thing to remember

but i can tell you that the phillies never led the league by  that year

going by memory alone i believe their biggest lead was   games and they were   ahead when the famous game losing streak began a streak during which it seemed that they found just about every way to lose known to man

anyway i think they rebounded just before the end and won their last couple games and were still in the thing until the final day but finished tied with the giants one game out

and didnt the dodgers or somebody else finish two games back

that has to be one of the closest last minute scrambles ever

ok you guys stirred up my childhood memories so i went and did some research on the final month or so of the  season

it turns out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate at least as far as the phillies record goes

on september   this was the top of the nl

what a finish

and the final standings were w l gb st louis    philadelphia    cincinnati    san francisco    now it doesnt appear to me that phillies pitchers bunning and short were really overused at least by the fourman rotation standard of the day until well along into the game losing streak at which time mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the phillies substantial lead had evaporated

the way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse although bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day  shutout of the reds that cost the reds a share of the pennant

bunning pitched a complete game sixhitter striking out five and walking one

it would be inetersting to see though how the total innings for the year for bunning and short stacks up against the rest of the league

also notice that the phillies played every day from at least september  through october  while they didnt play substantially more games than the other teams the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch

 news

organization biochemistry lines  nntppostinghost bruchnerbiochemdukeedu since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx

 posts going back to the braves could be better off if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame

back at the beginning of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily

olson was still recovering from his lateseason injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june

and then berryhill was dinged up

i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position

before last season he was the braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak was the braves offensive catcher prospect

besides olson and berryhill couldnt hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and dont walk enough to be useful

but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went with the two vets

i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he wouldnt have gotten his job back

there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around

after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear

there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind

certainly trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work

plus youd have to eat that salary which isnt huge but isnt tiddleywinks either i think olsons at about  berryhill at  but thats only what i recall

yes i think arbitrationeligibility may have a role to play in this also

what is it that  of the year players arent eligible for arbitration

only the  that were on the roster the longest are eligible

of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known

from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until junethe first time olsonberryhill go on the dl

i am still disappointed that lopez isnt on the team

i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that id rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez

of coursetoday we play the cubs

hopefully we wont need him

 as for the schuerholzcox conversation i imagine it went like this remember theyve both been gms the following is not meant to be read by the humorimpaired cox ok weve sent jones down

his fielding could be a little smoother

besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be

schuerholz well well have to send nieves down too

deion just wont sign that baseball only contract

we cant count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense

besides gormans not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet

once hatchers gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez

that ought to give us some pitching depth in 

cox yep thatll be nice

too bad deion wont sign

ok ill look for nieves when justice starts having berryberryer back problems again

now what about klesko

schuerholz well weve still got to fork out another 

mil for bream

if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera

i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he doesnt seem to be the same gm

first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark

if he gets rid of brian jordan then id have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings

cox ok keep trying on bream and ill wait til the trading deadline for my hunterklesko platoon

maybe i can get a few extra atbats for cabrera while we wait

try california if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid

and if that doesnt work then perhaps sids knees could be persuaded to act up

theres always the day dl

mwahahahaha

schuerholz what about caraballo

cox well hes not that much better than lemke

maybe if he starts in richmond hell start walking more

besides if hes going to be arbitrationeligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks

schuerholz now lets see

that leaves lopez

cox nooooo

i gotta keep lopez

sure i didnt think olson would recover this quickly

maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again

schuerholz nope lopez has gotta go

you know that hell get  million in arbitration

may as well put it off that one extra year

besides until olsons shown his stuff a little bit i cant trade him

besides berryhills a lefthanded hitter

you know how rare that is

cox dont you mean a lefthanded whiffer

pretty common if you ask me

i mean he made pat borders look good in the world series

pat borders

schuerholz hey youre the one who wouldnt write lopez into the lineup

cox well youre the one who went out and got me jeff reardon

besides i thought lopez wouldnt be used to our pitching staffs stuff

he got some time with them this springlooked pretty good

come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate

schuerholz yeah but which stiff

whichever one we keep will be hurt by may

cox ok ok you made your point

keep them both

surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest

then i can call up lopez and then we can win  games

after watching giants hitters struggle last year barrys swing was very impressive  hes very quick and his swing seems effortless even compared to clark particularly clark as of late

it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well

im not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits b b hr for  rbis

the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds

there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better

also the mets my other least favorite team loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight

big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs

hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training the runners lob will be lower this year probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and lankford and zeiles off year

i dont know why all the fuss about the fillies

the media and all the filly fans on rsb forget who is right behind them in the standings

give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games and well see who is in first then

i believe the cardinal pitching staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the difference

on a side note a few years ago  a comment was made by some baseball player or manager about the dodger defense

he was asked where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied fair

i remember it being in the they said it section of sports illustrated

i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in

go redbirds

gary wieman

i say buy out hendersons contract and let him go bag groceries

next season youll be able to sign him for nothing

that goes for any bitching ball player

stay in school

you have a lot to learn

 hi baseball fans

so what do you say

dont you think he deserves it

i mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance

or darrell evans

yeah yeah

after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon

um what

eddie murray was a superb first baseman for a long time

winfield as produced consistently for almsot  years and excellently on several occasions

dave kingmans best year was like darryl strawberrys typical year with the mets

darrell evans too did a whole lot more than just hit homers which is all that kong did

 well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal

whom are you talking about

yes eddie murray is marginal but thats because hes  years old

he wasnt marginal for a long time

honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there

theyre both shortstops that just hung around for a long time

big deal

not

smith has hung around for a long time and fielded the position better than anyone else ever has

yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago in case you hadnt noticed

one of his two mvp awards was as a centerfielder

 lets be a little more selective huh

stop handing out these honors so liberally

save them for the guys who really deserve it

face it if like whom

there are many players in the hall who arent anywhere near as goos as the guys youre running down

something isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore

when thats already the case by some standards

but the bad players in the hall are all from the s and s recent picks have generally been excellent

certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent

gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan

no but who cares

was stan musial anywhere near as good as babe ruth

not really

but he obviously belongs there

the hall has generally had about the top  of major leaguers

as more players come through the game more will be in that top 

and yes its pretty easy to argue that smith

yount evans winfield etc

are in the top 

dave kingman on the other hand was a liability throughout most of his career

of course garvey hasnt gotten a lot of hof press so i dont know what you mean

as for ryan is his wl better than morris

thats what a lot of voters tend to look at

and morris was awfully good for a decade and doesnt lead mlb history in walks allowed either

roger

 well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there

but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion

catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base

they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a wellaboveaverage offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they want to play olson and berryhill instead

i disagree in that i dont think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is

i dont deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really dont see any way that we could ever know who they are

nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously

 sorry

new

dont know nichols law

a catchers defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his recent offensive level of performance

thus mickey tettleton goes in the media from being a nohit defensive whiz to a slugging thumbfinger in two short years

the rule doesnt apply to perceived superstars who get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead

greg olson is probably considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he cant hit

dont believe in catchers era

but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers

arent they the same thing

in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial

either that or just stupidity

i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no

of course

is it fair to the young players

no

does it make organizational sense

one could make the same sort of argument in other cases

 usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season but the past few seasons have been incredible

 any thoughts on the new old reds uniforms

i remember seeing a pete rose rookie card and unless i miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds

 the mets how about docs performance today

have reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder and changed the mets insgnia on the front of the jersey

to my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since  and it reminds me a little of the dodger logo

as far as i know toronto pittsburgh and new york nl change their uniforms every year

every other year eg new york it will say mets in cursive new york in cursive or new york in all caps

minor changes but they do change them often

last year i think they had new york in all caps

did toronto have blue jays or toronto last year

what about pittsburgh

 many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform or at least uniforms that look more traditional

phillies reds expos white sox padres etc

and the once bright colors have been altered to gray

the trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years as opposed to the cookiecutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties

i hate the gray

they should opt for more color like the white sox

i hate white team versus gray team

spring training uniforms look much better

 with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs no one in the comissioners office and interleague play on the horizon its nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be

john greenleaf whittier

  hi baseball fans

so what do you say

dont you think he deserves it

 i   mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it  as   is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance

or darrell   evans

yeah yeah

after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in  eddie   murray and jeff reardon

i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points

however i think you approached this the wrong way

i believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does

i feel they were all much better players

i am not saying i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more

imho dave kingman  definately not

they guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag

the rest of his career i do not think he was very feared by pitchers

i also do not think he did a lot for the game

i mean really i am a met fan  he was a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame

dave winfield  i think so

he is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion  without stats better than kingmans probably by quite a bit

i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader

i think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society

examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done i know some of this from when he was with the yankees

i think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration

lee smith  maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of kingman

darrell evans  no

eddie murray  maybe he has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role model

are the stats good enough

i am not sure  but i would once again believe they are much better than kingmans both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as winfields

just think eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years

jeff reardon  my guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers

off the top of my head i would take lee smith first

  well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody  giving   hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards  marginal

  honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there

theyre both   shortstops that just hung around for a long time

big deal

 well i strongly disagree here

both of these guys deserve it for sure

i talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season

robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively

the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop  he would have shattered aarons home run mark by now

how many of those great plays saved games

how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game

while i believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers

both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame

as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player

 lets be a little more selective huh

stop handing out these honors  so   liberally

save them for the guys who really deserve it

face it if  something   isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore

when   certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential   candidates the absurdity is apparent

gee can these guys even compare to   the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan

 steve garvey  i am not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him

jack morris  once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name

kirby puckett  probably

the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career

if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately

nolan ryan  is there really any doubt

i think i heard something about him having some  records maybe they were not all good  i dont know i did not hear any of them just the number

he has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model

i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top  but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments nohitters strikeouts respectable numbers  even with some weaker teams you can go on and on

i really hope he gets all the possible votes

so in summing up i have  groups those that belong those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying dont belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go

yes  winfield yount brettnot in your mail o smith puckett and ryan maybe  murray and l smith no  reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up  these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions

just wondering

the fan is an okay sports radio station but doesnt come close to the ultimate in sports radio  wip in philadelphia

the signal might not be as powerful but then again only stations in new york feel obligated to pollute everyone elses airwaves with a bunch of hoodlum mets fans complaining  hours a day

wip took two of your best sports jockeys too jody macdonald and steve fredericks

wip is rockin with sports talk from  am till midnight check it out anytime your within a few hours of philadelphia

if im not mistaken wip has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation

rob ps the only nice thing about the fan is that they talk sports all night

hopefully  will begin to do that somewhat soon

or second starter

it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs

the team that scores the most runs wins

this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs

a low scoring game would clearly benefit the braves

not clear to me at all

id certainly rather have a team who was winning  games than  games

in the  game luck is going to play a much bigger role than in the  game

ill post the answers if you email to me

or post youre answers but emailing them to me meaqns that i will post the final results

i have one particular horrid pitcher in mind

substituting irony for brains bruce klopfenstein said  dtatepittedu david m tate writes   of course they left rbis off were comparing alomar the individual with  baerga the individual so only individual stats count

 i forgot

most runs are scored by players stealing home so rbi dont count for anything

 uh right

you also forgot that you cant get an rbi barring a hr with nobody on base

what fraction of all runs come on solo hr

 most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good

i use the phrase happened to be advisedly

lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to turn it up a notch in clutchrbiwhatever situations and what theyve found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an ability to any measurable extent

there are no clutch hitters

people who tend to do things that would cause an rbi if there were somebody on base end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by being in position

 my mistake

 i agree

 me too rbi are a worthless stat

of course so is stolen bases because sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run

and of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases so batting average slugging and obp out too

hmmm i guess homers would not count then either

my point

rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is

and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters

maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are

i just know it

in article marsarahalbanyedu jsalbnyvmsbitnet writes personally i think that alomar is all hype

he is producing incredibly now but in the long run he will never put up the numbers that sandberg has

for this moment alomar may be the best but overall sandberg wins out by a long shot

when sandberg was alomars age he was putting up 

seasons with no power

alomars  oba is  points higher than sandbergs career high

alomars career high in doubles and triples is higher than sandbergs

sandberg is still better than alomar but only because alomar hasnt reached his full potential yet

alomars got a 

yearheadstart on sandberg he has  hits sandberg didnt have  hits until he was  and is likely to put up better career numbers than sandberg in everything except home runs

hell pass sandberg in stolen bases sometime in 

sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases

what competition did alomar have

sandberg came in a year after ripken and the same year as boggs gwynn and the other magicians

so less attention was given to sandberg

alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre

besides the numbers dont count

the rotation has changed due to a strange injury to scott erickson

he developed a twinge in the stomach area and has been taken out of the rotation

new rotation to the best of my minds knowledge is kevin tapani jim deshais pat mahomes willie banks

 add mike trombley in there somewhere since they need five people

mark guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty

as to ss and b short will be played by scott leius who played short for much of his career before the twins

at third mike pagliarulo and jeff reboulet will platoon

 pags and terry jorgenson will platoon at third with reboulet as the backup infielder

pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who lead the league in da in  muffing what should be routine grounders heck muffing a grounder i would probably have gotten to

jorgenson did nothing exceptional that i noticed

leius missed a ball i think gagne would have reached we will certainly miss gags glove this season

winfield has struggled during preseason

sunday against the colorado rockies he went  for  with  rbis and scored once

 he looked pretty good there

contrary to what the mediots have been saying he looked reasonable at first

he isnt mids hrbek but then neither is the pretty big guy himself any more note im used to seeing the twins b looking kinda big on the field but not that big

if he hits vaguely like last year hes a perfectly good first baseman

note much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings

winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that didnt show up he didnt have to pick any bad throws for example but ill take what i saw so far

 hey valentine i dont see boston with any world series rings on their fingers

yah

so

damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his future

he certainly didnt earn his last one

how many games did he blow in the world series

all of the ones he started

therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing

oh yes

definitely

therefore morris is better than clemens

dont give me that shit

if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall

give credit where credit is due

this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick

and dont tell me boston will win this year

they wont even be in the top  in the division more like th

im willing to bet they dont finish sixth

im also willing to bet they dont finish first

and if you give me  odds im willing to bet that they finish ahead of the blue jays

valentine

it sure does

and it all depends on the definition that you use for better

yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really happened

well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened

but thats ok i understand you have a hockey background

stats like plusminus make rbi look good

is it violas fault that boston had no offense

is it because of morris that the blue jays had such a strong offense

dont tell me that morris has this magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs

this is the perfect example of your problem

you are isolating violas contribution from the rest of the teams efforts

you can only do this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without viola

only then can you compare

but you cannot know how the team would have done without viola

your analysis is fallacious

ok how about a straigh answer then

heres a very simele question to which im sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to

please answer yes or no roger can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs

al only please

for anyone else following along it is a wellknown and demonstrable fact that a teams winloss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows

its not a definite hardandfast function but there is definitely a correlation

in fact as a rule of thumb if teams a and b both score x runs and team a allows y runs for every  runs fewer than y that team b allows it will win another game

so for instance if we look at the  toronto blue jays we find that they scored  runs and allowed  of which morris allowed 

all other things being equal if frank viola with his 

era had replaced jack morris for the 

innings morris threw plausible since viola threw  for boston the red jays would have allowed about  fewer runs or enough for  more wins

now that doesnt take into account that viola pitched half his innings in fenway which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than skydome

so um roger

unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis

clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would necessarily have put up a 

if he had been on the jay last year but that is not the claim

we look at what the actual performances were and evaluate violas as better than morris in the sense that had morris performed as viola did his team would have been better off

it takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out here in the real world guys

this is true but not so open that your brain falls out

to be accurate it is big bang ben macdonald

 soon after that gray and palmer sent word to ottawa that canada had  achieved absolute superiority over the united states in the field of  baseballistic research as she controlled both the ackercook  pitchalike contest and the binaca blast research institute

meanwhile i have to go  pick up that truckload of denis boucher cards i bought to fill in the  area behind our tool shed   jking realizing the taterific importance of this work john palmer and i concluded that we might be able to pool some resources

i have not yet gone through the archives that jonathan sent to me when i do i will send out an official introduction to the deep drive derby

they cause so many problems

just look at lisa olson

i just dont think women belong in a mans sport

before you smart guys flame me for this i know the given example was about football

who cares

 it still applies to other male sports

how can we have women umpires

jeez

look at pam postema

just because shes a woman everybody on the face of the earth thinks its great that shes getting an opportunity to ump

if you even watched the games and had an iq greater than that of roast beef youd see that she is not nearly as good as most aaa umpires

besides she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a foul tip off of wade boggs bat

or jose oquendos bat

either way there are too many complications

even if robinsons extra  putouts  assists and  dps are taken to mean he was responsible for  more outs in the field that doesnt make up for the extra  outs he made at the plate not to mention the fewer total bases

the difference of

difference is still considerable

usual disclaimers about tps fr apply but they really shouldnt be way off the mark in this comparison

at least its better than fielding percentage carney lansford has a 

 th best alltime but  fr dead last of all time

also since this total rating compares players to league average instead of replacement level robinson should be awarded an extra 

or so for playing  more games

he had a great career but i would prefer santos plus  years of a replacement level bman

but i would knock traynor off the list and replace him by stan hack

thats a similar story hacks far better hitting outweighs traynors superior fielding

graig nettles and buddy bell would also be better choices imho of course though some recent net discussion supports this point of view

replyto mebonarsnsncclsuedu organization lsu news nntppostinghostnntpd snsncclsuedu lines  mssnetcomcom mark singer said  most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs

those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year

now

the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners

this is the crux of the argument to me at least

both the sdcn and the nonsdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catchers defense is basically nonmeasurable at present

you can talk about how important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls in the dirt

but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catchers rank in defense

looking at lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher

as far as i can tell he doesnt have any particular problem in his mechanics such as sasser

he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time

i cant see how repetitions at aaa are any better then reps in the majors

all were left with is the calling the game aspect

olsen and berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff

but this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers

how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn the major league pitching staff

the only way any catcher is going to learn tom glavines pitches is to catch tom glavine

similarly i wouldnt be supprised if the pitchers claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen

but given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez

now since lopez cant learn how to handle the major league pitchers while hes in aaa and since he doesnt have any glaring problem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in aaa that he cant learn just as well while in the majors

subject re braves pitching updatedir  in article bluecispittedu travenpittedu neal traven writes one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around  and 

 id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe  or  even 

give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds  identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and  even if you dont let roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot  more than the oleruds by going firsttothird more often

no offense  gordon

i wouldnt give baserunning that much value

the above effect is clear but there are other effects as well

if olerud hits a double any runner on first will score if alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap the runner on first may need to hold at third

thus oleruds doubles have more advancement value than alomars

of course alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double

another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams

no team in the s ran much but some teams certainly had faster players than others

still the current runs created formulas work just as well in the s for all teams

bill james gives the  senators as an example

they used harmon killebrew regularly as a pinch runner and in  stole  bases with  times caught stealing

yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by runs created

so far simmons looks like a total idiot

 leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation

i cant understand his and managements fear of losing tom prince through waivers

even if they do whats the use

he is aright hander like slaught

not a very smart platoon

also i am blaming leyland in this case since he is hcurrently convinced that lavalliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffsslaught should have played in all  games he has a good average against right handed pitching

didnt leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself

any fool could tell them lavalliere wasnt very fit last year

sorry but this is the biggest load of bunk ive seen in a while

a the pirates have been trying to trade lavalliere for some time now

nobody was even vaguely interested

b several other teams had made it known that they would grab prince who was out of options

c lavallieres release had nothing to do with him being through

he was released because in the event of an injury to slaught lavalliere is no longer capable they believe of being the everyday catcher

since slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties the offense should actually improve with this move

in aprcscornelledu tedwardcscornelledu edward ted fischer writes in article aprnewshubarielyorkuca csarielyorkuca shawn luddington writes hey valentine i dont see boston with any world series rings on their fingers

yah

so

damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his future

he certainly didnt earn his last one

how many games did he blow in the world series

all of the ones he started

he certainly did earn it

he was a valuable member of the blue jay team

not particularly in the world series

during the season he was probably more valuable than say putting olerud out there to pitch but yeah he was valuable in getting them there

in the postseason he sucked dirty canal water through a straw

the jays won in spite of morris much more than because of him

therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing

oh yes

definitely

therefore morris is better than clemens

your definition of better refers to some measurement on a scale that has nothing to do with winning ws rings

umm roger

return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago where the poster valentine was replying to used  of ws rings as a measure of better

the concept is called context and you should really become familiar with it someday

the facts are that morris has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a ws winning club

clemens hasnt

unless this transaltes to clemens hasnt gone into lou gormans office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until hed been traded to the jays im at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it

you can go on about what clemens has done in the past and claim that he is better than morris if you want to

but the facts are that morris has shown us that he can win and clemens hasnt

what on earth does this mean

over their careers clemens has won  of the games hes started morris 

per year clemens has averaged nearly  wins morris just under 

would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning a game

if so then consider that clemens allows 

runs innings pitched

morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings

in fact jack morris has never in his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens career era

but i forget in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to buckner missing that grounder in  had morris been on the sox it would have been a routine groundout right

whether or not clemens is better by your standard of measurement is totally meaningless

the object of the game is not to compile high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important

the object of the game is to contribute to ws victories

but this has been patiently explained to you many many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it

speaking of stupid it has been patiently and notsopatiently explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race

your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask

dont give me that shit

if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall

give credit where credit is due

this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick

yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit tooforget about what didnt happen and open your eyes for once and look out there and see what is really happening

forget about how morris shouldnt have won  with an era over 

when morris pitched last year the jays won

stop crying about it and get on with life

no one is crying the jays won and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the al east

they performed well in two short series and won the world series and i congratulate them for it

as a red sox fan i hope they keep morris

i was happy when they picked up stewart and elated when they traded for darrin jackson

you see unless you believe in some mystical link between morris and the offense you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky

luck runs out just like it did in  when he pitched odd more innings than  gave up exactly one earned run more than in  and went 

seriously roger id really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the  morris and the  morris

which one was a better pitcher and why

did morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years

if so then why did he go  in  with minnesota with an era over half a run lower than

i have posted two new postings on the net since i discovered how to use it and both times i received redicule for predicting the red sox as high as third in the al east

id like to hear why it is people dont think the sox can be as high as third this year

here are some of my observations well had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of your predictions the responses would probably have been a bit more measured

be that as it may 

roger and frank are in vintage form and the sox are rresponding to them

clemens is always in this form and viola isnt really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected

how do you know that the sox are responding to them and not to al bumbry hobson or my most likely suspect new hitting coach mike easler

i certainly am more likely to give easler credit for mo vaughhns hot start than clemens or viola



greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries

this was the optimistic scenario but not unreasonably so

he hasnt shown much power yet though



dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him

how can you tell that dawson is providing the leadership

perhaps its calderon

perhaps its clemens and viola

maybe hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him

or maybe its all a myth

and dawson has been hitting reasonably well but not as well as greenwell vaughn cooper or fletcher



russell is finishing well

in three games

why dont we look at this one again in say july



fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter

a bit better than could reasonably have been expected

but dont forget that zupcic looked like wade boggs lite for about  abs last year

beware of small sample sizes

still if fletcher hits as well as he did last year hed be a great improvement over any sox leadoff hitter from last year

be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesnt have to make more than  ab or so in a year



cooper is hitting well i think hell be better then boggs in the field and just as good at the plate ummmsorry no

i can buy the in the field part and i think hell be better at the plate than the  boggs but in general cooper while hell be a pretty good hitter couldnt carry boggs jockstrap

with a little luck he could be the fourth or fifth best b in the al martinez boggs ventura and palmer will all be better

if the sox pitch like last year they have a better pitchiong staff now and hit like they are so far they coiuld run away with thee division

but since i think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge of running away with the division i think that they win be over 

and at least third if not second or first

see here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether



is plausible third is not unlikely but phrases like could run away with the division are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats

its not really clear that their staff is better than last year

if russell does well darwin doesnt go on the dl and hesketh doesnt pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation they could be better

on the other hand if hesketh pitches miserably and theyre too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up conroy or somebody fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue hes a lefty and russell explodes they could be pretty bad

why

 viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does  toronto have

well i agree that viola is a better signing

however why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters

i understand lefthanded spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters

i just dont understand why people insist on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect eg yankee stadium

most batters in mlb are righthanded so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters

i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to lhps than rhps

however this is probably only a factor in the postseason because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season

i think you just want the best starters you can get regardless of whether they are lefties or righties

lefthanded starters tend to have higher eras than righthanded starters precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of the platoon advantage

from drwldelmarvaevscvirginiaedu david robert walker subject re young catchers organization university of virginia lines  most of this discussion has been between mark singer and david tate with valentine weighing in on the same side as dave at various times

my opinion fwiw to all mark age doesnt matter ability does

i would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best

i dont care if he is  if he plays better than what i have i want him out there

sandy alomar had decent minor league numbers grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major league hitter which is good for a catcher ill admit

santiagos numbers would probably come out the same as sandys but i dont have the league data from the mids to check it out

that being said i agree with sending lopez to richmond at least to start the season

as the box below shows he has one minor league season in which he hit well

he has two in which he hit very very poorly

i want to see that the  lopez is real

olson and berryhill are not complete mediocrities for catchers especially nl catchers they are essentially average hitters with equivalent averages around 

if he had hit well at prior levels i would say he belongs on the braves but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was just as much a fluke as alomar in  or santiago in 

one year at any level at any age doesnt satisfy my standards of evidence

granted i thought his behavior with mccarver last year was completely bush

last year was the first time he ever got  ab in one place so his lines are hard to read

but he has a combined  ops in minor league play with his speed is more valuable than the ops alone indicates and at a still young age  had a monster year with an  ops

he has a total major and minor eqa of 

 above major league average and above average for cf which was about 

in the nl last year

he has shown at least the potential of going into the s which would make him one of the  best hitters in the league

he has two full seasons before reaching his prime season of 

he should be considered as a legitimate prospect and not as a simple sideshow attraction

  thanks for your time

  joseph hernandez mr hernandez  i apologize for the misunderstanding

i explained that i know that it is essential for some fans to get scores here for they cannot get them elsewhere

i have no problem with what you do posting scores after the games have been completed

however like i said earlier i dont think it is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games like some others have come to practice

davis and strawberry attributed their turn arounds to reggie smith the dodger batting coach who flew in from florida three days ago and gave them a pep talk and some instruction

davis was  yesterday and had a couple more hits today

strawberry had two hits yesterday and i believe he had two more today with two home runs

foolish me

and here i thought it had something to do with the fact that they were hitting against wakefield who had no kncukle to his ball that day and otto who has no stuff

i wonder if reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the lineup who also suddenly came alive those two games

youd have to have no sense of humor at all not to

my favorite stuff are the zero heros players who havent hit homers in a long time the lgtgah who is that named after i cant remember and the box score line of the week

incidentally i just found out that the column has been moved to sundays

i get my dad to send it to me up here in boston every week

 psgpittedu paul s galvanek writes  since i did so well last year heres another shot at picking the winners  and losers

ill skip the commentary on why i picked who to finish where  due to lack of time for flame wars      kansas city 

  i think kc has a much better shot at being in the top division than  the bottom

one wordcone should help things tremendously

i think  you are way off the mark here

another word offense makes them my pick for last too

well theres also my policy of never picking a buck rodgers team for last   florida 

  chicago 

  i dont know if an expansion team has ever finished not last but i think  this year might be a first if it hasnt ever happened

the cubs are worse the  angels were  game out of th

the athletics and expansion senators finished tied for last

the  colt s finshed th  ahead of the cubs the mets were last

the  royals finshed th  ahead of the white sox the pilots in last

the  mariners finished th  ahead of the athleticsin last

apparently being an expansion team with a poor as or chicago team around is a good thing  national league west    cincinnati    houston 

  atlanta 

 argh

here is where you are obviously dead wrong

not since the yankees of  the s and s has a team been so nicely setup as this yearsand years  to come braves

i dont think that the allstar team will be able to beat this may be an appropriate comparison

the  yankees finshed nd rd and nd finshing   and  games out of first

in  and  they also finished second  though they were only   and  games out

even great teams can lose  thats why they play the season

on the other hand im still picking the braves to go all the way john rickert rickertnextworkrosehulman predictions for  marlins  wins rockies  wins androckies fans will claim that the offense is adequate

stay in school

you have a lot to learn

learn what

i know that  million dollars is a lot of money

i know rickey henderson doesnt have a career out of baseball

i know if he didnt have baseball he wouldnt be making near the money he is now

i just dont understand how some athlete who only plays a sport for a living for millions of dollars say he is not being paid enough

if nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one hurting

the as will still win without him

remeber many of these athletes have nothing if not for their athletic ability

nothing

they are getting paid much more than most hard working citizens and they are complaining of not enough pay

i dont have a problem with them making millions

my problem is when the say they arent being paid enough when they already get  millionalso their numbers get worse

in article aprcscornelledu tedwardcscornelledu edward ted fischer writes im still catching up from spring break but bear with me in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball

we certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day but there is really no need to rush him especially since we have a mega million dollar staff that is probably well served by a batterymate who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling

lopez time will come

lets give him some time in aaa

javy lopez has proven over  ab in the minor leagues that he is ready to play in the majors

he is not being rushed

players who are clearly too good for aa and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them at aaa

no

maybe i need to improve my writing skills

lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age   unless lopez is me defensively im   and born to play second base  he belongs in the major leagues

training

what does he have to do to earn a chance

maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth

 gee

i dont know

abs sounds pretty good to me

about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a backup role rather than start every day at aaa

talk about me as a gm valentine isnt saying he should back up

hes saying he should be put in a position to win the job in the major leagues which imho he would if given the opportunity

val if im misinterpreting please let me know

so far you have come up with two arguments against lopez  he is very ordinary defensively

 he is young and most players suck when they are young

 the first is irrelevant

hes trying to make the majors with his bat

and the second involves seriously warped reasoning

 valentine ok

most players are not ready for the bigs at age  see current related posting on clayton one of my favorites

most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa

most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs

those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year

but the players who are ready are the best and  the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors

javy lopez is not a middle oftheroad prospect

hes the real thing

now

again the most important thing a player can do is hit

lopez does that miles better than olson or berryhill

if his defense is good enough for greenville or richmond its good enough for atlanta

if he really was awful defensively he would no longer be a catcher

see sprague ed

now

the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners

not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans

the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops

the center field platoon will probably hit 

however good lopez what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability

the kid will improve playing at aaa and he probably wont being a reserve with the big club

oh where to start ok first of all solid  good

i want good players

solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really arent very good at baseball

think of it as twg without the caps

its a losing strategy to say we have solid guys we dont need to improve

you used it four times in that paragraph btw

same for experienced

i might add though that greg olson and damon berryhill arent exactly carter and fisk

olson has played three years berryhill five although  and  were a wash

the only difference imho between olson and valle is the supporting cast

two big bats

hrm

i like justice but i find mr gants trend disturbing

call it one and a maybe

the braves platoon is ok but neither player has any value outside of the platoon

bream vs lh and hunter vs rh are awful

ill leave the thirdbase comment alone

pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already

if the cf platoon hits  ill retrace mr likhanis midnight run down forbes and i live in ny and la

got that mike

and doesnt cox call pitches anyway

goodness

do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential

why on earth do you people thinkthe braves made this decision

are they idiots who have built this ballclub

jeeeesh nope

theyre baseball management possible the most shortsighted collection of people in the nation

do you not believe this goes on mark

do you think frank thomas needed those three months in aaa in 

or cal eldred wasnt really better than ricky bones last year

in article clclcmurdochaccvirginiaedu david robert walker writes  in article bluecispittedu travenpittedu neal traven writes one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around  and 

 id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe  or  even 

give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds  identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and  even if you dont let roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot  more than the oleruds by going firsttothird more often

no offense  gordon

i wouldnt give baserunning that much value

i meant to comment on this at the time

theres just no way baserunning could be that important  if it was runs created wouldnt be nearly as accurate as it is

runs created is usually about  accurate on a team level and theres a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the remaining percent

im confused

how is it hal mcraes fault that he cant win with a team whose best offensive player is phil hiatt

from pcastermizaruscedu dodger subject re dodger question organization university of southern california los angeles ca lines  distribution usa nntppostinghost mizaruscedu the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more lefthanded pitching

so far no takers

personally i think harris is a defensive liability and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays or at least been among the leaders

sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day he can get the job done

if sharpy played just one base every day say third hed also improve defensively

wallach has helped tremendously on defense as has reed

the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff

both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays

martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years

astacio lasted  innings the other day under similar circumstances

the dodgers are turning double plays and keeping more balls in the infield than last year

and piazza has also been great on defense

he has thrown out  of  batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first

wallach clearly has contributed to the over all improvement on defense

but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs

but i dont think he is as bad as his current average

i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs

from mamatha devineni ratnam mrandrewcmuedu subject zane

rescue us from simmons

organization post office carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines  nntppostinghost andrewcmuedu so far simmons looks like a total idiot

zane smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the dl

i would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch at all

i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week

now ottos latest debacle has restored simmons reputation

now he looks like he is back in his  form when he had the als highest era among starters

four our sakenot teds sake i hope he pitches with a 

era for the rest of the season

yeah right

tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing

they are still doing decently

but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse

tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters

merced had a very good oba his rookie year

he showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year

walk well he seems to be on the losing end tonight

but i still think that walk desrved his contract

leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation

i cant understand his and managements fear of losing tom prince through waivers

even if they do whats the use

he is aright hander like slaught

not a very smart platoon

also i am blaming leyland in this case since he is hcurrently convinced that lavalliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffsslaught should have played in all  games he has a good average against right handed pitching

didnt leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself

any fool could tell them lavalliere wasnt very fit last year

dennis moeller is scary

candeleria well he is not going to have such a high era at the end of the season

maybe it will be in  range

but  million plus

come on

other than the customary home run giving stage patterson goes through for a few weeks patterson has served the pirates very well each year

so far he seems to have pitched well for the rangers

i think the pirates should have spent the money on patterson in stead

the rookie batters well young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact

other than that their excellent performance hasnt been too much of a surprise

i think we should thank doughty for that

rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke

slaught how come he wasnt given a contract extension last year

now his value has increased immensely

lonnie smith

well eric davis was signed for a comparable amount

lets see

eric can hit better

he can run better

he can field better

now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis

an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith

even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this yearhe wont be an asset

he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field

management big big zero

sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing

he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay

alex cole fiasco

the pirates infield and cf positions look good

the rf and lf would have looked good if we could have gotten cole to replace two of the four outfielders

eric davis van slyke and cole would have made a very respectable outfield

even without eric davis thye pirates would have a respectable outfield with cole svan slyke and mercedi think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting

simmons did have options for the outfield

ironically the biggest accomplishment of simmons tenure was getting alex cole really cheap

too bad

compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it

the pirates can rant and rave

they will not get those picks

as of now the issue is still being appealed

now if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots nothing else will

on a final note

tim wakefield wont be as awful as he was in his last  starts

but dont count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season

also if the pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season they will miss reduss clutch hitting and his speedhe has peaked in the second half of the last  seasons pravin ratnam

later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a  hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a  hitter with no power as a pinch hitter

what the hell is he thinking

didnt alicea get a hit though

 usenetpqfcaf organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost slcinscwruedu philadelphia at chicago teams tied for st after sunday dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series

one friday one saturday and a goodold sunday doubleheader

what could be better declared ernie banks

perhaps the fact that the cubs are challenging

its pitching its always been pitching that weve lacked announced ryne sandberg

if we can get by brewer then beat carlton alexander or bunning  preferrably  of the last three  well know we might be able to win

lord i hope we pull it off

the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled pete rose followed with a hit sending ashburn around second

kiki cuyler cut the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to ernie banks who threw to ron santo to get ashburn at third

rose went to second on the play

christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving pete rose to third

schmidt was walked  the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them

both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw  walks this year

chuck klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a gap in rightcenter

cool papa bells speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent schmidt from scoring

nellie fox was walked and bob boone grounded out to second ending the threat

teams are starting to realize that you dont have to pitch to schmidt or torrienti and that is lowering their run total

it puts a lot of pressure on klein and dick allen who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells rose at first and its a credit to the phillies that theyve been able to sustain their pace

the picthers have slumped at times

so came the analysis from frank chance

the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit thomas grounder moved him to second and  after sandberg made out  billy williams singled home a run

in the sixth ron santo launched a tworun homer to make it 

dick redding got in trouble in the eighth as schmidt singled and klein singled him to third

ed reulbach entered to face fox but dick allen popped out of the dugout to hit

allen doubled to right but luckily for the cubs williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense

he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third

lance parrish hitting for boone was walked and bruce sutter entered

larry bowa grounded into a  double play but ed delahanty walked as a pinchhitter

desiring a strikeout since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick trillo pinchrunning at third chance brought in lee smith who induced a popup to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning

the cubs took the win  moving a game behind the phillies

steve carlton was called upon to battle finger brown saturday

to get another righthander in the lineup ron santo moved to first and bill madlock played third

unfortunately brown allowed six doubles and the cub bullpen was worn down even more as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against lefty

madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving home four runs

gabby hartnett hit two home runs and cuyler added another and the score was  cubs after six innings

the phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the cubs grabbed  more runs to ice an  triumph

sundays twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one point including a rare outsidethepark home run in the second game off robin roberts

grover alexander of the phils took the first contest  but the cubs captured the second one  with waddell gaining the win

bruce sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the eighth

the cardinals stood half a game behind these coleaders and would conclude their series with the expos on monday

montreal at st louisaugust  way tie for st dennis martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus john tudor friday

the expos have a wide variety of hitters and  while they arent among the alltime greats they are getting the job done

after winning their first first two games they suddenly found themselves only   games out of first in this wacky season

martinez triumphed  on friday and williams outdueled dizzy dean  saturday

however the cardinals refused to give up winning  on sunday

the cards captured mondays game too as steve carlton outdueled steve rogers 

were really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed remarked lou brock

i dont see why we cant win this division

the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them

twothirds of the way through the season there is a way tie for first

new york at pittsburghaugust   straight  wins for bucs now  back  but in th

when your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a pitchers park like this spoke gil hodges before the series

keith hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra  wins

the pirates have made only  errors all season  ahead of the second place dodgers

error totals tend to be around  for the best defensive alltime teams

rube foster defeated sid fernandez  friday and candelaria outshone seaver  saturday in a game featuring some outstanding defense

when nolan ryan and two relivers hit the mets in another  win sunday the pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the 

mark

they had been unable to several times in the past month

bert blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game

both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs  a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a tworun blast by ralph kiner for the pirates

the mets darryl strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off jesse orosco working his second inning after mookie wilson pinchran for gary carter at second

with one out and a runner on first lee mazilli was sent in to pinchhit

the pirates countered with kent tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter

tekulve induced a groundout forcing strawberry at second

he slid hard into honus wagner preventing the pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon

tekulve allowed a hit but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right field line ending the inning

tug mcgraw relieved randy myers who entered to pitch the eighth and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep center running through the stop sign at third to score an insidethepark homer to win

the pirates had scored an improbable  straight  wins and had moved to within  games of first place with seven weeks to go

san francisco at boswauktaaugust  another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldnt tire

in fact reported manager john mcgraw once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming week we may shift to a man rotation again for a little while

juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday beating lew burdette and the braves 

willie mays had all four rbis on  hits

rick reuschel faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest

the braves park had been a homer haven but this took the cake as the giants won a seesaw affair 

willie mays had three homers willie mccovey eddie matthews and don baylor had two and hank aaron ernie lombardi biz mackey and mel ott had one each

the braves had collected  home runs going into sundays doubleheader putting them on a pace for  which would be  short of the national league record

they were still a tad behind the  yankees pace

they had allowed over  though

vida blue actually got the win after retiring  batters in the fifth

he allowed only a run in the sixth but faltered in the seventh

joe mcginnity earned the save

in the doubleheader the braves hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the braves won 

the giants took the second game however by a  score

the homer by aaron was a magical  by the braves however they fell to three game below  making a comeback extremely unlikely

san diego at cincinnatiaug

 randy jones faced ewell blackwell in the first of this game series and the padres felt rather good

with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game the trade looked even better

mcgriffs batting average was even rising

of course the bench was very poor and joe gordon was only adequate in the outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding up

jones pitched a good game friday and won 

mcgriff launched two home runs

mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray narleski saturday  was the final score

tom candiotti battled satchel paige to a  tie through eight innings before departing

the game was scoreless for  more innings until the thirteenth

paige had departed after  and john franco hurled a scoreless inning

tom browning was working his second scoreless inning when dave winfield doubled with one out and joe gordon was pitched around

thurm munson doubled both runners home and the padres gamed a  win

the threegame sweep had pulled the giants into a tie with the reds

though the reds denied it the highly emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them

brookangeles at houstonaugust  another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the astrodome

the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in the first game opposite don drysdale

normally drysdale remarked i would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them

i cant afford to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we cant afford to let the astros beat us

he then winked and said well maybe davis will get decked once

the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six 

is primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season

the hitting on this team is a little better but the power is all doubles and triples

still carl furillo is the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw two runners out trying for insidethepark homers

for those unaware of the nastness of the astros park they have a foot high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs

the foul poles are  feet from home plate but the alleys are  feet away with center field at  feet

its as if some threeyearold threw a tantrum and told his playmates if i cant hit home runs nobody will hit home runs remarked roy campanella

the dodgers stole five bases friday but the astros decided to revitalize the baltimore chopping that had failed  weeks before for tonight anyway davis jim wynn and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the manager

after poles and willie wells reached base via the baltimore chop drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch

he responded with a tworun double but wynn  playing first for davis  popped up and the astros didnt score any more in that inning

they did score  in the fourth to erase a  deficit and the astros wound up winning 

they threatened to do even better the next game as tommy john would be their opponent

walt alston met privately with the starters at  am before the game

i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop he explained

how can we do that pee wee reese wondered

theyre going to be beating the ball down so weve got to be ready to throw on the run

steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but i want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws

well go with a shallow infield almost the whole time

the plan almost worked

mike scott allowed only two runs through eight innings but the astros got three two of them scored when bill doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third

astros was the final with dave smith earning another save

the dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday as nolan ryan walked five three of whom scored in a  dodger win

fernando valenzuela lost the second game  to don sutton however as the dodgers thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough

were mostly a power team remarked ron cey

jackie and when he plays maury wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other plays can do it now and then

were sunk in a place like the astrodome

i guess thats why theyre so successful there

indeed it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome

in article aprcscornelledu tedwardcscornelledu edward ted fischer writes   we wont really be able to say anything for at least another couple of weeks

but so far it looks like a homerific season

might the umps be squeezing the strike zone

   watching the braves on tbs i would have said that the strike zone in the nl has expanded this season

specifically it appears that the strike zone has moved above the belt

yeah the announcers have commented on that also but it was also my perception

 however the strike zone hasnt climbed all the way up to the letters

its more like a little ways under the letters

 any other perceptions out there

judging by the way the reds pitchers have performed thus far it appears to me that the zone has been squeezed to the size of a grape

these numbers might lead one to believe that todays players are slightly overpaid

perfectly accurate salary year of salary and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate but i dont think im off by much

from kkeachpomonaclaremontedu subject three homer games and padres notes replyto kkeachpomonaclaremontedu organization pomona college lines  to all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career the answer is johnny mize in his career with the cards and the yanks

he hit three  times

i am almost sure about this

in case anyone is wondering the record for two homer games is held by babe ruth and is 

mizes record may not last for much longer because of juan gonzalez

he has at least three games with three and maybe 

i know that he had at least two last year and one as a rookie

i dont have any record books at college for me to check on though

please let me know okay if i am wrong

onto the padres

is there anyone out there who follows them

especially those with access to local news

i dont here anything in los angeles and i cant get mcpaper consistently around here

comment it looks as though san diego has gotten the better of the two deals that brought bell and plantier to the padres

it has also forced the team to use darrell shermann

of course plantier could get injured again or he could hit with the power of  but with a lower average

bell always could finish with 

and  hrsessentially jerald clarks numbers

leadoff comment craig shipley

i get on base  of the time if im lucky at leadoff

hell of the usual starters use gwynn

hes got  steals already

is shipley starting because of an injury to stillwell though

i havent seen stillwells name in any box scores

anyway unless you are going to use shermann at leadoff then use gwynn

he at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases

sheffield comment though the season is early and stats mean nothing

witness phillips batting  currently

but does sheffield have an injury or anythingelse wrong with him

i just dont hear anything

andy benes is he pitching like he did in the second half of 

or is this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then

has anyone seen him pitch the two good games

score for today sunday april  padres  st louis

 did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture  of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa  today

any reason given for this

yes and the answer is simple

to create a better feeling in the park the seats will be folded back for baseball games where you saw those words

  the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend

the  mets and  orioles are prime examples not the cubs

 sorry but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent over  games

 i would amend your definition to  underdog a team expected to lose but which wins thanks to underestimated  talent

 dave

 ok the mets and os are good examples but what about the  reds

do you really think that anyone expected them to sweep the as

i know people who didnt even think theyd win a game let alone win the series

we proved them wrong though didnt we

as for this year ignore their record now

i hope this season is much different

  not clear to me at all

id certainly rather have a team who was winning   games than  games

in the  game luck is going to play a much  bigger role than in the  game

 but you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to one run

it was meant entirely  as a compliment 

i do this as a service to the entire baseball world on usenet especially  for those in the east coast who cant get final scores for west coast games  in their newspapers or late tv newscasts

this is helpful to fans in other  countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week

also  many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only  available through bbss or some pay news services

i was not trying to criticize your service at all

in fact i was trying to encourage others to use it

i dont personally use it but im sure others do and that was my point in postingthere is no need for individuals to duplicate in an ad hoc fashion what you have already organized 

if you want to send updates and scores set up a private mailing list  and use that 

 remember i only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the  recsportbaseball newsgroup

other than that everything is done through  private email

currently there are  people on my mailing list that  branches off into other mailing lists available for many others

hes a little bit quiet at the plate but like franco gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level plane

the first time i watched julio franco i didnt think anyone could hit like that

now i marvel at how easy he makes it look every time he makes contact its solid

hes got good power to all fields and rarely is he caught not ready for a pitch

i wonder if phil plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to practice his swing while on the throne

 sure looks like it  how bout one to add to your list travis fryman

the guy plants his front foot and seems to swing across his body

he generates a lot of power but i keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot out of his hips

garys list of id give dave kirschs kidneys to have a swing like that

well theyre already spoken for by several people but  id add robbie alomars name to the list among others

i really like dean palmers swing for some twisted reason as well as pedro munozs swing

thats all for now

im looking at derrick mays tapes tonight along with troy neels

that guy is a serious ox

a thought about may it looks like theyve taught him to turn on the ball

imho hes going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling off the ball to the point that hes going to see lots of sinkerssliders low and away

comment by m flanagan   the pi club  creating the largest signatures for the past nine months  

 one of the chapters in palmer and thorns hidden game is titled pitching is  of baseball implying that fielding is 

how do they determine that

beats me  its been a long long time since i read it

this was my opinion the stupidest thing in the hidden game

the argument was  defense or runs allowed is  of the game

unearned runs amount to  of the runs allowed earned runs 

since unearned runs are the result of fielding not pitching and earned runs are the product of pitching not fielding fielding is  of defense and pitching is  of defense

caombining with  pitching is  of the game fielding 

pete is usually sharper than that

my own feel is that fielding is in the  of defense range call it  between fielding and pitching

one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around  and 

id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe  or even 

give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and even if you dont let roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot more than the oleruds by going firsttothird more often

 the only really valid retort to valentine is werent the red sox trying to get morris too

oh sure they said viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say

lou wanted morris all along

the idiot

giving the man  million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded uzi with the safety off

the only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away

 and dont tell me boston will win this year

they wont  even be in the top  in the division more like th

 if this is true it wont be for lack of contribution by viola so who cares

i dont see why people expect boston to finish sixth

the bottom four teams last year were essentially tied

boston in seventh place had  wins

the yankees and indians tied for fourth place had  wins

now i should think it is obvious that the red sox improved more than the indians or tigers

basically the red sox are stronger this year at b dh ss lf and rf

they have healthier starting pitchers so far at least and better relievers

i see no reason why they shouldnt win  games

meanwhile the indians are in shambles and the tigers still have no pitching

they will win some  blowouts but they will lose an awful lot of  games too

maybe the sox will play poorly win  games and finish fifth

but i think third or fourth place is more likely

cheers valentine

hey valentine i dont see boston with any world series rings on their fingers

damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his future

therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing

and dont tell me boston will win this year

they wont even be in the top  in the division more like th

yeah valentine how many rings does clemens have

nothin like good old fashioned canadian logic btw the only good thing i can say about the jays rotation this year is that it could have been worse

 spanky is too slow

if he were quicker he would still be here

but with slaught and tom prince they didnt want to lose prince in order to bring up that th pitcher

slaught is about as good as spanky and prince is coming along nicely

tom prince is a  year old nohit catcher

think of him as a young dann bilardello

i cant begin to fathom why the pirates have been so afraid of losing this guy whos been in aaa most of the last  seasons

the pirates released kirk gibson last year because prince was out of options then eventually sent prince down anyway and he cleared waivers without a peep

hes another year older and still cant hit why do they think he wouldnt clear waivers now

why would they care

out

qualifications  one of the worse finishes in last years prediction contest

al east   

baltimore orioles why the orioles

well i pondered long and hard and it all came down to this  the blue jays are going the wrong direction

cant bring myself to pick the yankees  milwaukee was a fluke  indians arent ready to contend  red sox were bad last year and didnt get any better  detroits pitching will be the new definition of replacement level but you dont really think the orioles will win do you

no

as a matter of fact i cant see any team in the american league winning either division on paper with the possible exception of the yankees who i hate

but some body has to win so i pick the orioles

you dont really think that brady anderson is going to repeat do you

no

im basing the orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from cal ripken and glenn davis

glenn davis

thats insane

yes

so without further ado strong points hoiles ripken some years olson getting rid of billy ripken

weak points segui may start

valenzuela the original something may be the fifth starter

oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup

does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping ripken

if you cant move ripken out of the  spot why not move the rest of the line up

would be a good sign glenn davis wins comeback player of the year

would be a bad sign in a tight pennant race team trades for pecota

obprediction the streak continues

harold reynolds leads the team in caught stealing



new york yankees

strong points abbot key perez

could have best pitching in american league

boggs should improve on hayes

weak points mattingly still considered best hitter

the steinbrenner factor

the yankees lost to the mets

can wholesale changes be far behind

never count on rookie pitchers ie

wickman  millitello to win a division

would be a good sign boggs hits over 

would be a bad sign howe gets arrested again

obprediction mattingly wont top a  ops



toronto blue jays strong points management willing to make big deals

management has eerie power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects

olerud

guzman

alomar

weak points the jackson for bell trade has shaken my faith in gillick

losing stewart may hurt rotation thats really a bad sign

no one in the outfield can get on base

pitching is thin behind guzman and ward

would be a good sign jack morris considered cy young contender in august would be a bad sign club makes no major deals in august

obprediction morris will post better era and whip totals than last year

and have a losing record



milwaukee brewers strong points pitching staff was exceptional  last year

weak points molitor gone

surhoff at third

why

eldred cant keep it up

would be a good sign listach and eldred play like last year

would be bad sign bones plays like last year

obprediction surhoff wont finish the year at third



cleveland indians strong points baerga belle nagy weak points pitching staff thin  losing olin really hurts

starts felix fermin

would be a good sign bieleckis era is consistent with his atlanta starts

would be a bad sign ted power  bullpen ace

obprediction alomar will be back on the dl by the allstar break



boston red sox strong points clemens viola clemens detroit clemens weak points most incompetent gm in baseball

key free agent signing  andre dawson

burks is gone  hatcher in center

would be a good sign rainouts in between clemens starts

would be a bad sign clemens on the dl obprediction russell will make sox fans forget reardon

interpret that how you will  

detroit tigers strong points tettleton phillips whitaker weak points if fielder keeps declining hell be a shortstop this year

worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced  but not necessarily better

this year could be very ugly

it seems pretty clear that denver will have a large effect on runs scored ill stick with my prediction from last year that itll be one of the top  in the nl this year and a fairly large effect on homeruns  though apparently not as large as atlanta wrigley cincinnati and san diego

subject re bo was a good player you shorts plus idiots  bo jackson    kcr         







  kcr         







  kcr         







  cws         







 maj         







 maj           this is what jackson looked like in  with everything converted  to a neutral park on the basis of run production

his equivalent  average started at 

in  was up to 

in  and  in 

so  let us say he had established in his last two seasons a 

level  of play

im not quite sure how these numbers are generated

it appears that in a neutral park bos hr and slugging tend to drop he actually loses two home runs

or do they

what is equivalent average

one thing when looking at bos stats is that you can see that kc took away some homers

normally you expect some wouldbe homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks or to be caught and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway

but bo despite his speed hit very few doubles and not that many triples

so i would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park

 that is good

very good in fact

but it probably doesnt make the top  ten in the league

the th best eqa in the al in  was dave  winfields 

 thomas was first at  first in the nl was bonds  an incroyable 

 tenth was bip roberts 

but 

is better  than any season in the past five years by joe carter it is about what  mattingly had in  

 what felix jose had the last two years  just ahead of time raines fiveyear average better than ryan  kleskos mles

felix jose has been a 

player in a fairly neutral park

i would offhand guess the  bo at around a 

player

maybe 



not even close

 he got more attention from the media than was warranted from his  baseball playing though his hype was a lot better than his hitting

 that is the basis for the netcomments about him being overrated

the  media would have you beleive he was a great hitter

i think he was a  good maybe very good hitter

he was imo something like the th best  hitter in the majors

id put him about there too

note i hadnt realized the media had hyped him so much

i thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player and only soso at baseball

he did only have one hr rbi season and kc wasnt winning

note  i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there is a mistake being made by the sdcns as they are known on this group with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton and perhaps others

we find that if you look at a large group of players their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well

their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction the lower the minor league the less good i imagine the more recent the player has left college ball etc

now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of error

sometimes a player with poor mles dave justice the  ventura becomes a star

some hitters develop shane mack brian downing some dont oddibe mcdowell mickey brantley

this error involves real things there are real reasons why oddibe didnt hit and shane did

it may who knows involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on

but still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty well

one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players

one thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing ball

their backgrounds are similar

what hasnt been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background

is there some reason to believe that a bo or a deion or a lofton or a tony gwynn  or an ainge or so on has such a different background that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly

it hasnt been established that you can use mles with twosport players

it hasnt been established that you cant but then statistics is after all an art

i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton

look at those goodbutnotgreat minor league numbers they say

well what happens if those numbers simply dont mean what they usually mean

it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than tuscon

it might mean that deion suddenly has a better halfyear in atlanta than greenville

then again it might not

ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year live up to those poor mles

but you guys dont know

whats worse you dont know that you dont

and you dont know that there are other players you wont know about  injuries and lifting and wheaties again

you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal

its not

its got some error

oh well

from zappalapolluxuscedu daniel zappala subject re darrrrrrrrryl organization university of southern california los angeles ca lines  distribution world nntppostinghost polluxuscedu mark singer brings up the strawberry incident where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it

 before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech  wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that  are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play

was the fan wrong

should he have  been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility  of interference

yes i think he should have done more to get out of the way

as much as fans want to catch a ball they really should be aware that winning the game is more important

as a dodger fan he has to be aware that this is the home stadium and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible

as soon as the ball was hit that far his first instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it not to try to catch it himself particularly when he is sitting that close

i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans where they are against visiting team home runs so much they actually throw them back on the field

now this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or not

sure he probably screwed up but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win

they dont have tony bruno working espn radio and al morganti doing friday night hockey because they suck

i live in richmond va but i visit phila often and on the way i get wtem washington and wip

i hear the fan at night wherever i go the signal used to be wnbc when they played golden oldies because you cant avoid it

of those three wip has the best hosts hands down

chuck cooperstein isnt a homer and neither is jody mac

wtem is too generic to be placed in the catergory

in fact if you have heard wtem and the fan you notice the theme music is identicalsame ownership

i think so

wip is totally original

their hosts actually have a personality this is a knock at tem the team not the fan because mike and the mad dog and sommers are good i mean comparing the morning guys in philadelphia to the ones in washington is a total joke

anyway i like the fan and wip but i think the edge goes to ip

when i get back from philly i go into withdraw cause richmond has nada except the national sports line and those guys are totally clueless i was really mad when wcau was cancelled because they had steve fredericks doing sports phone after the phillies games

wcau is another strong station now its an oldies station but they still have the phillies i started listening to the fan because i heard he went there

i finally heard him last summer and he wasnt the same guy

those ny fans got to him

i was glad to hear him back in philly when i went to see a few eagles games

i will admit i am die hard eagles fan and wip is basically an eagles station  days a year

but i bet you the phillies are in control right now

about the knock on g cobb i like him

he knows the eagles like a book

i remember the weekend before they went to play san fran when everyone thought the eagles would be blown away cobb said that the eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win

well they were inches shy of pulling the victory

well thats my 

 weird thing leading  going into the top of the ninth sparky  used his ace closer henneman

the tigers have  relievers  and at least  were restedavailable

does sparky trust  them that little 

i think he just wanted to get henneman some work because the tigers had days off both the day before and the day after

alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre

besides the numbers dont count

national league pitchers are much better pitchers

youre right thomas gonzalez sheffield and griffey dont even begin to compare with ripken boggs and gwynn so no wonder alomar gets so much attention

sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was terrible

so was his sophomore year

national league pitchers are much better pitchers

that certainly explains sheffields  hm

are you confusing have eras that are 

lower because they dont face dhs with much better

from bmclevelandfreenetedu richard l trionfo subject re wfan organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines  nntppostinghost helainscwruedu i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wipi go to school in philadelphia and i listen to both stations on a consistant basis

now that the fan has mike lupica on from  to noon they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show but he had bob costas and magic johnson on too

now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent morning show in my opinion i think imus is much better than bruno cataldi and morganti even though i would feel different if morganti had a better crew of people to work with

to me wip tries to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme

in terms of sports imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he interjects humor and politics into his show

am to  noon i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show but i think chuck has the advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round

lupica and the other hosts on fan get better interview guests but i heard the pd of wip say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story

i would consider this even because they are two different styles of host

noon to  pm at this point i would have to give a big advantage to jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks

i just think jm has the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the philadelphia fan base

this is most evident when the igglesphiladelphia spelling play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan

where else can you have people call up and predict a  score without the egging of the hostsrewip morning guys i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts

i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin

if you are in ny and you cant get wip jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes

pm to pm this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and russofatso and froot loops and i become the most divided in my loyalties

mike and the dog are very entertaining but they often go an hour or so without calls or even  to  minutes without talking about sports

matd do get great guests and that is the basis for their show so it is like the  to  debate

another plus is the appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning which are often hilarious

pm to  pm matd go up against fredericks and missanelli

i like mike missanelli but i just cant stomach steve fredericks

i know that sf came from philly originally but when he was at the fan he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly homer now

i dont listen to wip much after  pm unless there is a game on that night but you will see later for the reason

that is why i give the advantage to fan

pm to midnight sm are on wip until  and then it is the man who makes eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism g cobb

this man is so grating on my nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go nutsi know that is biased but listen to his show on fan there is usually a game on knicks rangers mets jets or st johns basketball

if the game is on the west coast then it is usually howie rose

of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip but wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season

if this is the sports station why did they lose the iggles to wysphome of howard stern in phil

during the summer it is all talk on wip

overall i would have to give the advantage to wfan with the exception of  to  and  to  where it is even and  to  where wip has the advantage

compiled from the last five defensive average reports here are the career das for the individual players in the reports

stats are courtesy of sherri nichols

players are listed in descending order

and some comments with some players deleted

third basemen  name       mitchell kevin 



yep that kevin mitchell

i never would have expected him in the  spot

gonzales rene 



its no accident that the first two names are  only

as with first and second base  was the year of the glove

average da was  points higher in both leagues than any other year

leius scott    





looks good

too bad hes moving to short

pendleton terry 











highest fiveyear regular though hes only had one year as good as kevin mitchell 

ventura robin   







wallach tim 











gruber kelly 











the other elite fielders in the league

pagliarulo mike 







this is an interesting line

his  figure was slightly below average

his  was pathetic and his  was the next best year by anybody

part of that may be his mobility

was with the yankees

was with the padres who appear to have a rotten infield

was with the twins and judging by leius and gaetti the metrodome may be a good place to play third

williams matt   







add another to the elite fielders list

caminiti ken  









sabo chris 











too fielders whose career average may overstate their value

i dont know what happened to caminiti  judging by the three previous years his low  may be a fluke

sabo is merely average however

his incredible  best year ever brings his average up a lot

buechele steve 











strange last two years

schmidt mike 



according to reputation one of the best fielders ever at third base

but at the end he was below average

average in  was  boggs wade 











boggs has been pretty good

i dont know what happened in  but every other year he has been above average usually by quite a bit

martinez egdar   







last year  a fluke or a portent

nl average 











seitzer kevin 









al average 











why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another but very different from year to year

any ideas

jacoby brook 









brook is declining

hansen dave     



magadan dave     



jefferies greg     



three firsttime regulars above average in 

im not sure why jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding

hes never had a good year but while at second he improved to become an average fielder and is an average fielder at third

zeile todd    





zeile on the other hand is a below average fielder

each year hes about  points below average

and its probably not just the park since terry pendleton had excellent das in the three years before this

baerga carlos    



moving back to second was a good idea

hayes chris  









so why is hayes supposed to be good defensively

hes had a grand total of one year above the league da and was pretty bad last year

johnson howard 









lansford carney 









howard johnson and carney lansford  separated at birth

to his credit hojo did have one above average year 

lansford couldnt even break the 

mark without the help of the year of the glove

hollins dave     



good hitter but his fielding needs work

sheffield gary   





not a good fielder

blauser jeff  



fryman travis    



both are better off at shortstop

gomez lee    





two consecutive horrible years for leo

camden yards doesnt seem to have helped his fielding any

palmer dean     



texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career da but the lowest da at third ever

congratulations dean

distribution na lines  something else to consider alomars hr splits were  slg  obp

baergas was  and 

pretty clearly alomar got a huge boost from his home park

not necessarily

it could mean that or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road see frank thomas homeroad splits in  for an example

i would guess that some of alomars split is due to the skydome but most of it is probably due just to coincidence

theres no way to be sure of course but the only hitters the skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters and alomar is not a home run hitter

id say you could make a good for them being about equal right now

tp rated baerga higher actually

only because of tps bogus fielding stats which rate alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league

on a career basis i think tps fielding stats may mean something but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this

alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is but he sure isnt the worst in baseball

offensively tp rate alomar much higher last year

regarding the a vs b argument ill just say theyre both very good players with different strengths and a bright future

greg

subject re eck vs rickey was re rickeys whining again ive read all of the followups to this but i thought id go back to the original article to make specific comments about the method   jaomegatestcom john oswalt said  he has obtained the play by play records in computer readable form for every major league baseball game for the past several years

he devised an algorithm which i call sumoversituations and wrote a computer program to calculate every major league players contribution using it

it works like this  look at every situation in every game in a baseball season

a situation is determined by inning score where the baserunners are and how many outs there are

for each situation count how many times the team eventually won the game that the situation occured in and divide by the number of times the situation came up to come up with a value for that situation

 this was first done by george lindsey in the late searly s and reported in   article an investigation of strategies in baseball  author george r lindsey  journal operations research  issue volume   julyaugust  pp

 later pete palmer did the same thing using simulated seasons to generate a larger set of data to avoid the kind of smallsample anomalies that other people have worried about

he reported this in thehiddengameofbaseball with john thorn

gary skoog modified the method a bit and did some work on what he called a value added measure based on these situational values

his were based directly on marginal runs though not on win probabilities

these results as applied to the 

season were reported in one of the bill james baseball abstract books 

help me out here somebody  for example a situation might be inning  score  runner on second and no outs

there were  regular season major league games last year

with the rockies and marlins there will be more this year

say this situation came up in  of those and the team ahead won  of them

then the value of this situation is   description of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat  plus any baserunning and creditdebit the player by that amount each time  he gets a plate appearance

 now for each player sum up all his atbat and baserunning values for the season to obtain an overall value for that player

obviously the sum of all players values for each game and for the season as a whole will be 

 thats only because you always credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher theres no validation involved

 ok theres a very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on youre adding probabilities and probabilities dont add

runs you can add the total team runs breaks down into how many runs joe contributed plus how many runs fred contributed etc

but probabilities dont work that way

if bob increases his teams chance of winning by  in each of  pas that does not mean that bob increased his teams chance of winning by 

in fact it doesnt mean anything because the units are screwy

i agree and disagree

john is saying that the batters efforts will result in  more wins then losses

while you are probably correct that  does not mean  more wins then losses it means something

i would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by  in each of  pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning by  in each of  pas

thus there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between johns statistic and winning games

thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is

consider an example bob hits a out solo hr in the bottom of the first about 

on your scale

he does the same thing again in the fourth with the score tied for another  and again in the seventh with the score tied for another  and finally in the ninth to win the game by a score of  for a value of  bob hit  solo hr in  plate appearances and was credited by your method with 

 

 

 

 

but what does that mean

was bob  responsible for the win

certainly not the defense is always  responsible if you include pitching in that and bob wasnt pitching

in fact bob was only  of the offense which is a lot but not even close to 

furthermore what about the other  team runs

say they all came on solo hr by fred then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game which are just as valuable as hr to take the lead see lindsey and fred will himself have accrued a good 

rating or so

so fred and bob combined have amassed  of a win in one game

theres clearly a problem here

the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has

first we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game

second remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning

that is a player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases

thus im not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to  in that game

sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one

also the pitchers bad performances giving up  runs may have given them a large negative percentage for that game

also any batter that pulled an  night would give large negatives

greg thinking about the right things but his intuition is off the mark

closers are enormously important

the total number of runs value is outweighed by when they come or are prevented from comming

the doubling which greg allows is not enough

 in another article i proposed a test of this

we can predict a teams wonlost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they score and allow without regard to when those runs score in the game

if late runs are really more important than early runs then looking only at late runs should lead to a better predictor right

no but really only because you have a smaller sample size

i would think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning

and realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation not a blow out

it is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning

look a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games

on the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win

the offence has many more outs to do something about

but i am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either

if i am down  runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth

heres another thought experiment apply this method to basketball

what you find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost exactly no value because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play

furthermore the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with no time on the clock gets a 

for the game while the star forward who scored  points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero

 does this make sense

no but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be  before the possesion in which the free throws were made

look if you are down  point with  seconds left there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball

and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc

caused a negative chance that the team would win

from reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda

at first look this statistic valadates clutchness

but it really does not

cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down

ive never seen convincing proof that this really happens

so if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to player performance

there is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness

certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example

we may find for instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by  on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 

i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses

how do we evaluate relief pitchers

say john and sam have the exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs ks bbs etc

both had exceptional numbers

john however only pitched in closer situations while sam was a mop up man

who was more valuble to their team

probably john

who was the better pitcher

they were probably about the same

it was six runs in the th for a  win monday and five in the th and six in the th for a  win yesterday

jamie navarro pitched seven strong innings but orosco austin manzanillo and lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday

hows this for numbers

maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and navarros era is 

the next lowest on the staff is wegman at  ouch

it doesnt look much better for the hitters

hamilton is batting  while thon is hitting 

and has seven rbi

the next highest is three

the next best hitter is jaha at 

and then vaughn who has the teams only hr at  another ouch

looking at the stats its not hard to see why the team is 

in fact  doesnt sound bad when youre averaging three runsgame and giving up game

still its early and things will undoubtedly get better

the offense should come around but the bullpen is a major worry

fetters plesac and austin gave the brewers great middle relief last year

lloyd maldanado manzanillo fetters austin and orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful

milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place

the starters will be okay the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around but the bullpen is a big question mark

he had a very good year at louisville before coming up to the majors

as i recall the hype on pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit decent fielding

when he got to the majors and didnt hit as well as expected not as much playing time he became exhibit  in nichols law of catcher defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher

its not clear he ever learned to hit

his four years with more than  ab born  july  year ab ba slg oba   























no power lessthanleagueaverage walks peak year when he turned  now declining

if ted is going to invoke pagnozzi as a model for prince given that prince has underperformed pagnozzi in the minors its not a rosy picture

btw im still unhappy with moving zeile who had the same reputation coming up in the cardinal organization as pagnozzi except that he was a much much better hitter to rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a wellabove average hitter as an average or below average fielding catcher

p bavasi on dal maxvills view that florida can win the nl east in

 are you for real

how many gold gloves does ozzie smith have

if a guy hung around and hit  homers a year for  years wouldnt he be a given for the hall

is defense not just as important

frankly no

offense and defense are equally important

but the pitcher is  of the defense

the primary role of every other player is on offense

even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game

they might not do much with their part of the offense but thats another issue

that being said i think both smith and yount deserve the hof

they hit pretty well in addition to their defense

in article cjkuosymanteccom cjkuosymanteccom jimmy kuo writes   gteprismgatechedu michael andre mule writes     what is the maximum runs allowed before a stopper can get credit for a   relief

ie

if a stopper comes in with a  run lead does he getcredit    with the save

  if you come in and pitch the last three inningsand your team was ahead   when you got out there and wins the game you get a save

  sorta correct

if you pitched at least  inningsentered with your team   in the lead was the pitcher when the game endedthe game was never tied   during your stint and your team won you get a save

 well the rulebook says that in the opinion of the scorer you must have  pitched effectively for your  innings  this save is not automatic  unlike the others

someone in sabr actually looked at these games a few years ago and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one of the games  even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly allowing  or  runs

do you mean just like reds fans

have you listened to wlw anytime they open up the lines for fans to call

talk about clueless idiots

the broadcasters are just as bad too

 jl the new york talk shows are just awful in this regard

people are constantly calling wfan and wabc with stuff like i was thinking why dont the yankees trade kaminicki and silvestri to seattle for ken griffey jr and randy johnson that would really help the team or do you think the yankees can get roger clemens

the show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys but its still annoying

the best one was at the end of one show a caller started out with i was thinking why dont the yankees trade for and then the host hung up on him

i cheered

in article aprvirginiaedu jjahvirginiaedu  writes does any one out there listen to wfan

for those of you who do not know what i am talking about it is an all sports radio staion in new york

on a clear night the signal reaches up and down the east coast

in particular i want to know how len berman and mike lupicas show is

i go to school in virginia so i cant listen when there are on during the day

just wondering

youre right about the signal being strong

i live in west philadelphia and i can get fan almost perfectly

its a sports fans dream especially if that person is from ny and wants to hear about his teams while hes away at school

as for lupica  berman its turned out to be lupica then berman

neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show so ed coleman and dave sims old fourhour slot was broken down into two seperate twohour show  lupica from  and berman from 

and they both happen to suck in comparison to eddie and dave

come back guys

 the fan is an okay sports radio station but doesnt come close to the ultimate in sports radio  wip in philadelphia

the signal might not be as powerful but then again only stations in new york feel obligated to pollute everyone elses airwaves with a bunch of hoodlum mets fans complaining  hours a day

wip took two of your best sports jockeys too jody macdonald and steve fredericks

wip is rockin with sports talk from  am till midnight check it out anytime your within a few hours of philadelphia

if im not mistaken wip has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation

 like i said i live in philly so i can hear fan andor wip whenever i want

but i cannot stand wip

and it isnt because i loathe the philly sports teams  the phillies are my favorite nl team yanks are favorite al and the eagles arent too bad either

there are two big problems total emphasis on the home teams especially the eagles

unlike the fan hosts who can at least answer a question about an outoftown team if a caller asks the wip hosts seem to have no clue about any team that doesnt play on broad street

also fans periodic sports updates every  minutes gives sports news and scores from around the country

its very rare to hear an outoftown score being reported on wip

the hosts

with the exception of jody macdonald who i miss from his days at fan none of the hosts really seems to have both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good onair presence

the worst is gary cobb who seems to have been hired solely on the basis that he used to play for the eagles

anyway thats my two cents on the whole fan vs wip battle

easy fun rewarding

 some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the  edition of the bronx bombers so far

 first the pleasant   spike owen

all through spring training this guy was  looking like the second coming of mike gallego but with  even worse hitting

now the guy is third in the major leagues  in ba and hes ranked pretty high in total hits and runs  scored

i know its still early in the season but he and  pat kelly more on him in a minute have provided a lot of  spark at the bottom of the order thats given the big guys  mattingly tartabull oneill plenty of rbi opportunities

 lets hope he keeps this up

  pat kelly

the guy is finally showing some of the ability  that led stick michael to label him a star for the s  i wouldnt go that far but kelly looks infinitely improved  at bat i guess the tips he took from boggs in spring training  really paid off

huh

and here i thought boggs would never  do anything to help anybody besides himself

and his glove  like always has been terrific he and mattingly comprise the  best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball imho

  paul oneill

we had to get rid of roberto kelly partly  because he was under too much pressure in ny to be the next  barry bonds he wont do that in cincy either and partly  because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up  in the second half of the year

i just felt that we couldve  gotten more for him than oneill

well so far oneill is  turning out just fine

he looks like he should be able to  duplicate if not surpass mel halls numbers from last year  and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around tartabull

 now if only buck would play him against lefties some more to  see what he can do

  wickman

a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack  morris  they never have impressive stats but they always  find some way to win although morris seems to be losing that  ability

i figured that wickman would be the least important  part of the steve sax trade best trade since we got that ruth  guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever

but i like what  ive seen so far

he doesnt pitch pretty but he gets the job done

  key

whats going on here

key was just supposed to provide  the rotation with some stability you know shore up the left  side provide experience get maybe  wins and here this guy  is dominating everybody he faces

who needs maddux or cone 

 ill take key any day

 and now the not so pleasant surprises   spike owen

sure hes hitting like crazy but the guy cannot  field to save his life

and they said he was brought in to  provide defense

velarde stankiewicz and even silvestri  are better defensively than owen

remember  its still early

look for his offense to tail off and his defense to improve hopefully

he has that rep because i heard that either last year or over the last  years or something like that  he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops  behind cr

and tony im not gonna help this sorry mets team at all fernandez

i do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far

  tartabull

the book on tartabull was keep him healthy and  hell produce

well he hasnt done too much so far

sure

hes  hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasnt  gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed  to give you

then again he had a slow start last year once he  got off the dl that is and turned into a oneman wrecking crew  late in the year so well see

  the bullpen

ugh

what happened

we were supposed to have  one of the most solid pens in the majors

meanwhile the pen  has already blown three saves maybe more  i havent checked

 the great howefarr leftyrighty tandem

farrs era is in the  s or s and howes isinfinite

i didnt think such  a thing was possible but it is

hopefully theyll get their  acts together or else bucks gonna burn out the starters  for fear that the bullpenll blow a lead

anyone else catch espns piece about prospects and the relationship between age career length mvps and hall of fame members

it was part of their preseason special

basically they looked at players that had amassed  plate appearances or abs by the time they were  and noticed some interesting things

for starters they found out such players comprised the majority of mvps in the history of the game

they also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame

the kicker though was that they actually did some numbercrunching and found that such players careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group

they also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals hrs etc of the other players

the first group outhit the second something like

 i believe we are down to two the day and the day

i dont remember a day but rather a day

anyways its gone now

the period length is a minimum not a maximum

you can keep a guy on the day for as long as you want if hes still certified as injured

the player must be periodically reevaluated to determine if hes still injured thus you cannot park a player on the dl who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers

if you get someone qualified for the day that reduces the frequency of reevaluations

there is no longer i believe any limit to the number of players you can place on the dl

when there was you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between the lists

obp in front of you im pretty sure that sandberg has done this at least once

i know someone will correct me if im wrong

rbis and runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics

you can talk about obp and slg all you want but the fact remains  the team that scores more runs wins the game

  right

so who cares which player gets credited as long as the team gets more runs

if a player helps the team get more r and rbi but doesnt score them all himself who cares

consider player a single

player b grounder to short reaches on the force at nd

player c double b to rd

player d sac fly

b gets a run d gets an rbi

are you sure they helped the team more than a and c

roger

actually im not sure that philly won but they were ahead  in the bottom of the eighth

i was going to post the box score but since cinci was playing so criminally bad the pub i was at had to turn the game off

 so heres whats up  cincinnati had seven hits all singles by the end of the eighth

this makes it six games with exactly one extra base hit

 cincinnati was  with runners in scoring position

now if a team is going to be completely without power they absolutely have to hit in clutch situations

 cincinnati starter tom browning pitched 

innings giving up  runs and  h its while striking out 

he was surely the loser tonight

reds starters while supposedly solid have won only one game this year

of course the reds have only won two  cleanup batter sabo went 

besides yesterdays homer hes sucked at the plate

 dibble may not actually return friday

this may not mean anything since cinci may not find themselves in a save situation for a while  speaking of which the reds have ha exactly one lead this week for oneand ahalf innings after chris dinger on tuesday

i was watching peter gammons on espn last night and hes got me a little confused

 while talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players theyll be facing mcgriff hitting  home runs sheffield getting  rbis and glavine winning  games

this was of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball has expanded early s late s late s  what really confused me though was the mention of al players who would do well next year

specifically roger clemens winning  games and the likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting  home runs

 my question is how in the hell will the rockiesmarlins help the al

the last time i looked there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues

did i miss something

 only if you persist in believing that peter gammons is more knowledgable about baseball than the average mailbox

okay im overstating

still the man actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the nl this year did not pitch in the majors last year

huh

imo this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the other expansion drafts had since the talent was diluted over both leagues

in gammons defense because the talent drain came from the al as well some increase will be seen

he also gets credit for mentioning that the  jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the  season

sorry you got that one wrong

i hate the jays and dont care one way or the other about the indians

but objectively alomar had the better offensive year last year so i have to pick him

you admit tp as a reliable objective source

then you will note that they rated alomar as the better offensive player chosing baerga over alomar only because of his defense

thats a joke

alomar might not be a goldglover but hes certainly no worse than baerga defensively

mssnetcomcom mark singer said  we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball

 yes

but this is irrelevant

youre talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on

do you really have that much information on him

really

why isnt lopez likely to hit that well

he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did

by a lot

i dont know

you tell me

what percentage of players reach or exceed their mles in their rookie season

were talking about  you know

 as for rushing

if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i dont believe there is then wouldnt you rather waste lopezs year old good season than his year old very good season or his yearold excellent season

the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use

if that were your purpose maybe

offerman spent  getting acclimated if you will

the dodgers as a team paid a big price that season

perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road

do you really think they would have done what they did if they were competing for a pennant

 lopez was hitting 

over  ab when he was cut from spring training

what does he have to do to earn a chance

maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth

 the point was not that  ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up

for a stathead im amazed that you put any credence in spring training

did you notice who he got those  

hits off of or are you going to tell me that it doesnt make a difference

the kid will improve playing at aaa  just like keith mitchell did

wait a minute

i missed something here

first forget keith mitchell

are you saying that a kid who moves from aa to aaa and then does not improve would have been better off making a direct leap to the majors

if a player does well at aa and then does not improve at aaa isnt that a sign that maybe he doesnt belong in the bigs

now keith mitchell

as i recall no stat books handy  surprise

he jumped from aa to atlanta in 

he did so well that he was returned to the minors where he didnt do very well at all

now his career is in jeopardy

so how does he fit in with your point

good mles in aa

moved him right to the big club

now hes one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball

duh

that was me and you so far your only counterproposal is that they really dont understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two

i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization

well ive cast my lot

certainly you may understand better how good lopez is

and i may overvalue experience

but neither one of us runs a baseball team

the beastmaster  mark singer mssnetcomcom

joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball

 for anyone who didnt see sundays game  with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers

 later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a  hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a  hitter with no power as a pinch hitter

what the hell is he thinking

 for your information lankford is injured i think it is his shoulder or rib cage so he could not use him as a pinch hitter

earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench

gilkey hit over  last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league

 i do believe that whiten was a very good aquisition for the cards

he does not have too much offensive capabilities but he is an awesome defensively

since when have the cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense

 i forgot who st louis gave up for him but it was not too much

as far as gilkey is concerned he is a leftfielder and so is brian jordan who beat him out

i expect to see a gilkeyjordan platoon in lf

furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home  i agree with you on this one

as soon as larkin threw that ball i knew that lankford was a dead bird

but how could dent have known that larkin would make a perfect throw

i strongly believe that torre is one of the best managers in baseball

dont forget the overachieving cards of  that won all those close games and went from last place to second place although they were oveshadowed by the braves twins last to first climb

he won a division title and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the braves why atlanta ever even considered firing him i will never understand

with torre at the controls the cardinals are heading in the right direction

one more thing one game does not make a season

yes they lost to the reds but with the second best pitching staff in the national league first in the east and a pretty good offense the redbirds will win a lot more than they lose

maybe this is the year that they will go all the way

rbis and runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics

actually theyre pretty worthless if you want to evaluate players with stats

rbis and runs scored should be banned all they do is confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself

you can talk about obp and slg all you want but the fact remains  the team that scores more runs wins the game

  uh so

youve just explained why we use obp and slg to evaluate players

precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game

traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored  thats where obp slg runs created linear weights etc

come in

these simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a players offensive contribution to the teams runs scored

thank you for making our case

while lopez might some  day be a better catcher than olson i find it totally amazing for  you to suggest that this  yearold with three seasons of professional  baseball is now better than olson a fiveyear mlb veteran who is  noted for his ability to call a game and who has a betterthanaverage  arm

oh perhaps you are talking about hitting

well sure lopez  might hit better

perhaps he probably will

  but has there ever in the history of baseball been a yearold or  younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league  catchers in terms of defense and brought a 

bat

wasnt it yes ivan rodriguez last year

batted 

and threw out  of the baserunners

not too shabby for a rookie from aa

years old last year

 sandy alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year

 not

wasnt it benito santiago who was supposed to be that good  in his rookie year

not

  i can continue this thread with the others mentioned but you get  the point

you and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the  seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies

perhaps   just perhaps  the management team of the pennantwinning braves  knows something more than you do

and perhaps what they know is  that very very few  and year old rookies come up to the majors  and make an impact

sure its been cold the food lines were long and the hired hands were surly but this was all part of the giants mystique

or so i thought

i went to tuesdays game    giants over the marlins and the stick was a much different place

nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind but everything is a lot better

the lines are a lot shorter the bathrooms are clean and have running water and the hired hands were very polite

the new foghorn lights up and blows after each homerun and the wooden fence are very nice as are the new bleachers

the bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view and theyve got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers

the only complaint is that the electronic oldfashioned scoreboard looks electronic  could be better

these things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real businessman ex  safeway president peter magowan to figure it out

just like he used to tell his checkers if the customers dont come back i dont need as many checkers

this isnt a knock on bob lurie  he was a competent businessman but he didnt deal much with the general public

ill give an example of how the level of service has changed

the onion dispenser jammed as i was using it

an attendant came over apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine

after he was done he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help

in the old days there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say go to the stand  feet away  they might be able to help

 mattingly is out of baseball within five years

 im skeptical of the first because i dont think snow is that good a player and he is on a losing team

i dont have a history handy but i dont recall that the preponderance of roys come from winning teams

in fact i think team performance is generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins

am i wrong

and he is not necessarily on a losing team

while the angels staff is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank you

snow is playing great

salmon is learning to make the adjustments

easley appears fine but even if hes not flora is ready to come up

between gonzales and gruber theyll manage the hot corner

polonia and curtis are steady and heady

even myers and orton are contributing

personally i think they can finish over 

which makes them a winning team

the beastmaster  im skeptical of the second because of his back

mattingly is  this year and how many players play until they are 

not too many and most of them didnt have chronic back problems when they were 

 could be wrong on either or both but i think thats the smart way to bet  cheers valentine  mark singer mssnetcomcom

there is a jayson stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate and also for baseball america

anyone who writes dean palmer has  homers  at this pace hell  have  home runs

should be shot

 if at the end of april he has  and anyone writes at this  pace hell have  homers

they shouldbe shot too

stark has done this sort of thing but he has never been serious about it

he usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of such columns

i think he did it one season and some manager was projected to be thrown out of  games and some hitter could expect to be plunked  times

stark does some really funny stuff

his weekly baseball reviews are good collections of strange things that happened during the previous week

he also regularly prints kinerisms

hank greenberg sid gordon ron blomberg

guess it goes from the sublime to the ridiculous

 every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball  being  offense  defense

a run scored is just as important as a run  prevented

   this certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any  statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what  percent is fielding

id really like to know

btw sherri thanks for  the da data i find it fascinating

one of the chapters in palmer and thorns hidden game is titled pitching is  of baseball implying that fielding is 

how do they determine that

beats me  its been a long long time since i read it

one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around  and

in article aprnewsyaleedu steve tomassi writes  hi baseball fans

so what do you say

dont you think he deserves it

i mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance

or darrell evans

yeah yeah

after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon

oh yeah

dave winfieldmarginal player

guy didnt hit a lick had negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power

dave winfield now entering his i believe th big league season is still a damn decent hitter

admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime he had a powerful arm and great range

take a look at the stats i dont know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman are similar players

kingman was a onedimension power hitterhe couldnt field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right his obp wasnt that hideous and for those who consider such things important was a absoluteprimodick

eddie murray

yup only the best st baseman of the s i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in  it seems that he wasnt overrated by the media

lee smith

hmmmm

this ones actually pretty close

hes had a s solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks wrigley fenway id have to take a closer look at the stats its been a while but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber

you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers simply racking up a lot of saves doesnt mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch too

simply because minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves

no way should homerman be in the hof imho

darrell evans

nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like ted simmons imho but not a hofer

 well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal

lemme ask you this

who the hell playing the game isnt marginal

honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there

theyre both shortstops that just hung around for a long time

big deal

lets be a little more selective huh

stop handing out these honors so liberally

save them for the guys who really deserve it

face it if something now wait a goddamn minute here

ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop

his defense was so good that hes won something along the lines of  gold gloves

again gold gloves are mediotbiased and a good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzies more recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early s getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career

ozzies offense you ask

good obp great speed numbers in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power cept against tom niedenfuer  but still a definite asset offensively

yount

 hits mvp at two different positions uhhuh a real stiff

his  was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks as far as ss numbers go

hes a clear hofer imho

isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore

when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent

gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan

well as far as garvey goes youre right

garvey is a mediot candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of a tree stump garvey shouldnt be in the hof

skyjack

ive said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris ability to win which is nothing more than morris ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs

at this point morris is an average pitcher although from his early returns in  he may be damned close to done

but in all fairness morris was a dominant pitcher in the s for upanddown tiger teams

while  was obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but not favorites

morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of hof consideration

ryan

of course but be careful

i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who hung around a long time

after all nolan never won a cy

damn hes just pitcher who hung around for  years his wl record is mediocre of course nolans a hofer puck

probably although hes got to play reasonably well for a few more years  years even good ones arent enough to make the hof most likely

that said i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something really tragic or sudden

hes very popular in the media and with fans and legitimately has been one of the best cfs in the game since he joined the league

ive always liked the guy and i hope he does make it

and in the end i think the puck will make it in

but really its too early to sell

this debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not i never tire of it

its an interesting subject

heres an off the top of my head list of potential hofers from each team

i probably left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow up

i wont consider anyone who started playing after about  again too early to tell

note these are all active players im not counting recent retirees baltimore cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrigs record stands boston roger clemens might be a lock already which is amazing dawson 

detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker possibilities milwaukee robin yount discussed earlier new york wade boggs possibly mattingly long shot toronto paul molitor and jack morris possibilities kansas city george brett lock minnesota kirby too early to tell winfield lock oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shot texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange  cubs sandberg lock st louis ozzie lock lee smith probably new york murray almost a lock saberhagen obviously hes got to regain past form and most certainly not vince coleman despite what hell tell you  los angeles butler strawberry and hershiser are all long shots

san diego tony gwynn pretty good shot colorado dale murphy a good shot ryan bowen just to see if youre awake before i get flames this is an offthetopofthehead list theres probably a few deserving candidates that i left off and i didnt include barry bonds will clark any atlanta starting pitcher frank thomas canseco mcgriff etc

because i only considered guys who started playing before  email or post i almost fear what i may have started here  bruce hasch haschjhuvmshcfjhuedu sell the team eli

if a hitter is a good fastball hitter does that mean i should throw him a bad fastball

larry andersen

 of course they left rbis off were comparing alomar the individual with  baerga the individual so only individual stats count

i forgot

most runs are scored by players stealing home so rbi dont count for anything

uh right

you also forgot that you cant get an rbi barring a hr with nobody on base

what fraction of all runs come on solo hr

most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good

i use the phrase happened to be advisedly

lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to turn it up a notch in clutchrbiwhatever situations and what theyve found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an ability to any measurable extent

there are no clutch hitters

people who tend to do things that would cause an rbi if there were somebody on base end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by being in position

my mistake

i agree

i would immediately give mcmchael many chances to pitch after spring and then use bedrock and freeman after that

i am wondering how he intends to use howell

whatever happened to senior smoke

do you mean juan berenguer

he was traded for mark davis in the middle of last season

exchanged one stiff for another as berenguer hadnt come back from his injury in

how good does their rotation look

the last i heard the order is tapani erikson mahomes banks and some guy ive never heard of

sounds pretty pathetic to me well maybe it will be

banks is a  yearold prospect who hasnt matured as quickly as they would have liked

mahomes is a  yearold who is very highly touted

tapani and erickson are also young and have looked very good this spring

the last spot was between jim deshaies formerly of houston and sd

and mike trombley

deshaies hasnt looked very good this spring so i believe that the spot has gone to trombley although they hadnt wanted  starters this unproven

i personally believe very highly in mahomes and trombley

 

who is playing short and third

well scott leius is the shortstop

he played mostly b last year but was a ss in the minors and moved back after gagne left to kc

b is split maybe between pagliarulo who has had a great spring and terry jorgenson a good looking kid who has languished in portland for  years

im not sure how the time will be divided but they seem to be happy with what they have here

i like jorgenson but i fear they might give too much time to pags

i just love how the alomar fans left rbis off this list

give me a break

alomar fans left rbi fans and runs off this list because they are dependant on the team

to a large extent

if frank thomas hit first hed lose a lot of rbis and anyways how many nd place hitters have you known to drive in  runs

doesnt happen that oftenvery unlikely with devon whites 

obp in front of you gord niguma fav player john olerud

i was watching peter gammons on espn last night and hes got me a little confused

 while talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players theyll be facing mcgriff hitting  home runs sheffield getting  rbis and glavine winning  games

this was of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball has expanded early s late s late s  what really confused me though was the mention of al players who would do well next year

specifically roger clemens winning  games and the likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting  home runs

 my question is how in the hell will the rockiesmarlins help the al

the last time i looked there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues

did i miss something

 dennis cleary dfclearyucdavisedu  i wondered the same thing

when he first mentioned it i thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over

and then in the examples from other years he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded

so since stats never lie   i guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that normally they would not have had there not been expansion

make sense

the ackman and nine of his relatives are currently impersonating the baltimore orioles pitching staff

no no no

the ack man is apparently an alien lifeform much like the pod people from planet mars who can take on any form the ability remains the same however

the ackpeople have been spotted on many teams to date but it appears that the orioles staff mentioned above and the expos bullpen barnes walton fassero gardiner and rojas have been the prime target

apparently john wetteland was roughed up by the ackpeople during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover and has been on the dl ever since

i read this morning that sid fernandez left last nights game with stiffness in his shoulder

does anyone have any information as to the extent of the injury if indeed there is one or weather the cold air in colorado just got his joints a little stiff

 thanks for the help all they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder after throwing a curveball that didnt loosen

because of the cold night in denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than let him pitch

he is expected to pitch his next turn in the rotation expected to be april  at shea vs the giants

from aardvarkcygnuslalocuscom warren usui subject recsportbaseballfantasy organization locus computing corporation los angeles california lines  april   i am participating in an nlleague that uses standard rotisserie rules except that the following catagories are used for position players lowest batting average strikeouts caughtstealing errors for pitchers losses blown saves higest era taters allowed this is the fifth year that ive participated in this blowtisserie league

last year i won the pennant due primarily to the fact that i had terrible pitching

i would like to lower my batting average which is rather high because i do have jose offerman who made up for this by helping me lock first place in errors

anyway someone offered andres gallaraga for bud black i can afford to give up bud black because i still have kyle abbott

however i am afraid of andres actually doing well this season

should i make the trade or not

your comments will be appreciated

from gajarskypilotnjinnet bob gajarsky  hobokenite subject re my belated predictions nl articleid

 pilotapr organization somewhere in hoboken lines  briefly since im off to sleep

mles work pretty well for aa nd aaa players

players who are  and younger will tend to have explosions in their numbers whether mmles or not in the next  years players who are  and older at those levels generally have inflated mles

theyre about as reliable as having major league stats for a player
